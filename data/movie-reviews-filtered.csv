6,"the first underwhelmed me, but this one straight-up bored me. again, of course seeing hunt climb a mountain without a harness is impressive sure. and i even quite liked the idea behind the villain of the piece (though even that angle was woefully underdeveloped).

even setting it in predominantly australia was enough to grab my attention, and that's saying something cause i'm pretty biased when it comes to that. i hear tell that _mission: impossible ii_ is the low point in the series, and that at least is encouraging, because if anything afterwards is much worse than this one, i don't know if i'll be able to make it through to rogue nation.

15,"okay, i will admit i can be a bit of an easy grader when it comes to romantic comedies, as long as they are witty with likable characters, don’t insult my intelligence and have suitable happy endings (i guess if they don’t end happily, they aren’t rom-coms).

i saw this movie many years ago, but had forgotten just enough of it to keep it fresh for me. like many movies, the plot relies on a huge coincidence or three. the story gets sappy and sentimental in places, is rather predictable and has too much religion to suit me, but that last thing may suit you just fine, praise be. it was co-written and directed by the actress bonnie hunt, who is a supporting character in the film.

but there is a spark of chemistry between the two lead characters, the dialogue is smart and sharp, and the movie is rich with its supporting cast, such as jim belushi, robert loggia and archie bunker - i mean carroll o’connor. plus i have liked minnie driver since circle of friends. 

just keep in mind this isn’t hitchcock or frank capra stuff and doesn’t try to be. just let it flow over you",high
20,"**_scream 3’s_ lackluster screenplay and unimaginative kills leave a film that is a bore to watch.**

the meta-narrative of trilogies throughout the film does not make up for how abysmal the plot was. this film creates so much lore for the past movies seemingly out of the blue, muddling up the continuity for shock value. it added very little to this film and felt forced. the entire plot point of sidney’s mother being a former hollywood actress was pretty lame, especially with the added plot point of her being sexually assaulted by a movie producer. it may be personal taste, but i absolutely despise when films add that plot point, as it feels incredibly hypocritical since it is something that genuinely happens to an industry, they are involved in. the love triangle between gale, dewey, and the gale actress was pretty dumb and felt undeserved, as we have not seen gale and dewey actually together in any of the films.

in horror films, you can have a good movie with a terrible plot as long as the kills are great. unfortunately, scream 3 continues the trend of having boring kills with no imagination. there has been only one truly unique kill throughout the entire franchise, and the rest are unbloody stab kills. i understand the meta being about stabbing with a knife, as the in-film movie is called stab, but please add some gore to it. there is nothing, no blood squirts or body horror, and it caused the entire movie to be boring.

our performances were exactly how i would describe scream 2, with both neve campbell and courtney cox being the standouts and david arquette being average at best. all of the new characters were pretty uninteresting, all of the actors in the film were annoying, and the movie producers felt generic.

the direction of this film felt pretty uninspired. i am not sure if wes craven was forced to make this movie by the studio, but nothing about it felt unique and creative. it felt like he was phoning it in for a paycheck.

overall, there were not a lot of redeeming qualities for this film, and it left me feeling unfulfilled as the final credits rolled. hoping scream iv has more in store for me than this lackluster film.

21,"all you people are so scared of me. most days i'd take that as a compliment. but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.

pitch black is directed by david twohy and collectively written by twohy and ken and jim wheat. it stars vin diesel, radha mitchell, cole hauser, keith david, lewis fitz-gerald, claudia black and rhiana griffith. music is by graeme revell and cinematography is by david eggby. 

the year 2000 was awash with sci-fi movies, not all were stellar of course, but siting at the top end of the scale was this, twohy's super slice of action/horror/sci-fi cake. 

right from the off we are thrust on board the cargo ship hunter-gratzner, which as it happens is plummeting through space. the ship has been hit by meteorite debris and junior officer caroline fly (mitchell), after coming out of hyper sleep, manages to crash land on a nearby planet. only a handful of passengers survive the crash, including infamous convict richard b. riddick (diesel), but as the survivors struggle to cope with the threat from within the group, it becomes apparent that there's a bigger threat soon to join the party, a deadly alien species, a species that can only operate in the dark. pity, then, that an eclipse is due... 

okies, so lets get the obvious out in the open right away, pitch black is a variant of alien, one of a ream of films that grabbed the coat tails of ridley scott's game changer. yet this is still a fresh movie, a lesson in low budget film making with grace, style, blood, brains and balls - the execution grade ""a"" from those involved. 

it's maybe surprising given the synopsis, to find that it's a very character driven piece, with twohy continually building his characters even as the carnage and terror is unleashed - and these are a very diverse bunch of characters. one of the universe's baddest criminals, a spunky lady officer having to take command, a morphine addicted bounty hunter, an islamic priest and his young companions, a camp alcoholic and a couple of strays. it's the not so wild bunch, but everyone of them are afforded chance to impact on the story before and during the inevitable picking off one by one at the claws of the beasts. 

the narrative strength comes via diesel's hulking convict, he's double jointed and has had optical surgery so he can see his enemies in the dark! the group must come to rely on him for he is clearly their best hope of survival, but can he be trusted? what is his ultimate ulterior motive? riddick is the épée to fry's foil, it's at times like a devil and angel trying to become one in the simple name of survival. these crux characters lift the simple premise to greater heights, that mitchell (sexy/vulnerable/hard/smart) and diesel (moody/beefy/gravelly/menacing) are bang on form helps no end. as does the work of the tech department. 

the setting created here is a splendid veer from one of the curses of sci-fi films, that of an unbelievable world. twohy, eggby and the art department achieve a world of 3 suns, of a scorched barren landscape, with the photography switching between bleached and metallic filters for maximum sci-fi impact. while the effects work belies the budget, check out the pre-eclipse sequence. what of the creatures themselves? they are legion, a sort of pterodactyl nightmare who let out high pitched bleats, they smell blood and move at high speeds, and like riddick they have special vision in the dark, it's the light that they are afraid of, thus this gives our survivors a glimmer (ahem) of hope in how to stave them off... 

the science and logic is hokey, but so what? this is a classy and taut sci-fi film brought about by a very under valued director, one that puts many a bigger budgeted hollywood production to shame. come the finale, where there's still time to have your draw dropped, you may be minus nails and on the edge of your seat. 9/10",high

31,"**there should have been only one!**

if “highlander 2” was a complete disgrace and “highlander 3” somehow tried to give us some compensation, this movie makes it look worse and more worn out. however, a tv series had been made that had little or nothing to do with the original film. what this movie came to try to do is to bring together the best of both worlds, but it failed completely.

the problems start at the bottom, that is, in the miserably written script and without ideas that can truly be considered good or intelligent. at no time did i feel that the story of this film was interesting or captivating enough to justify the effort of seeing it. from the development it makes, we must assume that the action takes place after what we saw in the original film, which doesn't make much sense if we remember that this film ends in the victory of connor, the last and only immortal. the film has lots of plot holes and moments where logic and coherence take a vacation and disappear. the dialogues are poor, poorly finished and annoying. historical flashbacks don't always work.

the cast counts, for the last time, with the honorable participation of christopher lambert, now a mature actor. so mature it sounds dangerously old for the role he plays. despite this, the actor does what he can with what little he has. adrian paul also doesn't let us down and gives a good performance, considering the filthy and regrettable quality of the material written for this film. bruce payne sounds histrionic and unconvincing, but he does what he has to do. the rest of the actors don't really have anything really good worth mentioning in detail.

victim of a very low budget, the film appears for what it is: a very cheap and undercooked production, which tastes bad and looks even worse than it tastes. an excuse for an action movie with swords and frantic duels amid a series of abandoned or deserted industrial sites. the cinematography, sets and costumes are what we would expect to find, but the visual effects and cgi are poor, amateurish and really inexcusable in a 2000s full-length film. it's a disgraceful film.",low
32,"the art of political film making in all its glory.

""communicate with the soviets? we can't communicate with the pentagon - and it's just across the goddamn river!""

october 1962, for 13 days the american government fought to avert a nuclear war when it was discovered that the soviet union had deployed nuclear missiles in cuba. this is that story.

many superlatives can be chucked at thirteen days, and all are viable. in simple terms it's an intelligent and gripping political thriller, superbly scripted and performed by a cast firing on all cylinders. it's a treat to find a film of this type that educates while it pitches you into a world of political intrigue, to provoke real life thoughts even as the suspense takes a hold. yes it's talky, of course it is, but these conversations are real and riveting. and while there's not a duff performance in the acting pack, bruce greenwood deserves special praise. he is the leader, the fulcrum, there's not a false note by him, jfk becoming the role he was born to play.

superlatives were invented for films like thirteen days. assuredly so. 9.5/10",high
33,"kevin costner at least tried to do an accent in this movie, which probably means he got a new agent, a yes man that didn't bother to give him the advice that doing believable accents isn't his thing.  it's almost like listening to your average brit trying to sound like an american and completely overdoing it.

do we really sound that exaggerated to them?

who cares, ignore the above, it's still a good movie... despite costner's accent.  or, possibly, in spite of it.

it trashes dean achenson, and as a historian the only thing i like to see more than dean getting his just deserts is allen dulles getting his... and it throws a jab at that a**hole too.  in 2000 that would have been seen as pure liberal honesty, but now it sort of comes across as far right.  i mean the movie is literally about avoiding nuclear war with russia as the entire democratic party and the progressive movement seem to want to push us closer and closer to it.

it's one of the better political films you can see, and it builds the pressure to the point where you are terrified that the world could end despite the fact it has long come and gone.  and the shift from jack and bobby to ken o'donnel, a humble appointment secretary is probably one of the best approaches and best ideas any historical drama has ever had.

start to finish it is one of the best political thrillers of all time.",high
34,"what came first - the music or the misery?

high fidelity is directed by stephen frears and adapted to screenplay by d.v. devincentis, steve pink, john cusack and scott rosenberg from the nick hornby novel. it stars cusack, jack black, iben hjejle and todd louiso. music is by howard shore and cinematography by seamus mcgarvey.

record store owner and compulsive list-compiler rob gordon (cusack), embark's upon a what does it all mean mission when his latest girlfriend leaves him.

cusack and pink take hornby's hugely popular novel and redirect it to chicago, with joyous results. high fidelity is a tale of human love and a love of music, a sort of battle of the sexes with a soundtrack of masculine life. rob's voyage of self discovery is highly amusing, the trials and tribulations of relationships bringing out a number of scenes and scenarios that ring true, not just tickling the funny bones, but also tugging the heart and cradling the brain.

away from the doomed love angles it's the music threads that literally strike the chords. rob and his two co-workers barry (black) & dick (louiso) worship music and continually indulge in making top 5 lists whilst bickering with sarcastic glee in the process. all three actors are superb, a trio of odd balls bouncing off of one and other with a zest that's infectious, though it's decidedly cusack's show. a perpetual miserablist who addresses us the audience at frequent intervals, rob in cusack's hands garners sympathy, pity and laughs in equal measure.

in the support slots is a ream of talent well in on the joke, beauties like catherine zeta-jones (dropping f-bombs like they are going out of fashion), lisa bonet & joelle carter are complimented by the comic skills of joan cusack, while hjejle turns in a wily and womanly performance as the girlfriend who kicks starts rob's search for meaning. elsewhere the sight of tim robbins as a new age hippy type - with a black belt in martial arts - is so much fun it reminds of what a good comic actor he can be as well. 

as with grosse point blank, another cusack/pink production, sound tracking is everything, and naturally given the setting of the story there is an abundance of classic tunes to delight in. all told it's a special movie, for all sexes and for all music lovers, but especially for anyone who has had relationship problems. now what did come first, the music or the misery? priceless. 9/10",high
51,"_**a black detective in gotham desperately wants to nail a snooty racist murderer**_ 

the nephew of the original john shaft is a detective in new york city (samuel l. jackson) where he tries to apprehend an arrogant racist killer (christian bale) by finding a key witness (toni collette) while dealing with a gang lord (jeffrey wright) and corrupt cops. vanessa williams is on hand as a helpful officer.

“shaft” (2000) is a ‘hip’ crime thriller that resurrects the franchise 27 years after the original trilogy from 1971-1973 that featured richard roundtree in the title role (he returns here as the aged uncle). the cast and filmmaking are fine; the problem is the lame story with which they’re shackled. 

the key crime in the opening act is glaringly weak. bale’s character is a snooty punk born with a silver spoon in his mouth, but i didn’t buy his rash, racist actions at the night club. it just didn’t ring true, especially since he seems to get along with black people just fine the rest of the movie. likewise, collette’s actions aren’t convincing as the doe-eyed bartender. simply put, the scriptwriters tried too hard to concoct a racist whitey villain when subtly was in order.

if you can roll with that serious flaw, there are enough thrills to amuse, including jackson as the bad axx protagonist and wright’s entertaining drug lord. plus it’s always good to see the charming vanessa williams. 

the film runs 1 hour, 39 minutes, and was shot in various areas of new york city, as well as nearby newark.

65,"gladiator has been my most favorite film of all time. it is an epic masterpiece in many ways and it really explains why despite the numerous viewings, gladiator still amuses me with its powerful imageries and many other crucial aspects so that it won five academy awards. this film is very well written, the well-ensemble casts, the a-class acting (especially russell crowe and joaquin phoenix), the stunning cinematography and definitely a strong character of maximus (magnificently portrayed by russell crowe) whose life, struggle, disappointment and anger really move the audience, as if the world attention centers on him. gladiator is not a historical film, because it only used the history of the ancient roman empire merely as the time setting.
all other aspects namely those gorgeous shots, the great storyline/plot, the fantastic cinematography, the vividly lavish colors, detailed production design and digital imaging (that successfully rebuilt the stunning beauty of the ancient roman empire) and all sell really well, making the 170 minute-long running time definitely worthwhile. the visual of great battle in the first 15 minutes really stole my heart. the gruesome pictures, the blood and violence just to beautiful to abandon. everything in this movie seems perfectly balanced, ridley scott as the film director really did his homework well in redefining and revitalizing the big battle sequence once considered masterpiece from spartacus and ben hur. in the end, once again, i would say that gladiator perfectly combines some crucial elements such as good, moving story, dazzling visual, beautiful scenery, filming techniques, direction and touching music score into one harmonious, action-packed film about heroism and its true meaning.",high
66,"they said you were a giant. they said you can crush a man's skull with one hand.

ridley scott's gladiator is not a perfect film, i would think that the hardiest of fans, of which i'm firmly one, know this deep down. yet just like commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does gladiator the film. enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the academy award acknowledgements it received.

in narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something scott and russell crowe have never shied away from. there has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt gladiator owes to anthony mann's 1964 epic, the fall of the roman empire. some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. and it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post gladiator's success is there for all to see.

what we do in life echoes in eternity.

so no originality in story, then. while some of the cgi is hardly ""grade a"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel, actually overrides film making irks. crowe's maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. as he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny - with crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the academy award for best actor that he should have won for the insider the previous year.

backing crowe up is joaquin phoenix giving commodus preening villainy and connie nielsen graceful as lucilla (pitch nielsen's turn here against that of diane kruger's in troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). oliver reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as proximo the gladiator task master. olly superb in both body and cgi soul. richard harris tugging the heart strings, derek jacobi classy, david hemmings also, while djimon hounso gives juba - maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

i didn't know man could build such things.

dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. the flaming arrows and blood letting of the germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and scott and his team never sag from this standard. the gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the battle of carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. and then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from scott and crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. a great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. bravo maximus decimus meridius. 10/10",high
69,"""gladiator,"" directed by ridley scott and released in 2000, is undeniably one of the best movies ever made. a cinematic masterpiece that effortlessly blends action, drama, and history, this film leaves an indelible mark on all who watch it.

at the heart of ""gladiator"" are the remarkable performances by russell crowe and joaquin phoenix. crowe's portrayal of maximus decimus meridius is nothing short of breathtaking. his stoic determination, unwavering loyalty, and charismatic presence make him the perfect embodiment of a hero. joaquin phoenix, on the other hand, delivers a chillingly convincing performance as the treacherous commodus. his portrayal of the power-hungry and morally bankrupt emperor is both mesmerizing and repulsive, showcasing his exceptional acting prowess.

what sets ""gladiator"" apart from other films is its ability to evoke genuine emotions. the story of maximus, a loyal general who seeks revenge for the murder of his family and the betrayal of his emperor, touches the very core of our humanity. the film explores themes of honor, justice, and the indomitable spirit of the human soul, making it a truly timeless narrative.

i would rewatch it anytime and recommend it to anyone. it's a solid 10/10, truly an amazing masterpiece.",high

gossip is a dramatic thriller that was made fifteen years too late. the story sounds like something that could have been believable in the 80's but not for the 2000s, rape kits and a thorough investigation solves the plot. it's pretty to look at and the cast is excellent but the rest of it is unbelievable.",low

ordinarily i would write a review that is fair minded and as honest as i can call it, something that hopefully would interest the readers either side of the fence. but here with the perfect storm i just want to write why i love this particular picture, and what a most divisive picture it has turned out to be. i'm aware of the complaints about the movie, even the ones from the family of the real captain billy tyne {played by alpha male regular george clooney}, but as an entertaining spectacle with huge slices of emotional fortitude, the perfect storm will forever be hitting my spots. 

the character build up is just wonderful, people with things to prove, fractured and blossoming romances, loyalties on the line, grudges carried over from previous encounters, the lives of sea fishermen fully formed in the films first quarter. then there is a sequence as george clooney says the monologue that i have opened this review with, beautifully recited, but it's the emotion in linda greenlaw's face (mary elizabeth mastrantonio) as she watches and listens to him speak it, just wonderful. then the boys go out to see, heading off into dangerous waters to hopefully make a killing in the fish market, tensions run high, accidents happen, heroes are born and rivalries quickly overturned, but the boys must go further if they are to corner the market, the grand banks are evil at this time of year. 

a three pronged hostile weather front is heading their way, they are, as linda tells billy on the radio, heading into the belly of the monster, and what a monster it is. here the makers excel, director wolfgang petersen, his cinematographer john seale and his s/e maestro john frazier do literally put me right there in a amongst the waves and derringdo bravado. then it's the final couple of reels, the emotional mangler, even a spiritual coda that is hated by so many can't make me dislike the film any less, and i'll wager right here and now that as funeral eulogies go, few if any have been delivered with as much heartbreaking emotion as the one read by mastrantonio here. all of which is backed by a truly involving score by james horner, shades of braveheart's emotional swirls in there. 

it's a personal opinion you know, but the perfect storm is a magnificent film that i enjoy three times a year, every year, and nobody will ever be able to take that away from me.

what to say about darren aronofsky's requiem for a dream that hasn't been said already? without doubt it's a film, that in spite of its high standing on the main movie sites, polarises opinions. it's a film that in simple terms follows four people through their addictions until the shattering denouement, but the journey is made more bleak by offering tantalising snatches of hope, the dreams of the protags offered up as some sort of goals for the addicts to cling on to - only for the narrative to stick in its rusty serrated blade to draw the lifeblood from the hapless hopefuls.

arononfsky brings a multitude of technical skills to the party that emphasise the emotional discord on show. standard split-screening is married up with rapid cutting, isolated framing, close ups, long tracking and snorricam, all of which is sound tracked by clint mansell's haunting musical composition. all told it's an assault on all the senses and terrifying with it, boosted no end by aronofsky getting top performances from his cast of actors. love it or hate it, it's a film that simply can't be ignored, unsparing cinema produced by a most gifted director. 9/10",high

80,"hopes, dreams & nightmares.

almost famous is cameron crowe's paean to rock music, of bands and songs, of journalism and promotion, of sex & drugs. drawing from experience and stories passed on, crowe tells the tale of a young teenage boy aspiring to be a music journalist in the 1970s. finding himself backstage with the rock group stillwater, william miller (patrick fugit) embarks on a road journey with the band that's awash with egos, groupies, perils and pleasures, all of which change his life forever.

lets go find something real!

the most striking thing about it is that it's not overtly funny or sensationalistic, it's a production that's full of love, real love, for the subject matters to hand, and it's very often a moving experience to be part of. narratively speaking, crowe takes his time, steadily building characters and backdrop essentials, it works a treat as we become immersed in all the major players within the music circle, while also feeling the concerns of those on the outside of the rock group circle. which of course gives us the great rewards come the final third of film when all matters come to a head. crowe and his design team also work some magic for period flavours, capturing the early 70s vibe with awareness of clothing, food and drink and transport. nothing ever seems false, which is remarkable in this era of product placements and shameless plugging. 

50 bucks and a case of beer! 

another one of crowe's strengths is how he garners great performances from his actors. there's no big stars here, no tom or renée, but billy crudup, jason lee, kate hudson and fugit, who respond to their director with sincere and believable performances, no caricatures or ham sarnies here, no way. while outskirt performances from frances mcdormand (brilliant as william's fretful mother), anna paquin, philip seymour hoffman (as the legendary lester bangs) and fairuza balk, consistently hit the hi-hat. the music of course rocks, from metal and progers, to folkers and bubblegum, to some punk godfathery, these sounds feature on the soundtrack and kick the decade into orbit - while the stillwater scenes are effective and the use of elton john's tiny dancer will land in your heart and stay there.

cameron crowe has created a smashingly memorable film that will stand the tests of time. two cuts are available, where both the theatrical and director's cuts are sure fire things (the latter bootleg cut my personal favourite). this is a music based film to sit with the best of them, god bless rock n roll and god bless cameron crowe, for he could have easily embellished and over egged his rock pudding, instead he kept it real. 9/10",high

83,"you see a lot of people here calling this one of their favorite movies. it's certainly one of mine. but, twenty years after i've found myself wondering if it's the movie that i like or if it's the music.

i mean, it references lester bangs, and he is played by hoffman. and it is a crowe film. but it's about rolling stone when rolling stone was important and not the hallow shadow of it's former self.

and with that tale about rolling stone's former glory it tells the story about rock and roll before it caved into new wave, disco, and was finally washed away with the auto-tune and drum machine bubblegum pop that needs a mass burning in soldier field in the near future.

but look at the sound track, simon and garfunkle, the who, iggy pop, black sabbath, rod stewart, the allman brothers, the seeds, fleetwood mac, everyone's favorite led zeppelin, deep purple, lynyrd skynyrd, cat stevens, and my favorite elton john song.

and those are just the highlights. but, that is a playlist, that is an record collection. most everyone has an album by one of those bands.

and, of course, still water is a place savor for the allman brothers and in some cases it's so obvious it hurts.

so, is it one of my favorite films? twenty years on do i really love this film or do i love the soundtrack? do i love the era it portrays when rock was still relevant and the rolling stone still meant something?

from the opening, and terrifying air crash sequence to the clever and gross way that our protagonists shake hands with the grim reaper, this film is gloriously proud of its horror intent. one peak at the surnames of the characters will tell you just how into their horror roots the makers are here, whilst not a homage movie as such, james wong and his team clearly know what makes a modern horror picture work.

125,"**an excuse to make a film full of women swaying seductively without a hint of softcore.**

what can we say about a romantic film, with light touches of comedy, that spends most of its time showing us very attractive women in tight, short clothes, and bouncing around sensually in an atmosphere of mockery and debauchery worthy of a university graduation party? a lot of things. what leaves us no doubt? it is a film made with an openly and openly heterosexual audience in mind. released in 2000, i don't know if the film would be possible today without being immediately accused of sexism and giving a stereotypical and sexualized image of women.

let's start by talking about the good things. one of them, perhaps the best, is the extraordinary soundtrack, which compiles excellent songs into one of the best non-original soundtracks of the decade: “the right kind of wrong” and “can't fight the moonlight” are so good that the entire we know them. the music is so important here that, in a sense, it is more of a music video than a film: the protagonist is an aspiring songwriter who tries to make it in the music market without much success, but who discovers that she sings well and becomes one of the main attractions. of a nightclub.

the scenarios are convincing enough for us to believe them, especially if it is known that there really is a bar of this type in new york (in fact, it seems that others in the same franchise have already opened). even so, there is so much exaggeration at parties that it is, in my eyes, difficult to believe in a certified and legal commercial space. minimally decent editing, but sometimes lax, and cinematography that relies too heavily on red tones complete, on a less positive note, the more technical aspects of this film.

in addition to the good songs, we have the beauty of the cast, with young and slender actresses, who make up for their inexperience with fantastic bodies and good dancing skills: piper perabo, maria bello, tyra banks, izabella miko, bridget moynahan and adam garcia. it's a shame that physical beauty doesn't translate into talent: as the cast wasn't chosen based on the actors' abilities, none of them offer an inspired performance. they are a bunch of complete scoundrels and the film, at this point, is very weak. in the interest of justice, it is imperative to save the renowned john goodman, the only good actor here, who shows us what it is like to act in a character full of grace and quite comical.

all of these, however, are mere stumbling blocks on the long road of a production that could, even so, be frankly good if it told us a good story. it is in the script and the story told that the film falls to the ground like an aspiring model who breaks both heels while parading. when watching the film, i asked myself over and over again where the hell the script was, because all that, that whole trip to the city, to a future in show business, is so absolutely cliché and has already been repeated so much that it is unacceptable. there is no substance. then, all that sugary romance, without any chemistry, without any logic... it's too stupid, with stupid and unacceptably poorly written dialogues.",low

136,"we all lie to ourselves to be happy.

it's not until a film like memento comes along, or that you personally have to deal with someone close who suffers a form of this subject to hand, that you get jolted to remember just how your memory is such a prized and treasured thing - and crucially that it's one of your key safety devices.

christopher and jonathan nolan crafted one of the best films of 2000 based on those facets of the human condition. their protagonist is leonard shelby, played with stupendous believability by guy pearce, who is suffering from a memory amnesia caused by a trauma to the head as he tried to aide his wife who was raped and murdered. he can remember things before the incident, but anything post that and he can't form a memory. so who can he trust? does he know any of the few people who appear to be in his life at the present time? he tattoos his body to help him remember, constantly writes notes to keep him alert in his now alien world, while all the time he is on the search for the man who ruined his life.

christopher nolan plants the audience right into leonard's world. by using a reverse story telling structure it's deliberately complex and ingenious given that it opens with the ending! it has been argued that it's trickery for trickery sake, style over substance, but the way each scene is built upon in the narrative is a thing of high quality, it's all relevant and demands the closest of attention from the viewer, where cheekily we are ourselves asked to form memories of prior narrative passages. mystery is strong throughout, the characters currently in leonard's life may have different means and motives, it keeps us alert, with the confusion, lies, manipulations, enigmas and amnesia angles booming with neo-noir vibrancy. and the nolan's know their noir of course, adding a narrator who is hard to define or trust himself!

the reverse structure wasn't new in 2000, but christopher nolan picks up the idea and adds new strands to it, simultaneously bringing his visual ticks as david julyan's musical score shifts from elegiac forebodings to pulse pounding dread, and as evidenced by the darling easter egg option that allows one to watch it in chronological order, it's a damn fine thriller without the reverse trickery anyway. super. 9/10",high

138,"‘memento’ is director christopher nolan’s tribute to classic film noir tales of revenge and mystery. by adding a new twist to traditional conventions, nolan is able to consume and grip the viewer throughout the entire film and for years after. the aspect that differentiates this neo-noir from its competitors today is its jumbled and complex narrative which continually moves backwards in time. the viewers first see the main character complete his revenge murder (a triumphant scene we usually associate with the ending of film noirs). we then begin to see events unfold backwards and the reason for this becomes clear.

leonard shelby (guy pearce) and his wife are attacked in their home. his wife is murdered but guy pearce is left with a brain condition that disables him from creating anymore short-term memory. constantly being reminded of the horror of the situation, he is relentlessly spurred on to get his revenge on his wife’s killer. as the viewer progresses through the film, they begin to feel more and more like lenny. the audience have no idea of what has happened prior to the scene currently showing and so we are left feeling the same confusion as our protagonist. to cope with his condition, he maintains a system of notes, photographs, and tattoos to record information about himself and others, including his wife's killer. he is aided in his investigation by ""teddy"" (joe pantoliano) and natalie (carrie-anne moss), neither of whom he can really trust (both of the latter actors starred together in ‘the matrix (1999)’ in which pantoliano was not to be trusted, disorientating the informed viewer more).

the film's events unfold in two separate, alternating narratives—one in colour, and the other in black and white. leonard's investigation is depicted in five-minute colour sequences that are in reverse chronological order, however, the short black and white scenes are shown in chronological order and show leonard on the phone to a mysterious stranger having a conversation that the viewers cannot understand (these sequences are more direct references to the film noir genre that christopher nolan is embracing). this style of directing makes the audience completely empathise with leonard’s situation as you never know more than he does, but also it creates huge comedic and emotional moments which rely heavily on the notion of dramatic irony.

with nolan’s use of handheld camera work, an overtone of pink colouring, and sharp editing (the only transition effects in use are occasional fade outs) the viewer is made to feel disorientated and is therefore able to empathise more with leonard’s character. the original idea was a short story by nolan’s brother, jonathan who also helped with the screenplay. the dialogue in the film is its best feature with its insightful, powerful and heart-wrenching speeches about the nature of memory. as we learn how we rely upon memory for our sense of reality, we begin to question reality itself.  the idea of faith and constant references to the bible can make the entire film a metaphor for people’s faith in christianity or any other religion at that.

144,"in greek mythology, the titans were greater even than the gods.

based on real events in 1971, where t.c. williams high school, a now hot bed integrated school, becomes a beacon of unification via their mixed race football team.

as is normally the case with films of this ilk, it quickly comes to pass that certain artistic licence has been taken with the truth. in reality the issues of race, integration and the near powder-keg atmosphere portrayed in the picture, were long past their worst in virginia 1971. however, that should in no way detract from the thematics and truthful aspects of this disney production. as is told in the film, the titans did have what became known as the perfect season, whilst the bond formed between the black and white members most definitely existed. all told, the film soars high as an inspirational piece, not only for the mixed race community coming together plot's essential being, but in the crucial tale of one gerry bertier.

that this film urged me to seek out the story of bertier is a testament to the power of film, regardless of any sort of sentimental prodding from the film makers. it's hoped that this film also prompts newcomers to research further the topics within the story.

the cast list is impressive, denzel washington and will patton find instant chemistry as the head coaches thrust together by outside influences, with both guys beautifully doing credit to the real life friendship that would be born from the situation. ryan hurst, wood harris, ethan suplee, donald faison, kip pardue, craig kirkwood and a pre-fame ryan gosling fill out the integrated football team. while two important female family roles are nicely portrayed by hayden panettiere and nicole ari parker. the soundtrack is nicely put together, with the core offering of marvin gaye and tammi terrell's thumping rendition of ""ain't no mountain high enough"" particularly potent and uplifting. 

though not primarily offering up anything new in the pantheon of race and sport related movies, remember the titans does have so much good going for it. it's hard to be picky, even churlish about the little faults (are these actors really the age of high schoolers for example?), so hopefully come the end, after the credits roll, you will be suitably inspired and perhaps a touch more better off for having spent time with this particular football team. 8.5/10",high
146,"ok, well, reading through the bad reviews there are some grudges here based on, well, how the other teams were depicted because 1971 wasn't long enough for some of the people that played them to pass on their mortal coils.

i can relate to that. i grew up countryfied and have tasted the salt of playing against a school that was three or four times our size, schools that could afford to cherry-pick who played. schools where the defense could rest when the offense was on the field...apparently t.c. williams was one of those giant schools.

i can sympathize with some of the negative reviews here...because, honestly, if they made a movie like this about woodstock, i'd give it 1 star out of principal. seriously, no, we might be hicks, but we rotate from linebacker to offensive tackle. when you faced off against schools that had an actual student body, you knew you were going to lose, the only question was how hard were you going to make their victory. sounds like t.c. williams was one of those giant schools.

ok, rant done.

i caught this on tnt and the music drew me in right away. hear a good song it catches your ear and drags you in.

and this has the acting to back it up. it's very... nice seeing washington not playing the smart-cop role or a variation there of. he can act, he can act well, and this is one of the movies where he's not playing the same role over and over again. so, when he comes out of that shell and gets a gig playing a role he doesn't always play... it's kind of a treat isn't it?

of course the highlight was really hayden panettiere, not because she was absolutely adorable in the film (which she was), but more because she did a great job of turning a little girl into that parent, on the sidelines, that thinks he's ditka, so she was not only adorable but hysterical.

the hippie, ryan gosling?, was another little gem, not because he did a particularly good job acting, though it was fair enough. no, he stood out because anyone that's payed football knew someone like him. it gave it a bit of an authentic feel.

the only real downside was that, by 1971, schools were integrated and been for a while. it kind of lost that authenticity when they went that route. but, you know what, who cares, it was entertaining enough despite that.

it was a solid football movie.

and for all the 1 star reviews, particularly those written by people from the smaller schools that had to go up against the titans... i feel for you. i remember being in that situation and i'd be bitter too if the giant school had a movie made about them that suggested they were in anyway the under-dog.",high

it often gets forgotten just what an exciting talent m. night shyamalan was during the early part of his film making career. true that unbreakable, with its deliberate slow pacing and left-field narrative, would (and has) proved to be not everyone's cup-o-tea, but there's a film making craft here, and a genius idea brought to vivid life, that makes a spectrum of film lovers lament how his career nose dived, how his ideas quickly got as stupid as his acting...

unbreakable challenges the thought process, spinning a story that's of a adult comic book heart, but also of a clinical human examination. the narrative is consistently ambiguous, holding the patient viewers in enthral as the cosmic conundrums come tumbling off of the screen. it's refreshing to find a story like this that is so devoid of cliché, where the wonderfully reflective bruce willis and the brilliantly fascinating samuel l. jackson feed off each other, their character's destinies superbly steered by cast and director. unbreakable is a complex movie, but not needlessly so, its strengths are numerous for those of a keen eye and ear. it represents shyamalan's most clever cinematic offering, to which the sad realisation comes to pass that he would never, as yet, be this smart and vibrant again. 10/10",high
158,"if you enjoy reading my spoiler-free reviews, please follow my blog :)

what a movie! this is one of the most underrated films out there, and it was unfairly compared to the sixth sense at the time the former was released. these are two very different movies, but both of them have a lot of twists, which was what brought fame to shyamalan's films, especially the sixth sense.

unbreakable follows that same methodology. it has a lot of twists throughout the runtime, and they are quite diverse: some are very technical twists, related to our point of view of a particular scene that, as it progresses, we always find ourselves tricked (these ones, most people either don't catch them or just don't care ... for me, it's proof of brilliant writing); the others are the prominent plot twists, where something unpredictable happens to the overall story.

this movie has all of that and much more. the story itself is incredibly captivating since the main plot holds a lot of mystery and suspense, but these only work as well as they did thanks to shyamalan, both director and screenwriter. his very unconventional way of storytelling and the anxiety that he's able to convey to some fantastic scenes, elevate the film while delivering a perfect narrative. it's even more mind-blowing the fact that this movie still makes so much sense and it didn't lose its replay value after 17 years!

in fact, i bet it would be a striking success nowadays, where the superhero genre is over-saturated. each year, we get more and more movies following the excessively used genre's formula that makes almost every blockbuster an instant box office hit. unbreakable is nowhere near that formula, and i genuinely think that any fan of comic-book films must watch this one so everyone can understand what a ""grounded superhero movie"" actually means. m. night shyamalan wrote a story that everyone can appreciate, without all of those big cgi fights and overwhelming visual effects. comic-book fan or not, unbreakable is the closest to what reality would be if superheroes really existed.

regarding the cast, bruce willis probably has his career-best dramatic performance in this film. he's terrific as david and i can feel all of the emotions which he wants to transmit to the screen. samuel l. jackson brilliantly plays elijah, who has a real-life disease which slj portrayed beautifully and respectfully. the supporting cast is also worth praising since both robin wright (audrey dunn) and spencer treat clark (joseph dunn) play magnificent roles as the wife and son of david, respectively.

everyone helped shyamalan direct exquisite dialogue sequences that extended for minutes without end. the editing and production of this movie are unbelievable ... and it was filmed in 2000! there are so many long, one-take scenes that explain in just a few minutes, everything you need to know about a character or a specific place or event ... even a full action sequence is filmed in just one-take (the stunt work is also pretty efficient)! the soundtrack is so important, especially in the last act where everything comes to a conclusion. it's inspirational and even epic, i dare calling it. it's just perfect! throughout the runtime, you can barely notice it due to how subtle it is. however, when it is needed to deliver a new layer of feelings, it always raises the moment.

as discussed above, this is a m. night shyamalan film, so a very powerful twist right at the end needs to happen ... and it does. it gives the audience an unpredictable perspective about the whole story. i risk myself in saying that it isn't exactly necessary, but the truth is that it makes sense and it does bring the movie to a whole other level, so very, very well done! finally, i just wish that this film had been released now. it is so much different than what we are used to watching and experiencing, that i dare to say it is one of the best movies inside this genre.

once again, shyamalan shows the audience why was he becoming one of the most popular directors/screenwriters and proves that his rather unconventional storytelling, unpredictable twists and excellent direction are skills to praise more often. bruce willis and samuel l. jackson have great chemistry, but the former has his career-best dramatic performance. the editing, production, soundtrack and even the pacing of this film are entirely flawless, as well as the ending twist that leaves us with our jaws dropped. unbreakable is one of the most underrated superhero movies ever, but it sits way on top as one of my favorites.",high

168,"brooking no argument, history should quickly regard peter jackson’s the fellowship of the ring as the first instalment of the best fantasy epic in motion picture history. this statement is worthy of investigation for several reasons.

fellowship is indeed merely an opening salvo, and even after three hours in the dark you will likely exit the cinema ravenous with anticipation for the further two parts of the trilogy. fellowship is also unabashedly rooted in the fantasy genre. not to be confused with the techno-cool of good science fiction, nor even the cutesy charm of family fare like harry potter, the territory of tolkien is clearly marked by goo and goblins and gobbledegook. persons with an aversion to lines such as, “to the bridge of khazad-dûm!” are as well to stay within the shire-like comforts of home (their loss).

with those caveats in place, it bears repeating: fantasy does not come finer. there are electrifying moments — notably the computer-assisted swooping camera through isengard as it transforms into a factory for evil — when jackson’s flight of fancy approaches the sublime as the romantic poets would understand it: inspiring awe.

leaving aside the thorny issue of tolkien die-hards and their inevitable gripes — “what no tom bombadil?” — jackson’s screenplay (written in collaboration with fran walsh and phillipa boyens) is both bolder and more judicious than steven kloves’ surprisingly timid retread of harry potter. in particular, rescuing the romance of arwen and aragorn from the footnotes and the elevation of saruman to all-action bad guy actually has a corrective influence on tolkien’s often oblique and female-sparse source material.

there are problems, though. the three-hour running time is high on incident and low on discernible form. after successive detours to elf habitats rivendell (the watery home of elrond) and lothlórien (the forest home of the lady galadriel), the uninitiated might well ask why these crazy elf kids can’t just live together and spare us all this attenuated dramatic structure.

more importantly, the action clearly climaxes in the desperate flight from the mines of moria, where the largely seamless sfx is showcased in the best possible light — total darkness — but the narrative demands a different, downbeat ending. indeed, but for some fine emotional playing from bean, mortensen, astin and wood, the final fight might feel like a particularly brutal game of paintball in bluebell wood. but then, the real battles are yet to come...


verdict - putting formula blockbusters to shame, fellowship is impeccably cast and constructed with both care and passion: this is a labour of love that never feels laboured. emotional range and character depth ultimately take us beyond genre limitations, and it deserves to play as wide as a certain mr. potter.

175,"this film may be perfect.
based on the fantasy world written by tolkien, we see the halfling hobbits, the most unlikely of heroes, a breed of human type beings who indulge in pleasures, games, and fun, and do little evil.
in the same world are more powerful beings, some good, like the elves and wizards, some evil, like the orcs, trolls, and dragons, and some in between, like the dwarves and men.
and one evil super being, sauron, the second in command to the ""devil"" of this world called middle earth, and that devil called melkor is now in chains and powerless, so sauron rules all evil.
that said, we get a very faithful version to the book, only improved. this is the first of three segments called ""the lord of the rings"". the parts left out are parts best left out. tom bombadil, for example, along with his wife, represents a very hitler like aryan ideology of supremacy that tolkien often engaged in. 
the film begins with a narrative and action sequence that is awesome, and then goes into the ""status quo"" setting of the ""shire"" of hobbits, much like the status quo setting of films like ""women of dolwyn"".

188,"this movie is meh at best.  the plot is so-so.  this isn't anything to write home about.  you could make it into a b-movie and no one would care.

no one likes training day for training day... they all just love denzel washington's performance in training day, and that is just an honest fact.  

the movie wouldn't be anything if he didn't deliver and what he delivered was so sensational that people are going to be talking about it decades after we pass.  and that is what people like.  they like how deliciously evil denzel was in the role.  they like that he had free reign, as a villain, to make the role as memorable as possible.  and he did, he knocked it out of the park.

so now, people watch training day, but let's be honest, they are only watching it for denzel washington, and that is as it should be, he was stellar in this, he deserves the recognition, and it's one of those movies that is otherwise so meh that his performance just shines out as the only thing really great about it.

i can understand why some viewers find jurassic park iii fun enough. i just can't tolerate it, sorry. it feels more like a parody than a serious attempt at making a good sequel. the suspense and sense of wonder are totally gone. even the cgi-animatronics combo looks terrible.

i also couldn't stand the new characters, ugh. i may come back tomorrow and think differently, but fallen kingdom has more redeemable qualities, despite it also being pretty awful and even offensive to fans of the saga.

i just don't imagine myself rewatching iii ever again.

rating: d-",low
196,"i guess you could call this jurassic park lite.  everything about it is reduced. it has a much shorter running time and the plot is contracted to the point that it is just about a handful of people looking for a child in a violently wild zoo. they enticed sam neil back into the cast, and to a lesser extent laura dern, but the movie seems to feel the absence of jeff goldblum’s ian character. the script seems to recognize this lack as they have alan grant whipping out quotes and theories of ian’s. meanwhile i think william h. macy’s talents might have been a bit wasted in his role.

it is an entertaining little film, at least, as they threw in the obligatory sigh-inspiring shots of herds of large dinosaurs and spots of humor. i could have done without the ascension of the raptors to the status of being thinking, plotting creatures who would have been superior to humans if they only hadn’t been wiped out by that pesky asteroid. i thought that was a bit extreme.  i thought the best moment came when alan realized the the bridge they were crossing was part of an aviary for the pterodactyls.",high
199,"i figured i saw the first two, i might as well see this one, too. dr. alan grant (sam neill) is tricked into going to the second island by amanda (tea leoni) and paul (william h. macy) kirby, who are looking for their missing son eric (trevor morgan). a few supporting players go, too, to provide food for the dinosaurs without caring about the loss of their characters. there is lots of running, a climax that never happens, and the promise of another sequel that wouldn't come.

forgive the short synopsis, the truth is this film steals tons from the first two films. there is a ""dinosaur poop"" scene, and another character supposedly dies and we must waste our time watching for him to appear hurt but alive. i would compare this film to the awful ""back to the future part ii."" it was also released to kind of tie-in the future episodes, but does not stand well on its own. if you are going to continue a major action franchise, you would think the third film would be even bigger than the first two. no such luck here. the special effects run hot and cold. good dinosaur graphics, but what is with the script? the film makers decided the audience wants nothing but dinosaur attacks, and throws in all sorts of them. these do not seem to take on any sort of breakneck speed, this just looks like a resume tape for stan winston's special effects. this is a greatest hits compilation of people getting chased, attacked, and eaten, in all its pg-13 gory glory, without any sort of suspense or scares. action scenes would start, like the dinosaur at the steel fence, then end as the humans would run away, talk, then get chased again. would everyone stop teaming sam neill with children? the teenage boy here is better than the lovey-dovey cutesy-wutesey duo from the first film, but i was sick of seeing his heart melted by youth. speaking of youth, i literally cannot remember anything about neill's young protege, billy (alessandro nivola). his character is so vacuous and laid back, he disappears from the screen. i kept thinking ""who is that? oh, yeah, billy with some stolen raptor eggs."" macy and leoni are okay, but better than this material. if you have seen the first two, you might as well see ""jurassic park iii"" as well. it is not any good, but when has that stopped a major motion picture studio from shoving a middling franchise down our  throats?",low
205,"**today, i finally understood this movie… and i was amazed by it.**

i think what happened to me was exactly the same as what happened to most people: when i saw this movie for the first time, years ago, i didn't understand a thing. that went on for a long time: whenever i saw this film, i ended up not understanding it. that ended today, when i saw it with a friend of mine, who also likes cinema and who told me _“you have to keep two things in mind: the first is the non-linear narrative, sometimes with very subtle changes; the second is that most of the film is not real life, it is a dream of the protagonist”_.

if there are films that are almost perfect, this one is close to it, although it is not easy to understand, and it is necessary to watch it five or six times to understand it well. i had already the experience that david lynch's films are not easy... i had my first contact with the director a few years ago, with _blue velvet_, and i realized that he makes hermetic films, with implicit ideas and dreamlike suggestions, which often (almost always) escape our eyes. i like that: it's a challenging kind of cinema, which makes you think and moves you. it doesn't mean that i understand everything! and today, talking with my friend, i finally managed to understand this film better. initially made in 1999 as a pilot episode for a tv series, it was made into a feature film after tv producers rejected the product. the very way lynch took his failure and turned it into one of his biggest hits is remarkable, revealing his style and persistence.

the film is really good, and i believe that, by commenting on what i learned today, i am already helping those who want to see it and understand it. if we pay attention, it indicates the moments when the main character falls asleep (right at the beginning) and wakes up again. and i think i can still say, without revealing too much, that the party at the film director's house, very close to the end, is the key scene to understand more than half of the plot, which basically focuses on a young woman, who goes to los angeles with the dream of becoming rich and famous and fails in that desire, combining this frustration with a huge love heartbreak, and the loss of her own moral values ​​and innocence.

the cast is perfectly up to the challenges they're getting from the director, and it's amazing to see naomi watts here. this film truly symbolizes the start of her career, as she only did a few minor jobs, in europe and the usa, until making this film. she is truly excellent, managing to capture all our sympathy and make us like her character. to a certain extent, i think the actress saw a lot of herself in the character she played: she also had a dream of succeeding in her career, and she also suffered to achieve it. also, laura harring did very well and deserves praise for her work. justin theroux, who played director adam kesher, makes a welcome and solid contribution to the work of the actresses, even though this film is clearly dominated by them.

technically, this is a film class at all levels. in addition to the brilliant direction, lynch bets a lot on cinematography. here, it is worth seeing how he uses the locations he chooses, the cityscapes, and some techniques such as zoom, close-up or blur, to convey messages to the audience about the characters' state of mind. he also makes good use of color, vibrant and beautiful, with the colors red and blue having a particularly important meaning for understanding the film. the film has some intense nude and sex scenes, and a very slow pace that is intentional. the settings are also very important: sometimes, the arrangement of props and the way the actors relate to them helps us to understand what we see, but this is really subtle, and you have to be attentive. finally, a very special word for the hypnotic and almost unforgettable soundtrack, signed by angelo badalamenti, which is worth listening to, from the main leitmotif to the songs, happy and carefree, in the style of the 50s.",high

212,"always a pleasure to revisit this. <em>'monsters, inc.'</em> is one of my favourite disney animated films.

217,"***bigger is not always better; here it’s overkill***

i'm a fan of the first movie from 1999 and was naturally looking forward to this 2001 sequel. i originally saw it at the theater with two friends; after about 10-15 minutes we were all bored by the bombardment of action and f/x. we just laid back in our seats in tedium for the remaining couple hours.

it's a curious thing that too much action and f/x in a film can be boring. it may not seem logical but it's true; and ""the mummy returns"" is exhibit a. i usually give certain movies second and third chances in the hope that my first impression may have been in error, which i’ve done with this one over the years. unfortunately i keep finding myself relatively detached from the story even though there are all kinds of exciting things going on; or, at least, things that should have been exciting.

""the mummy returns"" has a lot going for it: a great cast, locations, costumes, cinematography, f/x, etc. (although some of the cgi is woefully cartoony, like the scorpion king at the close). it has great indiana jones appeal. unfortunately it all adds up to a forgettable piece of cinematic dung. what went wrong? simply put, no substance. ""the mummy returns"" abandons the characters while the plot is utilized as a clothesline for action and f/x sequences.

the flick curiously has so many ingredients right, but it somehow utterly fails to absorb the viewer. it is unadulterated cinematic junk. it should be utilized in filmmaking classes as the quintessential example of style over substance or overkill: having all the right elements, including budget, and yet stupefyingly fumbling the ball.

the film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes (overlong), and was shot in england, morocco, jordan and egypt. 

grade: c-",low
220,"underwhelming watch, probably won't watch again, and can't honestly recommend.

i think my biggest problems with this are that i can't honestly appreciate matthew mcconaughey or bridgette wilson-sampras despite the quality of their acting: it's like a really well made pie in a flavor you don't like.  as much as i like jennifer lopez as an actor, we start on the end of a movie i'd rather see with bree turner, and i feel like i would have rather seen judy greer in the lead, she seems about as italian as jennifer lopez.

i understand when the meet-cute is a life-threatening situation where adrenaline causes chemical confusion, but this is sort of a head injury causes an almost ""love at first sight"" cliche, but mixed with an ""unavailable romance"" cliche.

once we establish that she loves weddings and it's important to her for some reason, it's a lot of him (not) pursuing her because he's getting married, and her trying to be respectful, but honest.

the movie highlights more societal problems for people that can afford big weddings, or, in short, there is more dumb than funny in this.

231,"**_a fine drama/romance combined with great war action_**

""pearl harbor"" (2001) is a titanic-ized version of the tragic events of pearl harbor—a fabricated drama/romance hooking the viewer into the deceitful attack of december 7, 1941.

it's 85 minutes before the attack occurs so the drama/romance and build-up to the infamous day better be good, and it is. it's believable too (except maybe for the premature sex scene, which inaccurately transfers modern morals to the early '40s). this first act successfully brings us back to the era of the early '40s and sets the stage for the attack. i didn't think there would be any action until the big attack but i was wrong, as we get some quality action when rafe (ben affleck) goes over to europe to fly for the british. there are also a couple of fight sequences.

while dancing & drinking, evelyn (kate beckinsale) comments to rafe how shy danny (josh hartnett) seems to be while he’s shown just sitting at a table too shy to talk to a girl or ask someone to dance. rafe responds that danny is like a brother to him, that danny's father abused him, and he therefore lacks confidence. while these characters are fictional, this is real. much later, danny goes to a woman's apartment fumbling & stumbling to ask her out. the conversation is, of course, awkward. he then walks away, speaking under his breath, ""you're such an idiot!"" this is good stuff.

the film also shows that the timid average-looking man can win the heart of a beautiful woman just as well as the confident handsome man. it's simply a matter of passion, patience, risk, humble pie and playing your cards right.

as for the pearl harbor attack, it's a full 30 minutes of great war footage. critics argue that there are many historical inaccuracies in the film, but what? seriously, what is so historically inaccurate in the film? i'm sure there are a few minor inaccuracies (maybe jimmy doolittle's boot laces weren't right, oh, my god!!), but what film with a historical backdrop ever has everything 100% right? the gist of the event is accurate. and the subplot with cuba gooding jr. as navy boxer doris miller is a true story.

the film is also respectful of the japanese viewpoint as they meticulously plan, prepare for, and carry out their massive raid. i felt this was generous on the filmmakers' part since nothing can justify their deceitful and cowardly assault. they spoke with forked tongue of peace while planning the unprovoked aggression. meanwhile there’s a great scene showing the japanese pilots the night before the raid, praying and psyching up for the attack. it's very realistic.

after the attack, i knew there was a good 50 minutes left in the film so i was apprehensive regarding the remainder of the story; not to worry, though, as this final act compellingly details the doolittle raid, the first american bombing mission over japan. more great war action.

this bold mission took place a mere 4.5 months after the pearl harbor attack on april, 1942. the raid is notable in that it was the only time in us military history that bombers were launched from an aircraft carrier. sixteen modified bombers with five-men crews successfully bombed 10 military and industrial targets in and around tokyo. unfortunately, this was a one-way mission and they were forced to fly to mainland china to land, crashland or bail out, if they had enough fuel, that is. most of the americans made it to china and safety with the help of chinese civilians and soldiers, but hey paid dearly for helping as it is estimated that the japanese killed 250,000 chinese, vengefully searching for doolittle's men! incidentally, lt. col. jimmy doolittle is greatly portrayed by alec baldwin and, true to history, the picture shows doolittle taking part in the daring mission. more historical accuracy.

some criticize that the doolittle raid doesn't belong in the movie, but nothing could be further from the truth. if all the flick showed was the pearl harbor attack and the immediate aftermath it would've ended on a real downer. showing the successful doolittle raid makes the film end on a positive note. what effect did the raid have at the time? for one, it caused american moral to soar from the depths. it has the same inspiring effect on viewers.

in light of all the criticism i kept waiting for ""pearl harbor"" to stumble and fail, but it never happened. yes, the viewer has to be open to the drama/romance as it leisurely unfolds, but this just helps make the viewer care about the characters before the tragic events inevitably occur. i'm not a fan of michael bay. i have zero interest in his ""transformers"" films, but this is great filmmaking. it provokes interest in the events and inspires the viewer to research them in more detail.

the pledge is directed by sean penn and adapted to screenplay by jerzy kromolowski and mary olson-kromolowski from friedrich dürrenmatt's novel, ""the promise"". it stars jack nicholson, robin wright penn, aaron eckhart, sam shepard, patricia clarkson, helen mirren, tom noonan, benicio del toro, mickey rourke, dale dickey, vanessa redgrave and harry dean stanton. music is by klaus badelt and hans zimmer, and cinematography by chris menges.

police chief jerry black (nicholson) is literally on his last day before retitement. but during his leaving party news filters through that a young girl has been brutally murdered. talking his chiefs into letting him tag along to the crime scene, black ends up breaking the dredful news to the girl's parents. there he pledges to the mother that he will find her daughter's killer.

dürrenmatt's source material has been mined a few times for other filmic ventures, where the best of the other bunch is ""es geschah am hellichten tag"" (""it happened in broad daylight""). it is here, though, in sean penn's hands, that we get the version that got two thumbs up from the author, mostly because of the ending staying true to his work.

it should be noted from the off that this is not police procedural detective piece. this is a slow burn, moody and edgy picture, the kind that penn excells at as an actor. thankfully, in spite of it losing money at the box office, it shows penn the perfect director for such material.

it obviously isn't a film for everyone, more so if not prepared for it being a picture about one man's tumbling emotional descent. as jerry black searches for the perpretrator of heinious crimes, he also is faced with a moral judgement call and a major affair of the heart.

the trick of the screnplay here is not in the red herrings and the little dangles of clues that appear to be on offer to jerry, it's that we are never quite sure if jerry is actually right in his belief of a child serial killer at work. is it the product of a man so driven by the pledge he made, that he isn't thinking straight? or worse losing his grip on sanity? the answer will only will out with the clinically daring finale. 

lead actors nicholson and wright penn turn in some of their finest work, both responding to sean's probing of troubled souls in search of an exit. there's an array of quality support actors in small parts, which is a testament to the pull that working with penn did appeal. the musical score is nervy and sits smartly with the ethereal tones that menges brings via his photographic lenses.

the pledge is a haunting and disturbing character study that refuses to cop out. it achieves its aims and wasn't going to pander to any crowd pleasing bums on seats tactics. a dark thriller for grown ups who have the patience for such a telling, and perhaps more crucially are prepared to have their emotions tested with the finale. 9/10",high
258,"i got two words for you, mini-bar.

literally fresh out of prison, danny ocean is busy setting up a seemingly impossible robbery. the plan, along with ten other experts he has roped in, is to rob the main vault at las vegas that houses the takings from the three main casinos.

the original ocean's 11 released in 1960 is an ok film, more watchable for the vegas setting and the irrepressible cast of rat packers than for any purpose or structure. that this steven soderbergh remake trumps the original in every department is a triumph of entertainment values over pure star appeal. some would put a case up for the cast of soderberg's film using stars to entice the audience in? but really at the time of release it was a stretch to put george clooney, brad pitt and matt damon (all excellent here) on the same pedal stool as frank sinatra, sammy davis jr. and dean martin.

the most striking thing about this remake is that the whole cast seem to be enjoying themselves, mainly because they are not being asked to over exert their performances from their very astute director, they really are just asked to turn up, enjoy each other's company and deliver one of the coolest pictures to have been made in the decade.

the film is purely out there to entertain, it has geniality pouring out from every frame, this is a character based heist caper full of laughs and derring do shenanigans - even don cheadle's ill advised (and pointless character arc) cockney accent manages to create smiles instead of being an on going hindrance. some critics said the film is far too shallow to have any real worth! what the hell do they want? so the crooks are nice guys, it's a refreshing change to see a vegas sparkling bright without any seedy undercurrents, where these robbers aren't using ak 47s to obliterate the opposition, it's wits and dashes of cool that fills out their respective armouries.

the soundtrack and scoring are themselves cool characters in the piece, whilst a big shout out goes to the bona fide stunt work from the wonderfully elastic shaobo qin - which merely puts another cherry on this already delightful cake. all the cast (too many to mention) are great, from andy garcia's suave and mean boss, terry benedict, to julia roberts' (walking like a goddess) tess ocean, all things in the film deliver a feel good movie that when all put together, and all things considered, is a film made by lovers of the medium for, well yes, lovers of the medium itself! 9/10",high

session 9 is directed by brad anderson who also co-writes the screenplay with stephen gevedon. it stars peter mullan, david caruso, josh lucas, brendan sexton iii and stephen gevedon. music is scored by climax golden twins and cinematography is by uta briesewitz.

danvers state hospital (aka: state lunatic hospital at danvers, the danvers lunatic asylum, and the danvers state insane asylum), massachusetts. built in 1874, opened in 1878 and closed in 1992. the home to misery, madness, tragedies and troubling treatments. five men from an asbestos removal company, each with issues or points to prove, enter the vast bat shaped structure under the promise of a big pay off to get the job done in one week. but over the course of the week money will be the last thing on their minds.

psychological horror at its finest, session 9, in the hands of brad anderson, pretty much gets everything right in this most skin itching of sub-genres. like the ghost story splinter of horror, setting is absolutely everything, and few, if any? horror settings are as imposing or eerie as the one time danvers state hospital. sadly demolished in 2006/7 to make way for an apartment complex (bastard property developers have no respect outside of the purse), the place positively oozes unease throughout the movie. with anderson choosing to shoot his film on videotape, this further aids the sense of realism and palpable dread, and although it isn't a stretch of the mind to think about some of the misery that played out in reality at danvers, anderson and his photographer briesewitz ensure that it never leaves our conscious. tone is set from the off as being slow burn, this is perfect as it allows us to get a grasp of the characters, their psychological make ups and narrative worth.

with the danvers facility proving to be the extra character, all things come together seamlessly to gnaw away at the viewers. it's a devilishly odd thing to say, but as the story and characters are given room to breath, the audience who have immersed themselves in the picture will start to feel claustrophobic, and then for the night time sequences, even achluophobic. it's pitch perfect pacing by anderson, who prior to unleashing the unnerving finale, has pulled us (and his excellent cast) slowly through a labyrinth of dank corridors, wards, treatment rooms, caged stairwells and a morgue. even on the outside during daylight hours everything feels bleak, either with characters loomed over by the building, or on a roof chatting while gothic turrets watch over them menacingly, the ghosts and bitterness of danvers hospital exist fully in anderson's movie.

story links a tape recording found by mike (gevedon) with that of the workers' unfolding plight. the tape tells of 9 sessions with a troubled patient named mary hobbes, to say anymore would be spoilerish, but for the record in this writers eyes it's the creepiest tape recording in horrorville. add in the odd hospital prop such as a lone wheelchair, a hydrotherapy bath or an orbitoclast! well you get the picture i'm sure. climax golden twins provide a suitably jarring score, where disjointed noises and elongated tonal strains further enhance the pervading disquiet. picture only falls down slightly with silly plot error involving a furnace, and for some folk the ending will inevitably be met with dissatisfaction. i liked it plenty but i also feel they could have gone another way with it. but it does work well and isn't a cop out, and certainly it's better than the alternate ending available in the extras section of home disc formats.

305,"at a relatively modest 106 minutes the man from elysian fields is still a little too long – and yet i can see why director george hickenlooper would hesitate to edit out the scenes where mick jagger shares screen time with anjelica huston. 

these scenes add nothing and lead nowhere, but darn it, they have mick jagger and anjelica huston in them. the problem is that the jagger character is little more than a narrator, and should exist only to introduce andy garcía into the world of male escorting; whatever he does in his spare time, and with whom he does it, has no bearing whatsoever on the plot and is therefore of zero interest to the audience.

anyway, luckily for andy, though rather unbelievably in general, his experience as a glorified gigolo involves one single solitary customer who, as expected, is rich and lonely, but also very beautiful and about his same age, and to cap it all, married to his hero, played by james coburn, who not only is quite at peace with his wife procuring herself a sexual surrogate, but also willing to let garcía help him rewrite his next novel. uh huh.

improbabilities aside, the whole triangle business is the best part of the movie (with coburn effortlessly evoking a rugged, hemingway-esque manliness), and its potential for both dramatic and comedic material renders garcía’s previously established domestic life disposable were it not that the script needs it to provide the sappy happy ending (and that hickenlooper couldn’t bear to part even with julianna margulies goes a long way in explaining his attachment to jagger and huston).

the time devoted to either sub-plot would have been better spent monitoring garcia's progress as a writer. no doubt his bittersweet experiences with coburn and the latter's wife would provide him with much better material (not to mention a solid tree to lean against, in terms of professional learning) than his previous novel, a sub-ira levin thriller called hitler's child; however, the characters are authors only nominally, and the extent of their literary collaboration is reduced to substituting one ""microcosm"" for another (migrant workers instead of roman slaves).",low

337,"

the collective fever that characterized the countdown to the phantom menace had long since dissipated by the time the first sequel prequel rolled off the ilm production line. casual spectators, once stung, had decamped en masse to the newly discovered middle-earth, leaving george lucas with just the few million hardcore fans - true believers who, with all the apprehension of parents at a nativity play, willed their defrocked hero back towards respectability.

there are certainly stretches in the patchy attack of the clones when lucas’ flat-packed dialogue struggles to keep the hecklers quiet – anakin’s seduction of the former queen has all the charm of a teenage lunge behind the bike-sheds and none of the feeling – but by the time climactic ‘reel six’ cranks into high gear the saga’s reputation as the godfather of modern sci-fi spectacle is more or less restored. indeed, when yoda finally unsheathes his mini-saber and kicks sith ass the faithful can reliably be found standing on seats hollering as if the outcome was never in doubt. but, as the little jedi might say, in doubt it was.

where episode v fairly zipped around the galaxy with all the breezy confidence of youth, unafraid to travel anywhere, even dark places, the second middle child of the saga is saddled with an altogether heavier burden from which it struggles to escape. empire hits the ground running on ice planet hoth, clones however, has a truly cold start to contend with, aware perhaps that the movie’s most pressing task is to simply atone for the more egregious sins of episode i. thus, jar jar is quickly sidelined, the upgraded cgi yoda gets a showcase and those damn amidala-clones are killed off on page one. on coruscant we also meet the grown-up ‘ani’ - okay so he’s a whiny teenager but that’s still a vast improvement on the bowl-haired moppet the world was asked to root for in 1999.

also more powerful than when last we met is ewan mcgregor’s obi-wan, the jedi who was simply wan in menace is a much more forceful presence as a full-bearded master, struggling manfully with the endless exposition and even landing the odd punchline.

as with empire, the protagonists are separated for the second act: while obi-wan is busy uncovering the conspiracy of the clones, anakin and padme turn into colourless clones of han and leia in the romance stakes. there are pleasures (obi-wan squares off against jango fett) and pitfalls (anakin and padme have a picnic) in roughly equal measure throughout this flabby middle act but as with episode i mostly you get a sense of drama that is willed into being, a necessary bridge to episode iii that requires lucas to traverse territory – romance, politics – he is simply not comfortable in.

matters improve greatly in the final forty minutes: christopher lee’s count dooku arrives to provide some much needed gravitas, c-3po turns up to do his c-3po thing and padme puts on a skin-tight white leotard. best of all, lucas finally cuts loose. the classic trilogy bristled with seat-of-your-pants filmmaking, our heroes bouncing from cliffhanger to cliffhanger, and in the final section of episode ii – almost four hours into this prequel enterprise - lucas at last cranks up to this saturday morning serial pace: from the tex avery goofiness of the droid factory, to the cecil b. de mille grandeur of the gladiator arena, the action never lets up.

also in the last reel we finally get to divine something of lucas’ grand design, with ironic pay-offs for the fans still paying close attention - it is the witless jar jar who makes the creation of a clone army possible and yoda who first leads what will become stormtroopers into battle. in its own way, the end of episode ii is every bit as dark as the famous end of episode v.

unsurprisingly, the least anticipated movie of the saga suffered at the box office – episode iv raked in more money at the us box office back in 1977 – and remains largely unloved by the fanbase for its emphasis on the central love story but despite no real improvement in dialogue or acting it functions perfectly well as an old fashioned romantic epic, complete with standalone set-pieces, rich political intrigue and a painters’ pallette. indeed, so indebted is lucas to david o. selznick here, ultimately he may have been better served abandoning his own trilogy structure and boiling both episodes i and ii down to a 3-hour gone with the wind style classic – an approach that would have at least halved all that damn anticipation.


verdict - the middle episode that can make a virtue of its bridging role is rare indeed. and where the empire strikes back dazzled with vertiginous cliffhangers, clones is more typical of the breed, necessary but not vital. however, as we make the awkward journey through anakin’s teenage trials a sparkling digital print ensures there is still much to marvel at, not least a little green fella who is surprisingly quick on the draw.

rewatching before obi-wan kenobi.

i don't know if i dislike the phantom menace more or attack of the clones less, but i didn't feel the (endless) problems of episode ii as much as i - jar jar being left aside helps tremendously, thank god. still, the issues are so many that i can't fit them in a single paragraph.

the dialogue is even worse in this one, mostly due to the cringeworthy romantic storyline between anakin and padmé. some of the worst writing the big screen has ever witnessed. i'm usually quite defensive of acting performances, but christensen is truly, deeply terrible here.

there are more lightsaber fights, but none come even close to maul's sequence in tpm. once again, the overreliance on cgi elements/characters doesn't help the action set pieces, despite the visuals overall improvement. the score makes most scenes ""look"" better than they are.

the screenplay is packed with logical inconsistencies, but it's the poor treatment of the all-powerful, wise jedi that disappoints me. from their lack of awareness to the made-up, nonsensical rules about their ideology, i really don't know what lucas had on his mind.

finally, the editing yet again. attack of the clones is longer than it should. captivating, important sequences are cut too short, while dull, exposition-heavy scenes are carried on for too long. there's a good movie in here somewhere. i just can't find it. however...

its positives somehow land better this time around. i find most of the action pretty solid. anakin rescuing his mother is arguably one of the best scenes of the prequels. and again, less jar jar. i genuinely think it switches with the phantom menace ... at the bottom of my ranking, though.

342,"unequivocally, unmistakably, undeniably disney's greatest animated film. a masterpiece, as far as i'm concerned. long read ahead!

film and reviews are all about opinions, which is only a positive thing. i, for one, though have yet to find a better animation than this. no doubt i'm probably partly clouded by nostalgia, but even a tonne of years later i still remember how blown away i was when i first watched it. nothing's changed.

where to start? i love every single detail about this film, for which there are many. not only does it improve upon the studio's earlier 1950 production about robert louis stevenson's 1883 novel, but it manages to create an incredibly touching, amusing and rather thrilling story for all. they don't rely on the usual, overdone disney front and center romance to do it either.

it's a story of a young kid coming-of-age into the world. you really go on a journey with jim hawkins, who hadn't had the most happiest childhood. we see him grow into a man across just 95 short minutes. joseph gordon-levitt brings jim to life superbly, no surprise to see he has done other great things in his career.

gordon-levitt isn't the only outstanding performer here, with brian murray and emma thompson showing their talents in the roles of john silver and capt. amelia. i adore the dynamic between silver and hawkins, murray is truly brilliant. thompson is great in her role, also.

even below those aforementioned names, you have memorable characters in delbert (david hyde pierce), b.e.n. (martin short) and mr. arrow (roscoe lee browne). morph (dane davis) is a cracking little sidekick, too.

away from the cast, you also have the sensational animation. they mix hand-drawn 2d and computer generated 3d, which comes out exquisitely. sure some of it hasn't aged impeccably compared to now, but it all to this day still looks utterly stunning. i love the attention to detail.

that's not all. how about that music? i couldn't tell you the amount of times i've listened to that soundtrack down the years, it's so beautifully crafted by james newton howard and john rzeznik; the latter's, as part of the goo goo dolls, ""i'm still here"" fits so, so well.

can you tell how much fondness i hold for this? it's fantastic! did disney mishandle it? sure. does it deserves more respect? definitely. however, i'm kinda glad they just let ron clements and john musker do their thing. heavy disney interference could've ruined it. the fact this has zero pointless sequels is marvellous, even if it's for the wrong reasons.

there are minor rumours they plan to live-action this. normally i'd argue against classics being remade, but i think this 2002 production is in a win-win position in that regard. if it's a big success it'll be good for it, if it's terrible then it'll put more eyes on the original.

it's kinda funny, i don't see myself as a disney fan and yet my two favourites films (this + <em>'pirates of the caribbean: the curse of the black pearl'</em>) are from this studio - and both pirate-y, interestingly. hmm.

384,"peter jackson has always maintained that the two towers is ""the second act"" of his epic undertaking, and perhaps the true greatness of the middle chapter will only be clear when viewed in context. as a stand-alone film, however, the two towers is not quite as good as fellowship. (nor, indeed, does it extend the universe or deepen the relationships in the manner of the empire strikes back.) that it still merits the full five stars is merely an indication of how high the benchmark has been set.

picking up pretty much where fellowship left off, this is a considerably darker film, with frodo (wood) falling further under the influence of the ring (giving rise to some seriously spooky hallucinations), while saruman (christopher lee) wreaks even more havoc. there's also the first appearance of saruman's spy, the sinister wormtongue (brad dourif), and the complex gollum, a brilliant combination of computer trickery and raspy vocals from andy serkis (the campaign for a best supporting actor oscar starts here).

other newcomers include faramir (david wenham), the understandably miffed brother of the recently deceased boromir, and éowyn (miranda otto), who spends much of her time casting winsome glances in the general direction of aragorn (mortensen). eventually the plot complexities become more coherent, setting the action up for the forthcoming finale, the return of the king.

as we've come to expect, this is spectacular stuff - from an opening which sees frodo troubled by dreams about the demise of gandalf, through to the climactic battle of helm's deep, which is nothing short of breathtaking. but jackson cleverly tempers the louder, brasher sequences with some heartstring-tugging moments - peasants despondent as they are forced to abandon their villages, aragorn and arwen's troubled relationship, and, of course, the return of gandalf (sir ian mckellen, superb as ever), one of the film's most powerful, memorable images that may well leave ring devotees a little misty-eyed.

however, those who still believe that the trilogy is beyond criticism may find their views challenged by the two towers. it's just as long as the first film, but gets the heroes no closer to a final victory. and, where the first movie developed its emotional tone from the brightness of the shire to a darker climax, the sequel is more of a one-note affair, shadowy in both look and content.

this is particularly true of the ringbearer's quest, which adds the not-insignifcant gollum to the party, but suffers more than the other story strands from the cross-cutting and finishes with a nearly identical pep talk from sam to the tearful speech that climaxed fellowship. of course, given the nature of the material, and jackson's desire to be faithful, this is all understandable. and by the time we all end up under siege at helm's deep, it's unlikely anyone will give a toss about narrative arcs: like gollum, this is simply gob-smacking, mind-blowing, never-seen-before stuff.


verdict - it may lack the first-view-thrill and natural dramatic shape of fellowship, but this is both funnier and darker than the first film, and certainly more action-packed. an essential component of what is now destined to be among the best film franchises of all time.

there are, though, a few bits i found less great - still very good in the grand overall scheme, but just comparably with the 2001 release. i found the pacing to be slightly off in moments, while a few of the new cast members didn't connect to me - e.g. bernard hill. the side story, meanwhile, with billy boyd and dominic monaghan didn't interest me at all... they spend too much of the run time just walking through a forest.

elijah wood remains good though. i did enjoy seeing the journey of frodo and sam (sean astin). andy serkis also gets more screen time with that aforementioned duo as gollum, which is most definitely only a major positive - a fun character! any scene with those three = outstanding.

391,"spielberg does tech-noir!

the year is 2054 and the murder rate in washington is zero, the reason? three pre-cognitives (each named after a literary great) whose combined abilities witness murders before they actually occur. apparently faultless, it's then something of a surprise to pre-crime chief john anderton (tom cruise) when the pre-cogs predict he is to murder a man named leo crow. forced to go on the run, and haunted by a family tragedy, anderton must evade the system he so perfectly executed himself. can he find a flaw? or is he actually about to commit a murder?

everybody runs! that was the tag line that accompanied the explosive trailer for steven spielberg's, tom cruise starrer, minority report. this marketing tool indicated that the great bearded one had adapted from the phillip k dick short story and created an action monster? he hadn't, he had in fact created something far far better than popcorn fodder.

minority report was the next project for spielberg following the equally dark and intriguing ai: artificial intelligence, both films serving to note that spielberg was capable of thought provoking science fiction outside of the standard crowd pleasers that many critics love to decry. in fact, it's arguable that spielberg may have hit his creative peak with minority report, for the messages and crawling dystopian bleakness on show paint a picture not so much as a future far away in our lives, but of one we live in now. big thematic points of reference dot themselves throughout the piece. such as the changing of eye balls, or that in these post 9/11 years we yearn, and always will, to be safer.

here in this bleached shadowy world, a world of metallic tones and visual stings (ace cinematographer janusz kaminski on duty), we are safe under pre-crime. yet still it's a world without soul, it has no heart, it's almost as if inhuman in itself, suggesting that the world's problems are not easily vanquished by technology - a total sacrifice of the world's inhabitant's souls. spielberg of course is well served by the supreme professionals he has at his disposal, he has also managed to garner a great performance from tom cruise, something that critic and fan favourite directors have not managed to do previously. believable grief, action work as strong as ever, it is however with his ability to imbue a tortured film noir protagonist where cruise excels the most.

alongside cruise and operating with great impact are samantha morton as pre-cog agatha and max von sydow, the latter adding that touch of experienced know how needed for his particularly important character. the odd casting choice appeared to be colin farrell as the meddling, almost vindictive danny witwer, but he plays well off of cruise, this even if he veers dangerously close to comic book villainy at times (check out a holy smoke batman scene). what action there is is first rate, from a jet back pack pursuit, to car jumping heroics, the sequences are crafted with spielberg's deft eye for an action sequence. while the sick sticks (yes you read right) metal spiders and a brilliant peter stormare cameo should hopefully have you squirming and grinning in equal measure.

which brings us to the finale, an ending that may not be a complete surprise (yet it still doesn't cop-out in context to anderton's tragedy), but things are rounded off in true classic noir tradition, where it closes down a thinking man's tech-noir. superb. 9/10",high

and this brings me to the point in the review where i question why i know what the difference between an ascot and a puff are.

anyway, self-reflection aside, the problem is that it doesn't know if it wants to be a thrilling adventure novel that is best epitomized by the writings of dumas in all his pulp adventure glory... or if the story lasted in popularity for a century or so too long and now has to be regarded as a drama and treated with all the seriousness of a mature literary classic.

it teases with both and never settles on either. it kind of comes across that wolpert, the writer, understood that dumas was a pulp adventure writer but reynolds, the director, thought dumas was as serious as dante.

458,"***haunting mystery with supernatural elements – reverent, beautiful, brilliant***

released in 2002 and directed by mark pellington, ""the mothman prophecies"" details some of the strange events that occurred in point pleasant, west virginia, from november 15, 1966, to december 15, 1967 (13 months). the movie, however, transplants the events to the year 2001.

plot: richard gere plays john klein, a journalist for the washington post trying to come to grips with the sudden death of his wife, mary (debra messing). he mysteriously shows up in point pleasant, west virginia, where he develops a relationship with the sympathetic police sergeant, connie (laura linney). many of the town's residents have sighted an eerie mothman-like entity, similar to the one mary saw before she died. a researcher (alan bates) believes that the ‘mothmen’ exist on a sphere beyond human comprehension and that they can foresee impending calamities. is the ‘mothman’ sighted in point pleasant warning the citizens of one? if so, what is it?

this is not a monster movie or a slasher horror flick; if you want that see “mothman” (2010), which is actually pretty good for a tv creature feature (and interestingly links the mothman to the unjust slaying of cornstalk, aka hokoleskwa, in 1777). “the mothman prophecies,” by contrast, is a supernatural/mystery story with cogent creepy mood. every element skillfully works: acting, story, editing, score, cinematography, locations, effects, etc. underneath the film’s eeriness there’s an undeniable reverent, beautiful quality while the ending is strangely touching.

one critic claimed that the mysteries presented in the story are not supposed to be figured out and, indeed, cannot be figured out. but this is untrue. the film is intricate and respects the intelligence of the viewer. questions are raised with varying possibilities. the answers are there, but you may have to watch it a few times to discover them. i appreciate the fact that the director and writer refused to spell everything out for the viewer, even allowing room for complete misinterpretation. if the viewer wants answers s/he must have ""ears to hear"" and be willing to work for them.

my initial interpretation was that the ‘mothmen’ are good spiritual beings that are trying to help humanity by predicting great calamities but can be misunderstood because they are so far superior to humans. in a nutshell, my interpretation was that the mothman somehow brought klein to point pleasant to meet and save the future replacement for his dead wife, who died due to a pre-existing condition that only the mothman knew about. this explanation obviously suggests that the mothmen are good in nature.

i've come to see that this interpretation is false; a brilliantly implemented red herring.

bottom line: ""the mothman prophecies"" is a rare film that’s genuinely intriguing and filled with gems to mine, even if you’ve already seen it several times. it’s so artistic that it’s a pleasure to behold over and over.

the film runs 1 hour, 59 minutes and was shot in kittanning, pennsylvania (substituting for point pleasant), pittsburgh (the factory and city scenes, etc.) and other western pa towns. writers: richard hatem wrote the screenplay from john keel’s book.

insights about the mothmen *** spoiler alert *** (don’t read until you view the movie).

the ‘mothmen’ are evil spirits or fallen angels (they're synonymous). this is clear when viewing eye-witness drawings of the creatures, which never show beautiful angel-like beings, but rather dark disturbing, obviously-malevolent winged-creatures. it’s the same thing with the actual appearances of the creature (freeze frame the images).

a mothman caused the auto accident that injured debra messing. would a good angelic being cause such a tragedy (regardless of the fact that she ultimately dies of a pre-existing problem)?

the bible calls satan the ""prince of the power of the air;"" hence, his filthy underlings (demons) are spiritual and electro-magnetic in nature. they can thus speak through a phone that's not plugged in or perhaps manipulate a traffic light. they can mimic the voices of dead loved ones or even take human form, like indrid cold, mary or the male nurse who insists that mary's drawings are of ""angels"" and then mysteriously vanishes.

the researcher from chicago reveals that the mothmen are from “hell” (the spiritual underworld that underpins the earth) and send out mixed messages to ruin people’s lives. they may seem to be benevolently warning humans but, at the same time, are obvious instigators of human suffering (the car crash, gordon's job loss, insanity & ultimate demise and the researcher's loss of his family, career & respectable social life). also, they refuse to reveal their true selves and intentions. they are highly skilled masqueraders.

the reclusive researcher also points out that they have been around for millennia and therefore see things 2-3 moves ahead of humans; they use this vantage point to manipulate, deceive and destroy. since their m.o. is to “kill, steal and destroy,” they feed on death, destruction and torment and therefore venture to the places where great tragedies will transpire, like the silver bridge collapse.

the saved police woman at the end was number ""37,” historically a numerical symbol of the christ, which shows that her submersion in the river and figurative resurrection is a type of the anointed one. yet she is still a victim in that her previous views that the mothmen are destructive and manipulative could now flip-flop into the deception that they are somehow agents of good. of course we never find out if this happens because the tale potently ends with klein and connie in shock sitting in an ambulance just glad to be alive.

the film powerfully illustrates that humanity is caught in a cosmic war and that there are malevolent beings who purpose to ruin or destroy us. failure to understand and tactically prepare can be fatal or lead to great suffering. the only true protection from these evil spiritual beings is reconciliation with the creator through jesus christ's blood shield of atonement and utilizing the armor of light.",high
459,"a cracking sports drama about the career of jim morris.

absolutely loved this, the 127 minute run time flew by real quick; thoroughly enjoyable. it portrays, with extra drama i'm sure, the events of morris' real life baseball career in a fantastic way. there's great character development right from the get-go, by the conclusion i was utterly invested in morris. he is played by dennis quaid, who is superb in the role. i felt every emotion of his character, best i've (currently) seen of quaid so far.

the film does a great job at making you care for not only him, but even his high school team. speaking of which, they did a terrific job with the casting of those guys - i felt like i was watching a bunch of real teammates; chad lindberg, of <em>'the fast and the furious'</em>, is one of them. even away from quaid and lindberg & co., you still have morris' family to feel for as well. there's many characters to get attached to, but i was very interested in all of them.

467,"i don't know how to approach this one.

""the time machine"" is one of those stories that, rereading it, beings back vivid memories. one of my best friends in high school loaned it to me, i stored it away in my backpack for about a month and then...when we had a field trip to the board of trade, i scrounged it out and read it on the train ride.

it was one of those stories that is so short i could rip through it in the hour and fifteen minutes between our small town and chicago. to this day, every time i go back to it, it brings me back to 1997 and, to this day, i distinctly remember finishing it about the time the train stopped and i remember walking into the crowded city feeling like i was in a different world. the story had moved me out of reality so much chicago seemed jarring.

and then they made it into a movie, a remake of a movie and, watching it, i don't know, i didn't have that same sense of being in a totally different world that the book gave me...

and the movie, in my mind, has to live up to that experience in some small way. or at least give you that feeling that same feeling that the world was still spinning that one gets when they walk out of a movie and discover that it had rained.

it's an engrossing story and the time machine didn't seem to whisk me away like the book did. i can't help but feel it deserved better.

it felt like i was watching a movie and, honestly, it gave me the same since that jackson's king kong did, it felt like it was trying and horribly, miserably failed.

i left feeling ""meh,"" and that was after being excited walking into it, i mean, i read it in 1997 and they made a movie in 2002 and, i was expecting the same feeling. i had waited long enough.

so, i don't know, i may be overly harsh on it just because i loved what the story did to me so much, the first time i read it and now, as an adult, it doesn't take me to another world, it takes me back to 1997 again, and high school, and that hour fifteen minute train ride to chicago.

so ultimately, it could be a halfway decent film that i just hate because the story had such a jarring effect on me when i first encountered it.",low

477,"wow, that was an excruciating watch.

from literally the first few seconds you know where <em>'the country bears'</em> is going, both with the plot but also with the concept of the bears themselves. that's if you didn't already guess from the poster.

as always i try to find the positive parts: ... ... yeah. if i was forced to pick something, it would be one or two of the songs which are not horrid; there's also a notable cameo from an english musician, i guess that's one? as you can tell, it's not good at all.

on the contrary, where to start with the negatives?! the bears. having people in costumes is always a bad idea, it cheapens everything else around it. they have little or no emotion, so it's impossible to feel attached to the characters. the dub-like audio for them, and other parts of film, is very poor.

no-one stands out in the cast, with the exception of christopher walken (reed) - but that's only because of walken's fame, not his role in this. the premise is so predictable and lazy, they don't even attempt to throw you off the scent - instead trying to force a heartwarming story, which doesn't land whatsoever.

486,"a good cop can't sleep because he's missing a piece  of the puzzle. and a bad cop cant sleep because his conscience wont let him.

insomnia is directed by christopher nolan and written by erik skjoldbjærg and nikolaj frobenius (1997 screenplay). it stars al pacino, robin williams, hilary swank, maura tierney, martin donovan and nicky katt. music is scored by david julyan and cinematography by wally pfister. it's a remake of a 1997 norwegian film of the same name.

lapd detective will dormer (pacino) and his partner hap eckhart (donovan) travel to the remote alaskan town of nightmute to aid the local cops investigating the savage murder of a teenage girl. but dormer leaves behind an internal affairs investigation that gnaws away at him, and when a potential bust of the murder suspect goes tragically wrong, his conscious gets attacked on two fronts. by lack of sleep and by the killer himself.

it's a house of cards.

viewing from afar it's easy to be cynical and suggest that insomnia is just an american remake cash in. bigger budget, bigger stars and directed by an indie darling of the critics moving into the big league. while on the surface the plot looks to be another in a long line of cops and villains thrillers where procedural unfolds and evil is ultimately brought down at the end. yet insomnia is so much more than that, it's a deep movie dealing in complex psychological issues, a blanc-noir of some character substance, a picture clinically put together around one mans descent into a private hell, with the beautiful alaskan backdrop perversely claustrophobic and anthony mann like in being at one with will dormer's fragmented state of mind.

killing changes you. you know that.

from the opening moments as we observe a biplane flying over the alaskan glaciers, accompanied by david julyan's nerve tingling score, there's a looming air of disquiet. nolan knows his noir onions, mood is everything and the dense psychological atmosphere is never once breached for the entire movie. much of the picture is dialogue heavy, gratifyingly so, with the hushed conversations between pacino and williams begging the viewer to hang on every word as cop and killer (no spoiler, it's revealed to us early as a necessity) jostle for control of each others soul. what action there is also comes with a side order of otherworldly delights, a chase across floating logs and a stalk through eerie fog being the two particular highlights.

sleep comes at a cost.

with three oscar winners in the cast nolan had some serious quality to direct, that pacino, williams and swank deliver excellence is high praise for the british director. pacino actually gives one of his finest late career performances, utterly compelling as dormer, his haggard face tells of a thousand sorrows, his sleep deprived gait befits a man staring into the abyss. wally pfister's photography is on the money, the blend of snow whites and green tinges sparkle from the vistas and the soft brown hues inside the hotel provide the rare moments of tranquillity available to will dormer. across the board insomnia is a cracker of a movie, a film that goes into the murky depths of the genre to reveal one of the best movies of 2002. 9/10",high
487,"bad watch, won't watch again, and can't recommend unless you're just a huge peter pan fan and a completionist.

this is in that run of unnecessary sequels disney did to make some cheap bucks; it's (clearly) also right after they started in with digital animation.

while they managed to capture peter and the lost boys fairly well, hook and shmee are more like loose cartoony references to their former selves.  jane and wendy seem to have the most detail put into their animation.  the (classic) crocodile was replaced with an octopus (but still includes a suction cup version of tik-toking) by a visual director that barely understood what an octopus was.

now, being that i'm generally opposed to the octopus in general, i happen to know a few things about octopus so giving it snail-like eyes, a beak and teeth, as well as an over-sized tongue broke me a little.  the behaviors were typically way off, to include swimming with it's arms above water (they typically help with the locomotion) and some weird physics when climbing the boat.

also, we've pretty much pinpointed the inspiration for neverland island, which does actually include salt water crocodiles, but as it is in the caribbean, this giant pacific octopus  is completely out of place.

the animation style was also shifting from scene to scene, object to object.  sometimes it is very jarring, a digital cell character atop a cg rendered log, or other times it's a cg rendered background against the digital cell animation of the ship (or vice versa) that really took me out of it as it just looked so unnatural.  i'll site ""titan a.e."" (fox) and ""treasure planet"" (disney) as too different examples where it was blended much more smoothly.

i actually like the premise better: hook kidnap's wendy's daughter, but the movie does so many weird things.  even though the original movie was officially set in the 1950s, wendy grows at least 4-6 years to 18 to have a 12 year old daughter and a (generously) 3 year old boy, but the entire world travels backwards to ww2.  even if we retro the original setting, make wendy....30?, that means the original occurred in 1929 at the latest, as this sequel could occur during 1945 at the latest, and i just did more math than i'm comfortable with to enjoy a movie.

and this bad movie has the audacity to drop like real dilemmas in the middle: obligation to family vs trustworthiness, acceptance of others, and this crazy mechanical suggestion about how the fey of the island work.  does belief of faeries / pixies matter, is it disbelief that actually harms them?

based on iles’ book 24 hours, trapped aspires to be a potent kidnap thriller, an attempt to use the kidnapping of a young girl as some sort of edge of the seat entertainment, sadly it’s poorly constructed and quite frankly ill advised.

a fine cast has assembled for the picture, but nobody distinguishes themselves as they try to make the generic and idiotic material work. on the atmosphere side of the fence things aren’t half bad, there’s a grim and grubby feel to proceedings, but mandoki consistently ruins each passage of promise with cack-handed convolutions, which when the core plot device is a dumb drug set-up, only makes the feeble efforts of making a twisty thriller even more laughable. the crowning glory of the latter being the finale, which is ludicrous. 2/10 with young fanning the only one coming out of it with any credit.",low

494,"a very good movie could be made with wesley snipes, ving rhames, michael rooker, wes studi and peter falk; undisputed is not that movie, and the fault lies not in its stars, but in writer/producer/director walter hill. 

this is unfortunate because the film initially appears to be smarter than the average prison movie. instead of the usual force prized fights/involuntary battles to the death wherein a condemned contestant goes through a tournament arc in order to win his freedom, we get a state-sanctioned, inter-prison boxing program.

sadly, undisputed manages to avoid all the above-mentioned clichés only to succumb to the the thunderdome. in lieu of a ring with ropes, the bouts take place in a big-ass, roofless cage with barbed wire atop its walls — but why? why go to the trouble of establishing the lawfulness of the premise only to make the actual thing look like a texas death match?

anyway, disgraced heavyweight champion george 'the iceman' chambers (rhames) is convicted of rape, sentenced to 6-8 years, and sent to sweetwater maximum security prison in california. chambers asks his cellmate mingo (studi) why he’s there. mingo replies that «it's not considered polite to ask why we're here. kinda violation of the ethics. you know, the code?»

no, i don’t know. what code? i’d seriously like to know, because it would mean that every prison movie where a character asks another character what he’s in there for (i.e., all of them) is in breach of some sort of tacit etiquette system.

mingo’s right, though; no need to ask when hill helpfully includes captions detailing the lives and crimes of every single characters — even those who only appear in a couple of scenes. why exactly do we need to know that the announcer/commentator is a con artist convicted of larceny in 1995 named marvin?

mendy ripstein (falk), an elderly mobster/boxing fan, becomes dead set on booking a fight between chambers and sweetwater’s own state champion monroe hutchens (snipes), so that he can (according to all movie) ""pull in a million dollars in bets from guards and inmates"" (the movie actually speaks of multiple millions of dollars; either way, that’s a lot of cigarettes). 

chuy (jon seda), ripstein's caretaker or something, says “i talked to the head guard [rooker]. he’s ok agrees. but the warden [dennis arndt] is a problem.” the nature of this problem seems to be that the warden can’t make up his goddamn mind; first he allows the fight, as long as it happens while he’s on vacation. 

he then backtracks and cancels it. finally, he backpedals yet again and agrees to it. he’s not the only indecisive one, however; at first ripstein wants a bare knuckle fight, but then someone complains, ripstein thinks it over for about five seconds, and decides that it’s better with gloves — so why bring it up at all. 

i understand why they cast falk in this role, but they needn’t have bothered him for something that burt young could have easily handled. as for rooker and studi, hill forgot to write parts for them to play — which is odd considering that rooker as a sadistic, racist guard c.o and studi a mystical mentor are parts that pretty much write themselves (and even such clichés, that both actors are more than able to elevate beyond the commonplace, would be better than nothing).

that leaves snipes, who does with his zen warrior what he can (not much, since he spends a good chunk of the movie in solitary confinement), and rhames, who has the juiciest character and makes the most of it, as a man torn between the need to be a ""model prisoner"" if he wants to regain his freedom and resume his career before it’s too late, and his pathological desire to be respected and feared at all costs, something he only knows to achieve through physical violence. 

unfortunately, the ugly business of rape remains unaccountably ambiguous. chambers is unequivocally the antagonist, and rhames is so good at being bad that it's hard to believe his claims of innocence. 

therefore, either chambers is innocent in that particular respect but a horrible human being in general, or he's guilty and ultimately gets away with it, since in exchange for fighting monroe, ripstein uses his clout to get chambers out ""in special parole” (one has to wonder why ripstein, who can get someone paroled without having served the minimum time required, doesn't use his obviously vast influence to his own advantage). 

we are supposed to believe that the humiliation of being beaten by monroe is punishment enough; chuy narrates at the end that “the iceman and his manager denied that the fight with monroe ever happened and the story that he lost was just a big rumour” — and why wouldn’t they? it is, after all,  their word against that of 700 witnesses between inmates and prison staff, not to mention, as marvin points out, “our friends from las vegas, here to witness this competition and report to various cities across our great country. a lot of bookmakers want to know what's coming."" d'oh!",low

one additional note, the friend of mine who i put this on for told me that the movie was from the era of ""when tara reid was still hot"". now personally i've never found any iteration of her attractive, but it did make me have a parallel thought, is van wilder from the era when tara reid was a better actor? i'm not saying she has been some sort of oscar-worthy great at any stage, but if i compare her in this to her in, for example, _sharknado 47_, despite the extra years of experience, she's definitely worse now, right?

28 days later... 

the amazing thing with danny boyles's 28 days later is that although it owes a huge debt to the likes of george romero's zombie films, and john wyndham and richard matheson's writings, it still feels fresh and exciting. film is quintessentially british, as evidenced by the rightly lauded use of a depopulated london for the starting point to the terror, yet there's an earthiness to our small band of survivors. these are flawed characters that are ill equipped to deal with the infected implosion, there's nothing remotely hollywood about these people or the landscapes that frame them (cg is minimal, where hand-held digital cameras are the order of the day). 

there's a realistic feel factor that is rarely seen in other films of this ilk. yep, sure there's implausibilities, but with the infected creatures running at a fair old clip, becoming scary creations in a stark stripped back land, there's too much fun being had - and nervous tension being burnt - to even begin to start nit-picking. besides, the last quarter alone is a lesson in energy fuelled horror as the survivors, having seemingly found a safe house, find that monsters aren't merely confined to the infected human kind. it's a cracker-jack of a finale, bloody and bloody frantic, all backed by murphy's simple but totally potent musical arrangements.

it's easy to see why america made it a monster hit at the box office, after just making a small profit in the uk, film went to america and made it big. americans, you have to feel, enjoyed watching something raw in a sub-genre of horror that was at the time reliant on romero rediscovering his mojo. worldwide the film made over $70 million in profit, and those are the kinds of figures that speak volumes. the success ensured a sequel would follow, where boyle and garland bowed out of the main chairs and into producers roles for ""28 weeks later"". it's not as raw as ""days"", but it's gorier and itself also a fine ""infected"" horror movie, and certainly a worthy follow up to what boyle and garland clinically created in 2002.

i can't deny that austin powers was a landmark franchise for late '90s humor cinema, but the truth is that this film, like its immediate predecessor, isn't funny at all. here, the script is based on a new conspiracy by dr. evil, this time in harmony with a dutchman fascinated by gold, who wants all the gold he can hoard. so that the english spy doesn't get in his way, he kidnapped and had powers' father killed.

the script is very weak, has worn-out premises and works, in practice, as a parody of the third film in the bond franchise. if that was any success initially, in this case it doesn't seem like enough for the movie to work. in addition, the conception of the vast majority of characters is unfortunate because it is very underdeveloped, the writing is terrible and the dialogues horrible, and everything seems just an excuse for an avalanche of jokes. also, there are characters here that don't really have to be here, like fat bastard.

mike myers continues to play several characters, in a very intense and truly well-executed role-playing exercise; he tries everything to make his film work, and invests his talent in a truly remarkable way. however, if the recipe no longer works, the actor's effort and talent are simply being wasted. in addition, there are other actors with an equally positive record, such as verne troyer, michael caine or beyoncé. the rest hardly matters, and i prefer not to mention the large amount of unnecessary cameos from a series of artists, models and singers. seeing so many stars appear just for the hell of it doesn't make any sense and gives the film an irritating sense of smugness.

technically, there are some features that i want to point out, namely the visuals and specials, with myers playing opposite himself in many occasions and scenes, and the excellent sets and costumes. unfortunately, the film has a very fast pace and the editing was not very happy, but what is really needed here is some really effective humor, because if the film's formula already seems worn out, the humor of the successive jokes is non-existent.",low

malcolm macdowell does a his great creepy villain vibe, and famke janssen (""golden eye"": xenia onatopp) makes a great spy: i wish she had done more of it.

from rob marshall (""into the woods"") and bill condon (""dreamgirls"") comes this charming satirical stab on celebrity criminals. based on the 1975 stage play and starring renee zellweger, catherine zeta-jones and richard gere.

set in the jazz age of chicago, illinois. ""chicago"" tells the story of two women on murderess row who hope that fame and fortune will keep them out of the gallows. velma kelly (zeta-jones) is a vaudevillian performer who plugs her sister and husband right before a performance. roxie hart (zellweger) is watching the performance while idolizeing velma and hopes one day to be on the stage just like her. convinced that with fred casely's (dominic west) help she will get what she wants.

but, when casely turns out to be an abusive lying womanizer roxie is angered and betrayed. causing her to kill him as revenge, she tries to convince her husband amos (john c. reilly) to take the blame. however, his story does not phase the harrison (colm feore) and roxie is arrested and learns that she could face the death penalty. roxie later meets the corrupt but nurturing jail matron mama morton (queen latifah), who gives her some helpful advice on how to win the court's appeal. roxie later finds herself being a client of the corrupt smooth-talking billy flynn (gere), who is determined to help her win her case.

billy corrupts the press with a story about how roxie killed fred out of self-defense. at the same time she butts heads with velma after the press starts putting her name in the headlines. roxie's fame is almost short-lived until she fakes a pregnancy. now with a swelled head, she fires billy convinced she can win the case on her own. unfortunately, she is forced to take billy back after seeing that another inmate will be executed. at the same time amos starts to wonder about roxie's ""baby."" convinced that it is not his baby he decides to file for divorce. the day of the trial billy turns the court room upside down and is able to convince the jury that roxie is innocent, amos learns that the pregnancy was a ruse and finally leaves her.

now that roxie is free she tries to make her dream come true, but velma explains to her that a one woman act is not what chicago is looking for. roxie rejects the offer because of velma's resentment towards her and the lack of hospitality when they were on murderess row. velma finally convinces her that they don't have to be friends in order to be partners. roxie's dream becomes a reality as she and velma are now the hottest act in chicago.

but one question remains did it really happen or is it all in roxie's head?

554,"_**civil war odyssey**_

a confederate soldier inman (jude law) deserts in late 1864 to return to the mountains of western north carolina and his one true love, ada (nicole kidman). inman experiences many different people, events and obstacles on his long journey while ada has her own problems to deal with: death, grief, the ruthless “home guard,” starvation/poverty, and a house & farm she doesn't know how to run, that is, until the practical ruby (renée zellweger) comes along.

based on the 1997 novel by charles frazier, “cold mountain” (2003) involves two stories that ultimately intertwine and is reminiscent of homer's odyssey. in light of inman's journey home, the film is episodic but, thankfully, never loses its sense of cohesion. the story shows how the war destroyed or corrupted the south on practically every level, not just the soldiers who went off to fight, die, be maimed, desert or suffer defeat, but everyone left behind as well. every person inman meets on his journey is somehow damaged or sullied because of the war.

for example, in the case of the family in the large cabin the husband's friendliness is dubious. all the eligible men have gone to war and those who return are maimed and scarred. is it any wonder that the women are love-starved and try to lose themselves in drunkenness and casual sex? as for a couple scenes of overt sexuality, the book & film are contrasting drunken carnal lust with intimate committed love.these scenes are adult-oriented, so be forewarned. i should add that the “kitchen table woman” is actress melora walters, who played george costanza’s date in “the hamptons” episode of seinfeld. meanwhile natalie portman shows up for another key sequence. 

then there’s the immoral & looney ""reverend"" veasey (philip seymour hoffman), who may tempt some to view the film as “anti-christian,"" but this is a premature judgment in light of the entire story and particularly the ending. not to mention likable, but shakey religionists like veasey exist in real life. 

not everyone can handle ""cold mountain"" because of its hardcore depiction of the horrors of war, madness and immorality, but it's not all death, misery and darkness; these are commendably counterbalanced by the beauty of life, love, loyalty, companionship, poetry and music. “cold mountain” is an all-around well-made motion picture that cuts the fat out of the book for a more effective story.

the film runs 2 hours, 33 minutes, and was shot mostly in the carpathian mountains, romania, but with some scenes done in virginia, south carolina, and north carolina.

555,"and so all good things come to an end. for three years in a row, peter jackson has banished our winter blues with the individual instalments of his tolkien trilogy, effectively shifting the focus of our cinematic excitement from the summer months to the end of the year. but now that his epic has been unveiled in its entirety, what will be the lasting effects of his achievement?

well, grand-scale fantasy filmmaking is back on the menu, laying down the gauntlet to george lucas and star wars episode iii. jackson has also proved that notions of risk and ambition needn't be confined to the low-budget, indie end of the spectrum; nor does california have an exclusive stranglehold on groundbreaking special effects.

and then there's the dvd factor. just as the lord of the rings was upping the stakes in theatres, so too was its dvd release pattern defining what can (and should) be done on disc for major movies.

in particular, the four-disc extended editions seem to have affected the director's thinking as to what he can get away with in his theatrical final cut. hence the public grumbles from christopher lee about the non-appearance of saruman in this final instalment. while it might have been fair to grant lee a curtain call, jackson quite rightly realises that it is sauron, not saruman, whose fiery eye encompasses all the narrative strands of the climax.

the return of the king marks the first time in the series when jackson's roots as a horror filmmaker creep through. as the orcs catapult severed gondorian heads beyond the walls of minas tirith, flesh-rotted ghosts draw swords alongside aragorn and giant spider shelob stalks frodo through dark, web-shrouded tunnels, the film pushes the boundaries of its 12a certificate.

and so it should, because the look and tone must necessarily grow darker as the hobbits near mount doom and mordor's evil hand grips middle-earth ever tighter.

character nuances have been crafted over an unprecedented ten hours-plus of cinematic storytelling: from strider lurking in the shadowy corner to aragorn rallying the troops; from merry and pippin as bumbling fools to stout-hearted, pint-sized warriors. only legolas and gimli seem to have regressed (in screen time at least) to set-piece archer and comedy sidekick respectively. at least andy serkis is rewarded for his gollum voice work with an early flashback that gets his face on screen, as well as warning us that, under the ring's power, smeagol can be as murderous as gollum.

jackson has kept the momentum of the series rolling on and on though the traditionally 'difficult' middle part and 'weak' finale, delivering a climax to the story that's neater and more affecting than what tolkien managed on the printed page. some viewers might feel that the director sprinkles some cheese on his extended coda, adding at least one false ending too many (even if he does ignore the book's scouring of the shire).

but those who have walked beside these heroes every step of the way on such a long journey deserve the emotional pay-off as well as the action peaks, and they will be genuinely touched as the final credits roll. yes, the ring is dead. long live king kong.


verdict - the resounding climax to a landmark in cinema history. but the king has now returned, the story is over and the ships are leaving middle-earth. ladies and gentlemen, elvish has left the building.

i expected a lot from <em>'the lord of the rings: the return of the king'</em> so i am delighted to see it produce on so many levels. i, funnily enough, wouldn't actually say it's necessarily the most perfect execution - what with the plot coincidences and extreme character armour. but that doesn't matter one jot whatsoever, as the story wraps up in arguably the best way - at least to watch - possible. it has so much heart and feeling to it.

the story involving the characters of elijah wood, sean astin and andy serkis remained the most interesting to me, i was very satisfied with how it concluded in regards to them. i also enjoyed the bits we got of viggo mortensen, ian mckellen & co. all that added to the beautiful look and creation of the film, with the world coming alive splendidly.

if i were to nit-pick further, i would say the run time is slightly too long. the pacing is absolutely fine, very good in fact, but i coulda done without a few of the many end scenes - a lot of which are necessary and welcome, but a couple could've been left out to allow the viewer to imagine how the world continued. that's just how i feel mind, i'm sure i'm one of only a few that think that way.

566,"well... i kind of feel like giving this 10 stars based on salvation and, especially, genisys. i mean, in retrospect, compared to those two, it actually feels like you are watching a really good movie doesn't it?

it has a plot that actually makes sense, and, unlike genisys, it fits into the greater terminator story without changing everything just to, well, just to change the entire canon and story for the sake of... what? i honestly don't know.

however, when you compare it to terminator and t2, it actually seems like you are watching a horrible movie. nick stahl was possibly the worst person to play john conner they could have cast, sarah coner is gone (and with her the protagonist everyone loved) and claire danes just doesn't seem to know what she's doing in the film.

not only that, but stahl comes across as the worst possible leader on earth... and he's the one that is supposed to be the legend that finally beats the machines? seriously? him?

it might have been better if the terminatrix was in it for more than a blink of the eye, but she kind of takes a back seat to everything else that is going on and leaves us wondering why they even added her into the movie.

567,"commander lock: ""not everyone believes what you believe."" morpheus: ""my beliefs do not require that they do."" characters are always talking like this in ""the matrix reloaded,"" which plays like a collaboration involving a geek, a comic book and the smartest kid in philosophy 101. morpheus in particular unreels extended speeches that remind me of laurence olivier's remarks when he won his honorary oscar--the speech that had jon voight going ""god!"" on tv, but in print turned out to be quasi-shakespearean doublespeak. the speeches provide not meaning, but the effect of meaning: it sure sounds like those guys are saying some profound things.

that will not prevent fanboys from analyzing the philosophy of ""the matrix reloaded"" in endless web postings. part of the fun is becoming an expert in the deep meaning of shallow pop mythology; there is something refreshingly ironic about becoming an authority on the transient extrusions of mass culture, and morpheus (laurence fishburne) now joins obi-wan kenobi as the plato of our age.

i say this not in disapproval, but in amusement. ""the matrix"" (1999), written and directed by the brothers andy and larry wachowski, inspired so much inflamed pseudo-philosophy that it's all ""the matrix reloaded"" can do to stay ahead of its followers. it is an immensely skillful sci-fi adventure, combining the usual elements: heroes and villains, special effects and stunts, chases and explosions, romance and oratory. it develops its world with more detail than the first movie was able to afford, gives us our first glimpse of the underground human city of zion, burrows closer to the heart of the secret of the matrix, and promotes its hero, neo, from confused draftee to a christ figure in training.

as we learned in ""the matrix,"" the machines need human bodies, millions and millions of them, for their ability to generate electricity. in an astonishing sequence, we saw countless bodies locked in pods around central cores that extended out of sight above and below. the matrix is the virtual reality that provides the minds of these sleepers with the illusion that they are active and productive. questions arise, such as, is there no more efficient way to generate power? and why give the humans dreams when they would generate just as much energy if comatose? and why create such a complex virtual world for each and every one of them, when they could all be given the same illusion and be none the wiser? why is each dreamer himself or herself, occupying the same body in virtual reality as the one asleep in the pod? but never mind. we are grateful that 250,000 humans have escaped from the grid of the matrix, and gathered to build zion, which is ""near the earth's core--where there is more heat."" as the movie opens, we are alarmed to learn that the machines are drilling toward zion so quickly that they will arrive in 36 hours. we may also wonder if zion and its free citizens really exist, or if the humans only think so, but that leads to a logical loop ending in madness.

neo (keanu reeves) has been required to fly, to master martial arts, and to learn that his faith and belief can make things happen. his fights all take place within virtual reality spaces, while he reclines in a chair and is linked to the cyberworld, but he can really be killed, because if the mind thinks it is dead, ""the body is controlled by the mind."" all of the fight sequences, therefore, are logically contests not between physical bodies, but between video game-players, and the neo in the big fight scenes is actually his avatar.

the visionary morpheus, inspired by the prophecies of the oracle, instructed neo--who gained the confidence to leap great distances, to fly and in ""reloaded"" destroys dozens of clones of agent smith (hugo weaving) in martial combat. that fight scene is made with the wonders of digital effects and the choreography of the hong kong action director yuen wo ping, who also did the fights in ""crouching tiger, hidden dragon."" it provides one of the three great set pieces in the movie.

the second comes when morpheus returns to zion and addresses the assembled multitude--an audience that looks like a mosh pit crossed with the underground slaves in ""metropolis."" after his speech, the citizens dance in a percussion-driven frenzy, which is intercut with neo and trinity (carrie-anne moss) having sex. i think their real bodies are having the sex, although you can never be sure.

the third sensational sequence is a chase involving cars, motorcycles and trailer trucks, with gloriously choreographed moves including leaps into the air as a truck continues to move underneath. that this scene logically takes place in cyberspace does not diminish its thrilling 14-minute fun ride, although we might wonder--when deadly enemies meet in one of these virtual spaces, who programmed it? (i am sure i will get untold thousands of e-mails explaining it all to me.) i became aware, during the film, that a majority of the major characters were played by african americans. neo and trinity are white, and so is agent smith, but consider morpheus; his superior commander lock (harry lennix); the beautiful and deadly niobe (jada pinkett smith), who once loved morpheus and now is with lock, although she explains enigmatically that some things never change; the programmer link (harold perrineau); link's wife, zee (nona gaye), who has the obligatory scene where she complains he's away from home too much, and the oracle (the late gloria foster, very portentous). from what we can see of the extras, the population of zion is largely black.

it has become commonplace for science fiction epics to feature one or two african-american stars, but we've come a long way since billy dee williams in ""return of the jedi."" the wachowski brothers use so many african americans, i suspect, not for their box-office appeal, because the matrix is the star of the movie, and not because they are good actors (which they are), but because to the white teenagers who are the primary audience for this movie, african-americans embody a cool, a cachet, an authenticy. morpheus is the power center of the movie, and neo's role is essentially to study under him and absorb his mojo.

the film ends with ""to be concluded,"" a reminder that the third film in the trilogy arrives in november. toward the end, there are scenes involving characters who seem pregnant with possibilities for part 3. one is the architect (helmut bakaltis), who says he designed the matrix and revises everything neo thinks he knows about it. is the architect a human, or an avatar of the machines? the thing is, you can never know for sure. he seems to hint that when you strip away one level of false virtual reality, you find another level beneath. maybe everything so far is several levels up? stephen hawking's a brief history of time tells the story of a cosmologist whose speech is interrupted by a little old lady who informs him that the universe rests on the back of a turtle. ""ah, yes, madame,"" the scientist replies, ""but what does the turtle rest on?"" the old lady shoots back: ""you can't trick me, young man. it's nothing but turtles, turtles, turtles, all the way down.""

576,"**style, blood, guts and hard rock, without any decent script to back it up.**

rob zombie has devoted his life to music and horror movies, but so far i haven't seen a single movie of his that's really worthwhile. the director's style is that very low-budget and low-quality horror that made school in the 70s and 80s. in truth, i must say that there is some coherence here, if we consider the musical style of zombie's projects. however, it is a film that disgusts us, and that causes more strangeness and repudiation than fear.

in this film, we follow four teenagers who accidentally stumble into a village of abnormal people and end up intrigued by a local legend about a mad doctor who cut people up, was executed and disappeared, leaving in doubt whether he had really died. of course, they end up in an even crazier, morbid and dysfunctional house of people, who are behind an endless series of crimes.

by my standards, this movie is so bad that it doesn't even work as a comedy. there is not a scary moment, based on a strangely bizarre script, without content. the film shows the influences of slash horror, with lots of gore, blood running everywhere and bodies torn to pieces. cannibalism, necrophilia, sadism, if we think of depravity this film will probably have some scene associated with what we think. that, on the one hand, has a vantage point: the film is gritty enough to pull it off, in an era when horror movies are so bland that even underage kids can see them.

the cast brings together a series of actors who have become famous precisely in slash cinema: sid haig, bill moseley, karen black, tom towles, dennis fimple. each one of them did their job well, they are the right actors for this type of material, they are perfectly comfortable doing this. however, haig and moseley are particularly effective and work very well, stealing the audience's attention whenever they appear. sheri moon, an actress who has a certain relevance in the film, is however an amateur, rob zombie's girlfriend, who entered the film at his request. love has these things, it makes us do crazy things. unfortunately, and as it is routine in these films, the teenage victims of the carnage are simply talking meat that we can't care less about for a minute.

the film does some pretty competent visual effects work, with gallons of fake blood and other effects designed to make the killing realistic and ""fun"" enough. the sets and costumes were also very well thought out and create a decadent environment, in which rurality is distorted and transformed into the perfect environment for a halloween massacre. that is, the film has style, it has an extremely worked and complex look, but that's about it. it does not present us with content, substance that makes the film worthwhile.",low

don't get me wrong, it's fine to have simple dreams, and the romanticism of paris is great for ""small town"" folk aspirations, but the movie leans on it pretty heavy for comedy purposes.

if you peel back a couple of layers, there is a great metaphor for woman empowerment and being able to reach their goals through hard work and networking, but it is really subtle.

this movie oozes with style and beautifully choreographed action. this movie has an anime section akin to japanese anime. that's some cool stuff. even the non-action parts are some really good stuff. like the guy from the old street fighter movies as hatori hanzo and making the bride's sword. and the fantastic soundtrack. the great opening scene where the bride gets shot and then the somber ""bang bang"" by nancy sinatra plays. 

but of course, the amazingly choreographed action makes this movie. a lot of it is showcased in the crazy 88 fight and the few fights before it. it has some brilliant uses of the style. of course, there's black and white which was actually used to avoid an nc-17, but works very effectively. and the beautifully shot battle between the bride and o-ren. no music really adds a lot to it. it's quiet and oh so effective compared to the loud blood fest of the crazy 88. 

but there's also the opening hand to hand fight scene with vernita green which is also very well edited. very surprising scene as it is interrupted by green's daughter coming home and then they talk. and it starts back again as quickly as it began and then ends once again with a knife to vernita's chest. what a brilliant tension filled scene.

the movie also never takes itself too seriously. that's for the sequel. but the fun action and style leads the whole way. also along with buck, and other fun scenes. lest we forget other great scenes like the whistle scene as elle driver comes to kill the bride in her sleep. or interrogating sophie.

a sparse soundstage is stylishly utilized to create a minimalist small-town setting in which a mysterious woman named grace (nicole kidman) hides from the criminals who pursue her. the town locals at first decide to shield grace, and in return she openly works labour tasks for them to work off her gratitude. it's not long, however, before the residents of dogville begin to show their true teeth...

one thing is an absolute, lars von trier knows how to push the buttons of critics and movie lovers alike. dogville proved to be a case in point, a film that saw some high profile film critics renounce the director as anti american - even anti human, while others lauded the ""great dane"" as a visionary and a director of bravura panache. the point is, and it's a fact, there is no guarantee that dogville will hit the spot of every first time viewer venturing in for the challenge.

as it happens, i'm very much in the plus camp here, to me it's not only brave in style of production, but also it's narratively as caustic as anything so called ""anti human"" directors like kubrick, godard etc ever produced. the bareness of the sound stage setting, where we can see the workings of all residents of dogville going about their respective business, very much shows there is no hiding place, all the bile strewn movements/ignorance is laid bare for all to see, we are all complicit.

there's an outstanding cast assembled, fronted by kidman (never more beautiful and never better as an actress), with support coming from paul bettany, stellan skarsgård, lauren bacall, ben gazzara, patricia clarkson, james caan, philip baker hall and others who give their all for their director. it's often charged that trier is a misogynist, personally i don't see it that way, more so as dogville reaches its crushing climax. this easily could have been shaved of 20 minutes from the run time, but it has to be said that von trier doesn't waste a single frame here.

on this watching of dogville, it finally hit me that this story is the life story of a woman in an abusive relationship. maybe inspired in part by polly's ""seeräuberjenny"" from threepenny opera, or not. nonetheless, the film script is the same as what might be experienced by a woman drawn into a relationship by a seemingly enchanting man(town). eventually, as it turns exploitive and finally abusive, she becomes numb and resigned. some women never escape that stage. some women are able to escape and most of those are murdered by the abuser. and a few actually murder the abuser. perhaps the latter is the only way out.",high

as mowgli struggles with being of two worlds (an arguably great point from the original movie), he extends his entitled behavior to returning to the jungle, aggravating the village, as sher khan returns to hunting mowgli, extending his obsession / pride (sort of a moby dick thing).

lacking some creativity, they return to some of the old songs (3 that i can think of, ""bear necessities"" and ""jungle rhythm"" being over used, and ""i wanna be like you"" at the credits of all places) instead of using original material.

as the adventures continue it's reveal that mowgli had no natural connection to the animals, it's just that everything speaks english, the other human characters don't bat an eye or lose a beat.  it completely ruins the movie.  at least in tarzan it was clear he would ""ooh ooh"" to the guerillas.  what little charm they were able to drag from the previous movie to this one is just destroyed by that.

the dramatization of mowgli's endangerment also has a lesser impact this time, as he's survived before, and this time around we also have 2 other hapless children running about the jungle who must have been blessed with invincibility to survive all that they do.

602,"compared to the book, yeah, it stinks...but that's really only because it got lost somewhere in translation from prose to screen.

take it as it is, take it as a movie and its not half bad, the problem is that, once you leave the book behind what you have is an old fashioned b horror movie that is trying to sell itself in an era where b horror movies need the special effects of modern super hero movies and the basic plot of a dick and jane novel.

and then, in many ways, it's just too expensive. it feels like a classic drive-in horror flick, but it looks like a block buster. tone down the budget by a few million and make it a direct to video movie and it would have cult classic status already...despite the people that actually read the source material.

the acting is good, the special effects are too good, the setting is cool, but the plot hurts a bit and the fact that duddits is intellectually disabled is inevitably going to put off more that a few viewers.

really though, what you have is a great b movie drive-in fair that somehow got an actual budget wot work with. and you could do a lot worse in this post new hollywood day and age.",high
603,"**tons of stylish action, a big budget, a script reduced to the minimum and a huge list of actors with nothing to do.**

it was only when i saw this film that i realized that it is the last film in a trilogy that begins with “mariachi”. however, i saw it after having seen “desperado” and that allowed me to have a better understanding of the story: the gunman and his girlfriend are chased by a drug dealer until the day his men manages to kill the girl. devastated, the mariachi retires to live out his days in bitterness. after a while, he is called by a cia agent, who gives him the opportunity to take revenge while preventing the total success of a military coup that will assassinate the mexican president.

sound confusing? maybe because it is! the script is very light, without beauty, care for details or stylistic refinement, and the text ends up being dominated by what i defined, sarcastically, as “latinxploitation” when i wrote for “desperado”: a bunch of cheap stereotypes about latinos and mexicans. and i continue to have the feeling that these films are not healthful to clear up these preconceived ideas that dance in the heads of white, anglo-saxon, english-speaking america.

if we saw director robert rodríguez dazzled by action scenes in “desperado”, here he lost his mind: there are enough bullets for another invasion of iraq. for those who live far away, mexico may seem like a highly corrupt country and the difficulties that the authorities face in the fight against well-armed, cruel cartels with strong allies abroad are very well known. the film, however, takes two steps further and transforms mexico into a land without law or ruler, where the order comes from those with bigger weapons and their hands deep in cocaine. perhaps for this reason, the film did not have much support from the mexican authorities and ended up not even showing the mexican flag which, in the film's presidential palace, is replaced by something else with stars. i am still unable to fully understand this flag exchange. speaking of action, was i the only one who smelled a faint whiff of tarantino in this film's action scenes?

of course, with all this, the film develops and evolves very quickly, and we don't have any dead or boring moments. from an entertainment point of view, the film works very well, considering that we are an audience that seeks action and doesn't mind turning off our brains and accepting what is given to us. the underlying problem is that, if the script is already weak, things get worse if it speeds up like this. after a point, it no longer matters who is trying to do what. they're all shooting. for what reason? maybe they don't even know!

despite the poverty of the material given to him and the poor construction of his character, antónio banderas continues to deserve our attention, even if, in this film, it is unquestionably depp who stands out when we talk about the cast. there aren't many actors capable of shining in an underwritten character, but he does it and steals the spotlight whenever he appears, sending banderas to the corner and turning salma hayek into an extra. eva mendes is sexy, but she has no material to work with, and willem dafoe is very weak. there are a lot of renowned actors and even a singer – enrique iglesias – in the cast list, which shows more desire to be in this project than the ability to add something good to the final product.",low
604,"ang lee helped revolutionize superhero related films forever with hulk (2003). rather than just have the hero try to save the world, lee and james schamus decided to have bruce banner deal with his freudian psychology, specifically the repressed memories he had thirty years ago about his father.

the acting talents of eric bana, jennifer connelly, nick nolte, sam elliott and josh lucas are perfect for the five main characters. bana was able to do intentional wooden acting to hide his character's repressed emotions while connelly conveyed kindness as her oscar winning role from a beautiful mind (2001).

what i loved about lee's interpretation is that he did not care about faithfulness. he cared about showing a cerebral kind of superhero film that later got imitated with the dark knight trilogy (2005-2012), watchmen (2009), logan (2017), dawn of justice (2016) and suicide squad (2016).

628,"charlie’s angels full throttle fully accelerates whilst narratively stuck in second gear. can i order a mcg sandwich please? huh? you have no filling? sure, i’ll just take the overly stylised sauce. my personal adoration for this sequel’s predecessor is one that cannot be described fully without tackling the realms of lunacy and diminishing my own critical insight. it’s just a special piece of camp nostalgia for me, even if its construction is more amateurish than diaz’ dance moves. interestingly, this continuation was also on repeat as i galloped around the room to the soundtrack of the prodigy and the chemical brothers, witnessing physically impossible aerobatic stunts. however, after all these years, it’s time to succumb to the realisation that full throttle is a bad film.

much like the first feature, its plot is a secondary product to the outlandish femme fatale antics. this time the angels must secure two h.a.l.o. rings which probably has something to do with monetisation and greed. don’t ask me! for i honestly do not know. a stationery barrymore sliding fully under a low table without the use of her arms had me entranced. liu leaping sixty feet into the air by just jumping off a table had me hypnotised. and of course, diaz bopping to mc hammer’s “u can’t touch this” had me salivating. these, including the last point (have you tried side stepping that rapidly!?), are physically impossible to perform.

the wired stunts and choreography are so exaggerated that it becomes laughably terrible, juxtaposing the semi-realistic narrative that mcg is attempting to convey. driving off a dam whilst trying to fly into a helicopter and take off (all in mid-air by the way...) before it crashes? sure. why not. performing motocross stunts whilst upside down and shooting the angels? eh. i’ll let it slide. using a lace cape as a squirrel suit, throwing a bomb into a film premiere and perfectly landing in a car whilst being pursed by the angels who are hanging onto illuminated wires? ummm. i guess. being tossed through a shop window, like a rag doll, and walking it off before getting changed for the premiere? now wait just a minute! heightened stunts and ‘matrix’-styled slow motion is all fine and dandy, but i need an ounce of realism in order to feel threatened by the danger on screen. the angels are invulnerable to everything, making the entire ordeal worthless.

yes, using a flamethrower to “firestarter” is bonafide brilliance and shaped me to be the man that i am today. yet the random action set pieces (to which there are loads!) cannot justify the narrative’s direction. again, frustrating considering the onscreen chemistry of diaz, barrymore and liu. the one and only demi moore is used for an underdeveloped plot twist, as she suggestively licks diaz’ face. oh, and bernie mac replaced murray. a fine replacement, but again, under-utilised. let’s not even discuss theroux’s insulting irish accent. the technical aspects, especially the garish green screen and floaty human cgi, unintentionally adds characteristics to the film in general, yet still executed terribly. and the callback “humour”, mostly consisting of the “creepy thin man” and the angels’ relationship, were cringeworthy at best. although, the ongoing innuendos between alex and her father did make me chuckle continuously.

is it enough to substantiate a sequel that showcases the apparent curse of “more is better”? absolutely not. whilst the heart of charlie’s angels resides within, its discombobulated exterior diminished most of the heavenly fun to be had.",low
631,"high on action, low on grey matter.

i guess when push comes to shove it’s an action film that delivers the requisite supply of biff, bam and kerpow action sequences. yet even allowing for the old “leave the brain at the door” requirement for such action comic malarkey, the script is too poor, the acting equally so, while the choreography is weak. the latter of which a big misstep when you have jet li and mark dacascos fronting the good guy/bad guy axis of the story.

plot pitches li’s ass kicking detective with dmx’s urban thief together as an unlikely buddy buddy combo trailing missing diamonds and dmx’s kidnapped daughter, and that’s pretty much it. there’s no attempts to expand the characters or add some emotional depth to what is meant to be a pretty critical situation.

it often feels tired, like a recycling of so many other film’s of similar ilk, originality is out the window here, hell they even get tom arnold in to reprise a watered down version of his character from true lies. gabrielle union and kelly hu are on hand to add the sexy sizzle in thankless roles, while dacascos barely registers as an uber villain.

644,"for england, for home, and for the prize!  

master and commander: the far side of the world is directed by peter weir, it stars russell crowe as jack aubrey and paul bettany as stephen maturin. it is spliced from various novels in the aubrey–maturin series written by patrick o'brian. the film takes place during 1805, during the napoleonic wars and finds captain jack aubrey and the crew of british frigate hms surprise ordered to intercept, destroy or take as a prize the french privateer acheron. but the acheron (the phantom as the crew of the surprise call her) is no ordinary ship, and her captain is smart. so lucky jack has his work cut out; not only in the pursuit of the acheron, but in harmonising the crew under his command. especially his loyal and trusting friend stephen.

it's pretty evident within the first few minutes of master & commander that this is no standard blockbusting naval based war movie. if you are after, or was expecting, a wave to wave bruckheimer carnage a-like piece, well you best, or should have, stay(ed) away. for this is a peter weir movie, in fact this is a peter weir ""period"" movie, where attention to details and character dynamics are the order of the day. there's battle action here for sure, beginning and end, and terrific they are too, as first cannonballs crack and splinter their targets (note the sound work here), and later as blade meets blade - it's exhilarating stuff alright. however, this is more interested in palpable tension, both on deck and on the waves. threat is never far away, again, this is is covered by the impending duel with the acheron and aubrey's tactical pursuit/escape of her. as the aubrey machinations unfurl, the crew give us a series of character dramas to involve us in the make up of a man-o-war's personnel. how different classes and males (there's not one female in the film) of all ages have to work together as one efficient unit in order to survive and triumph. except for an interlude spent on the lusciously filmed galapagos island (russell boyd best cinematography academy award winner), the film is set 99% of the time out at sea, on a cramped ship, this tells you that weir is interested in telling a character driven story, one that is cloaked in realism above all else.

the teaming of weir with the highly rated o'brian material looked a good one, and to someone like me who has never read an o'brian novel, it is. unsurprisingly many of o'brian's fans have been upset by either the stuff missing in the film, the stuff put in to fully form weir's vision of the characters, or for crowe not being pugwashy enough. these complaints were inevitable since they come with practically every adaptation of novels these days. it should be noted, though, that weir was very much a fan of o'brian, and in fact always felt inspired by the tight intricate detail of his writings. what of the author himself? well he passed away three years before the film was released, but he had always envisaged charlton heston for the role of aubrey. so, who in the modern era comes closest to heston's physical presence on screen, why russell crowe of course. who not only brings that to the character, but also depth, because aubrey comes with many traits. strength, honour, stubbornness, leadership and loyalty are a given for a captain on the high seas. yet aubrey is also vulnerable, self aware, playful, knows his limitations and is able to laugh at himself. crowe peels off each layer and delivers a high quality performance - from our first encounter with crowe as aubrey, the realism so loved by weir is given a shot in the arm - and it stays throughout the movie.

so an excellent piece of casting then, as is that of paul bettany as ships surgeon, science and nature lover, and best pal of the captain, stephen maturin. bettany and crowe had formed a friendship on 2001's a beautiful mind, where their on screen chemistry lifted an already fine film, to an even better one. so it be here also. stephen & jack's relationship is the core of the piece, two very different men yet as tight as two peas in a pod, with stephen serving as the code breaker for the audience as sea talk and tactical intrigue weaves in and out of the story. it's there where bettany excels, for he not only has us believing in this warm (platonic) friendship, he's also got us rooting for him since he is in essence the odd man out on this ship. our sympathy is firmly with him, our friendly rebel if you please. of the rest there's note worthy turns from billy boyd, james d'arcy & edward woodall, while lee ingleby gives a really heartfelt and emotionally engaging turn as the haunted hollom.

the film is not without flaws, though. the pace of the piece does slip from time to time, while the talky middle section may stretch the patience of some, and the film isn't long enough to give the main characters some back story for the audience to work off. yet it's still a terrific movie, ripe with intelligence and interesting characterisations, and boasting enough adrenalin, humour and upset to fill out a big budgeted 1950s historical epic. so get on board folks, for this is quality film making and it demands to be seen via the best format available. 9/10",high
645,"this is a rousing sea yarn with great camera work, but it also shows comraderie and relationships in a realistic way on board a british fighting ship.

as happens sometimes but not always, i enjoyed this movie more than i liked the book it was based upon. o'brian has written a lot of great sea tales, but this one confused me. i felt like checking to see if the pages were in the correct order. the story seems simplified in this adaptation. (some may say that is not a good thing!)

the first several minutes of the film move the viewer around the ship, and i felt like it was a realistic representation of what it was like to sail on it. the creaking and other ever-present noises, the tight spaces allotted to the crew, all helped me feel like i knew what it was like more than just reading about it.

there are a lot of characters aboard ship, so out of necessity some of them never really developed, but even the glimpses we get of them here and there illustrate that they are people, not stereotypes. there were a few rather unlikely plot turns later on in the film, but by then i was drawn into the story and right there with the crew, so i forgave them.  i have watched master and commander twice so far, and wouldn't be averse to seeing it again.",high

that all takes away the fun of a movie that had the potential to be a high seas epic like, say, captain blood.

honestly, its hard to sit down and watch a man try to upstage everyone in every scene, especially when they are actors that could hold their own against crowe...if crowe allowed that to happen.

most of the cast do great here, both robert duvall & kevin costner bounce of each other with moody and world wise aplomb as the two main leads, while in the sole female role of note, annette bening is gusto beautiful personified. sadly it's hard for me to write that michael gambon as the villain of the piece is not only underused, but also something of a let down. such an accomplished actor should know better than to overdo it in the context of this particular story. yes we get the need for villainy, but gurning and frothing doesn't quite make the grade here. it's a little surprising that director costner didn't utilise gambon more wisely.

696,"_**engaging psychological drama with ludivine sagnier and charlotte rampling**_

""swimming pool"" (2003) is a drama/psychological thriller about a popular english novelist named, sarah (charlotte rampling), who vacations at her publisher's villa in france to find inspiration for her next book. unfortunately, the publisher's oversexed daughter, julie (ludivine sagnier), visits and disrupts her activities.

if you remember 70s' films like ""orca"" and ""zardoz"" you'll know that rampling was stunning in her physical prime in a looks-that-kill way. in ""swimming pool"" she's still in decent shape for a woman verging on 60, but her character's a joyless biyatch desperately seeking inspiration. julie, by contrast, is young, friendly and overflowing with sexuality, but – like sarah – she's not a pushover in the least.

sagnier shines as the wild child french hottie. there's just something about the female french accent that's a turn-on. despite her sexiness, it's clear in some scenes that julie's actually sort of plain in a girl-next-door kind of way. it's what she does with what she's got that makes her stunning.

like 2005's ""match point,"" ""swimming pool"" is the antithesis of the modern 'blockbuster' and all its moronic trappings -- there's no quick editing, no cgi, no goofy one-liners, no explosions and no promise of $400 million at the box office. no, ""swimming pool"" is movie-making based simply on excellent writing and cinematic storytelling. the end is a revelation to the viewer even if you were expecting it, particularly because, if you research it, it's way more than even that, believe it or not. it's amazing how good writing & storytelling can create a 'wow' reaction more so than the most elaborate overkill action sequence with all its requisite cgi and explosions.

the film runs 102 minutes and was shot in luberon, vaucluse, france, and london.

grade: a-

***spoiler alert*** (don't read further if you haven't seen the film)

the obvious interpretation is that julie isn't real, but rather a character created by sarah for her next book whereas julia is the publisher's real daughter, revealed at the end. people who draw this conclusion, like me on my first two viewings, are on the right track, but this interpretation is only accurate to a point. for details see the thread on the moviechat message board ""the definitive answer / color-key to swimming pool.""",high

while the first tcm was not perfect, i eventually learned to love the shaky camera, lousy sound, and cheap look. one reason that film worked for me was the fact that much of the horror took place in blinding daylight, the cast was hot and uncomfortable, and it showed. in this version, even with the original's director of photography, most of the shots are too calculated. the horrors in the dark are not all that horrifying. this might be the rantings of a jaded horror film fan, but i never got the same feeling of unease as i did in the first film. much of the original's story has been changed as film makers tried to keep the audience guessing by not doing a shot by shot remake, like gus van sant's ""psycho."" the absolute lunacy of the first film's family was strange enough, here the members are more dimwitted than scary. this lessens the impact of leatherface's scenes. you know he is the worst it can get, you don't have an equally sick family to fall back on. one disappointing scene involves the heroine erin (jessica biel) running to a trailer and meeting two women who will obviously not help her. instead of being a tense moment, where mind games involving drinking a seemingly harmless cup of tea could be played out, the women are there for nothing more than exposition, blaming leatherface's penchant to kill on being teased when he was younger for a degenerative skin disease. the five victims all meld together, nispel's direction is okay, but the cinematography is too nice for this type of horror film. the black and white scratchy scenes recall tv's ""millennium"" or ""the blair witch project."" if i would compare ""the texas chainsaw massacre"" to anything, it would be the terrible sequels that came out after the original ""the texas chainsaw massacre"" to that point. just one was watchable, ""leatherface,"" but with the exception of part 2, they were all simply remakes of the original film. most direct to video sequels do that now, and while this film tries to be something different, it is simply a remake that cannot match the original. as leatherface and the clan enter a new millennium, their wrinkles were showing.",low
704,"ah, but you have heard of me.

the crew of the black pearl are cursed by something most unimaginable, the only way to lift the curse is to return a lost aztec coin to its treasure chest home. in the way of them achieving their goal is the british governor's daughter, the son of bootstrap turner, oh and a former comrade by the name of captain jack sparrow who the crew had left to die on an island some time ago.

it's now common knowledge that pirates of the caribbean is a film based upon a theme park ride of the same name, thoughg that ride is not actually a roller-coaster, it's fair to say that this film most assuredly is. a swashbuckling ripper of an adventure yarn cramming in every pirate film staple it can and pouring on layers of charm at every turn. into the broth goes romance, comedy and striking adventure, and director gore verbinski even manages to give the children watching little slices of horror, not enough to keep them up at night, but enough to bring on an uneasy grin.

it's unashamedly commercial, produced by that purveyor of ott entertainment values, jerry bruckheimer, it was to be expected, but few blockbusting movies of the new age can lay claim to being such an out and out reason for having fun. this is the reason why pirates had few peers at the time of its release, for it knows its reason for being, it's not taking itself seriously. the audience is not being hoodwinked in any way, they are having fun because so is the film and so is, crucially, the impressive cast. johnny depp as sparrow is having the time of his life, basing the character around the dubious mannerisms of rolling stone icon, keith richards, it works to its highest potential and depp is simply wonderful in the role. keira knightley (perfectly cast), orlando bloom, geoffrey rush, jack davenport, jonathan pryce and mackenzie crook all do what was asked, which is essentially say your lines right and have a blast with it, it really is that sort of picture.

the subsequent sequels would forget what made this first offering so enjoyable, foregoing the outrageous sense of fun for a dark sheen and character development. that is a shame, but at the very least we still have this wonderful picture to go back to time and time again, to lift you up when one is down or to keep one happy when one is already in that happy place. the curse of the black pearl is a joy from start to finish. 9/10",high

707,"***evils of the past and the problems with vigilante justice***

released in 2003 and directed by clint eastwood, “mystic river” tells the story of three men from a working class neighborhood in boston. while playing in the street as kids, one of them is abducted and sexually abused for days. as adults they’ve drifted apart. jimmy (sean penn) is a reformed con who runs a successful market when his daughter is suddenly murdered (emmy rossum). sean (kevin bacon) investigates the murder with his partner, whitey (laurence fishburne), with evidence eventually pointing toward dave (timothy bottoms), the one who was abducted. marcia gay harden plays dave’s anxious spouse while laura linney plays jimmy’s loyal wife.

this is similar in tone & theme to the melancholy “sleepers” (1996), but less episodic and more dramatically gripping. the movie has the confidence to take its time and flesh-out the characters. it’s a psychological crime drama that works as both a whodunit and a tragedy. the intrinsic problems of vigilante justice are cogently illustrated.

some people have misinterpreted the movie because they missed some things. for instance, they criticize the curious lady macbeth-like monologue of annabeth (linney) at the end. but watch the movie again, pay close attention, and the answers are there. i’d say more, but i don’t want to give anything away (you’re welcome to write me if you’d like some insights). 

“mystic river” is not something that can be casually watched; it’s a deep drama with three-dimensional characters, potently exploring several intriguing issues: how abuses of the past affect the present; the danger of hiding recesses of your psyche; the folly of not getting spiritual help for deep-rooted psychological concerns; disloyalty/loyalty; doing the wrong thing for the right reasons; jumping to wrong conclusions based on dubious info; houses divided cannot stand; the importance of encouraging one’s spouse for the sake of familial health & survival; “king of the castle”; etc.

the film runs 2 hours, 18 minutes and was shot in boston.

720,"it wears its sentimental heart firmly on its fetlock.  

as the depression era kicks in, americans were grasping for any sort of inspiration they could get, enter equine supreme, seabiscuit. considered broken down, too small and untrainable, seabiscuit went on to become a bastion of great racehorses and in the process bringing solace to those closest to it.

back in 2003 upon its initial release, critics were very divided as to the merits of seabiscuit as a picture. some were concerned that this adaptation from laura hillenbrand's highly thought of novel missed too many crucial elements, others were merely touting the tired old charge of the film purely baiting oscar (something that is levelled at every film in history about hope and second chances), the more astute critics of the time however lauded it as the delightful and inspiring piece that it is.

it would be churlish of me to not agree that seabiscuit is laced with sentiment, rookie director gary ross barely wastes a chance to tug the heart strings and paint an evocative sequence, but if you have got it in you to accept this true story for its base emotional point, then it is one hell of a wonderful experience. seabiscuit is not just about the equine beauty of the picture, it's also a fusion of three men's personal wavering, who for one reason or another need the horse for far more important crutches than those provided by financial gain, make no bones about it, seabiscuit is a very human drama. knowing how the picture will end never once becomes a problem, because the historical accuracy in the story makes one yearn for that grandiose ending, one to gladden the heart in the way it must have done to thousands upon thousands of americans back in the depression era day.

ross wisely chooses to filter in as much realism as he possibly can, archive stills and narration serve as exceptional points of worth to the narrative structure. then there is the first rate cast to fully form the emotional complexities that seabiscuit provides. jeff bridges, tobey maguire (waif like), chris cooper, elizabeth banks, top american jockey gary stevens and a splendidly jaunty william h macy, all can rightly feel proud of their respective work on this picture. yet it's with the thundering race sequences that seabiscuit really triumphs best, magnificent beasts hurtling around the race track are excellently handled by ross and his cinematographer, john schwartzman, whilst a nod of approval must go to the sound department's efforts, for this is definitely one to give your sub-woofer a work out.

seabiscuit was nominated for seven academy awards, winning none, perhaps the academy also felt like those critics who thought it was trying too hard for a golden statue? but now after the dust has settled some years later, it pays to revisit seabiscuit and judge it on its own emotional terms, for it's a tremendously well crafted picture that is of course as inspirational as it most assuredly is tender, a fine fine picture indeed. 9/10",high
722,"you are not hardcore unless you live hardcore.

the perfect vehicle for jack black, a film to show that given the right material he’s a bona fide comedic actor of some worth. plot has black as dewey finn, a wastrel musician who has no job prospects and who spends his time mooching off of his best mate ned sheebly (mike white). when dewey is fired from his rock band he’s left in limbo and in danger of being homeless. but when he answers a phone call offering ned a job assignment, dewey decides to take it upon himself to impersonate ned and take the employment himself; as a schoolteacher!

so it’s jack black in a classroom full of kids, it probably shouldn’t work, and even might seem like some sort of cruel and unusual punishment to anyone with an aversion to black, but this is feel good nirvana and a paean to rock and roll. it’s perhaps unsurprising that it’s crammed with clichés from the classroom splinter of moviedom, the kids a roll call of characters we have seen numerous times. the spoilt swot, the roughneck, the one suffering parental peer pressure, the weight issue one and on it goes, but boy can they play music when dewey takes them out of classical mode and into rock central.

how nice to find that director richard linklater and writer mike white have managed to rise above the clichés and avoid syrupy fodder, there’s such a zest and earnestness to it all, and the kids acting is high in quality as well, led by the big kid himself, black on full tilt. but most of all, even as the morals and life affirming threads come wading in with the pulsing rock soundtrack, it’s a very funny picture, the gag quota enormously high. be it black trying to bluff the kids, the kids trying to bluff everyone else - or the wonderful joan cusack as the scatty stickler for the rules principal mullins – a laugh is never far away. rock on! 8.5/10",high
726,"true love transcends sexual expression

released in 2003 and written & directed by sofia coppola, ""lost in translation"" was a big hit in 2003-2004. it's about an aging actor, bob harris (bill murray), who's in tokyo doing commercials for a week. his home-life is mundane and he's experiencing a bit of the mid-life crisis. he runs into an attractive 20 year-old something woman, charlotte (scarlett johansson), who's in tokyo with her photog husband (), but he's gone most of the time and takes her for granted.

this is a mature, semi-arty film and you have to be in the right mode/maturity level to appreciate it. i said ""maturity level"" and not ""age"" because some people are pretty mature at 16 while others are completely immature at 50. for me, the story, music and visuals pulled me into these characters’ temporary world for the 102-minute runtime.

the film succeeds as an amusing social commentary and a deep love story, as well as a visual/musical delight. i'll only focus on the deep love element. it's been noted that the story originated from sofia's experience with an aging actor when she was younger, possibly harrison ford. sofia is obviously charlotte, while charlotte's husband is sofia's ex and anna faris plays the role of the other woman, which would be cameron diaz in real life. so there's a lot of reality in the picture.

but it's not just a cathartic piece. sofia has some potent insights to offer on the nature of true romantic love. for one, love transcends age difference (bob is about 35 years older than charlotte). for another, it's possible to be married and experience romantic love for another. not that this ever justifies adultery, it's just a fact. as the story progresses you'll see how comfortable bob and charlotte are with each other, how they look into each other's eyes, the windows of the soul, in a profoundly naked sense. this can happen in the flash of a moment where the two people just know, or it can take place over a period of time, as is the case with bob and charlotte (which is a handful of days). they see the same things and speak the same language, and i don't mean english. but this presents a conundrum for bob. bob could take advantage of charlotte because she's so lonely in a sea of people, which is one of the movie's themes; she's also inexperienced and vulnerable. will he or won't he take advantage? 

***spoiler alert*** don't read further if you haven't seen the film.

if bob loves charlotte so much, not to mention his wife & kids, why does he have a one-night stand with the lounge singer (catherine lambert)? bob slept with her to release sexual tension that had been building up between him and charlotte. this was a moral failure, but keep in mind he was drunk (another failure but, have pity, he was going through a mid-life crisis). while all this is obvious, it goes deeper...

bob could have taken advantage of charlotte if he wanted to but didn't because he genuinely loved her, which is revealed at the end. bob could sleep with the singer because he didn't love her (not that it justifies his actions). simply put, true love transcends sexual expression and sexual union does not equal love.

the ending is powerful and tear-inducing. no cgi, explosion or action stunt can compare. it's just an older man and a too-young woman embracing in the midst of 20 million strangers. tears flow, kisses are given and unheard words are whispered. they could never be a couple, even if they weren't married, and they know they'll never see each other again, at least on this physical plane, but their love has been expressed and will be treasured for eternity.

759,"brought to us by wiseau-films working with chloe productions and tpw films is probably one of the worst films i have seen recently as i have discussed the film with others in my own podcast on inside movies galore and i’m still on the fence whether i actually like the film. i watched this film twice once for my podcast and once for another that is enough and i will probably never watch this film again in my life if i don’t have to.

this is tommy wiseau’s debut film from 2003 where he plays a man named johnny who has a beautiful blonde hair girlfriend named lisa played by juliette danielle whom is actually kind of a bitch. johnny has a working class job as a banker, takes care of a teenager named denny, who insists almost on being a peeping tom on their sex life, comes home to his woman lisa and over time finds out she is cheating on him with his best friend mark played by greg sestero then offs himself… on a budget of six million how can you film something like this?

denny a young teenager is not entirely living with johnny but is more like a son to him is caught up in the mix and gets into trouble with a drug dealer but you also see some kind of turmoil that mark goes through as he does feel guilty sleeping with lisa but he enjoys it but is probably the most annoying actor on the set with his high pitched squeals. also the fact of lisa’s friends whom just can’t keep from fucking, started story plots that weren’t entirely needed and felt they were an after thought.

the music behind the film feels like it should be in one of those older 80’s canon fairy tales or something like masterpiece theater, but also elicit’s the feel of soft core love scenes like that what you would see on hbo after dark when it comes to the passionate scenes between mark and johnny. i also feel that when johnny taped the phone calls lisa made on one of those old tape machine’s feels slightly dated as this was a film done in 2003. i feel like the balcony scene was the worst scene as when they were up there you could tell that there was a stage wall behind them as the cast was talking as i understand this was called a green room.

though i love dubbed films in martial arts type films and toho productions i think that having the actors and actress’s including tommy dub their voices in was absolutely awful, mixed with his geriatrics of getting angry at lisa, tommy was annoyingly eccentric, there wasn’t a line in the film that was even remotely original. it’s all been said before but i do have to say are quotable. i feel like i should love this movie but i’ve decided that i do not and only mildly enjoy the film as it is just that bad and even then i’m not sure that enjoyment can be the word decribing how i feel about the film. i don’t understand the reason behind why people enjoy the film but point blank it’s terrible. terribly edited, basically a film you can probably take to a film class and say here’s what not to do.

i didn’t enjoy watching this film. i watched it for the purpose of discussing it on podcasts. i’ll definitely not recommend it to others either but i will say it paved the way to “the disaster artist” which looks like it could be an even better film than this piece of trash. i’m sorry to shit on film growing a cult standing but this was not a good film at all. sorry ladies and gentlemen. though i own it you go ahead and enjoy it not me.

as i understand it tommy wiseau at least in greg sestero’s book had actually not been a nice person to his cast in fact he’d actually been quite abusive so those whom are actually on his side you have to wonder at their sense of morality in believing this film was remotely good. i guess i’d say this was one of those films where tommy had the money to buy his film haters the ones that find it just that enjoyable to hate movie goers.

i understand that he, tommy wiseau, probably took the films he knew growing up which probably had more to do with those soft core roughies you saw at the peepshows after midnight but ladies and gentlemen i’m not into belly porn… enjoy the film if you must just don’t lie and say it was a great film…

three positives that i can say about the film is i loved that beginning shot of that cool looking architecture, the part where the friends have fucked and dude comes back for his underwear and i guess the fact that all the lines are quotable in the same accent that tommy has.

starring tommy wiseau as johnny, greg sestero as mark, juliette danielle as lisa, philip haldiman as denny (as phillip haldiman), carilyn minnott as claudette (as carolyn minnot) robyn paris as michelle, mike holmes as mike (as mike scott), dan janjigian as chris-r, kyle vogt as peter, greg ellery as steven, kari mcdermott as party member #2 (as kari mcdermont), jennifer vanderbliek as party member #3 (as jen vanderbliek), daron jennings as barista #2, frank willey as coffeshop #4, bennett dunn as partygoer (as bennet dunn).",low

the quality and cinematography are simply brilliant in this film. there are so many amazing shots and sequences that just had me completely enamored. these films are ahead of their time for sure.

harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban has the best plot of the series so far. there is a constant threat looming in the background throughout the entire film that is known from the opening minutes. sirius black's menacing posters and headlines create a real sense of danger, and he truly seems mad. the dementors also deliver a serious threat on screen. their introduction is terrifying, and their presence is felt in every scene.

one of my favorite things about this film is the conclusion, the time traveling elements are perfect and answer so many questions that i had when running through the finale the first time. my fiancé and i were very confused at how things were happening, and i was having a hard time believing it. but it was brilliant the way it looped around, and the audience was given more background information that made those scenes complete.

the trio of daniel radcliffe, emma watson, and rupert grint elevate their performances once again. their chemistry is amazing, and i have a feeling this complement will be handed out during every film until the conclusion. gary oldman was fantastic as sirius black and one of the more compelling ""villains"" of the series so far. michael gambon does an excellent job filling in for the late richard harris, it was really difficult to even tell that it was a different actor.

my only complaint about this film was the beginning of the movie was slightly rushed. i felt like from when harry left the dursley's to when he arrived at hogwarts the audience was whipped around from location to location, and it was hard to keep track of why. but the plot settles in and finds it's groove after that and delivers a near perfect conclusion.

782,"he is the irrepressible spirit of youth.

under pressure due to his success, in a token socialite marriage, playwright j.m. barrie is less than enamoured with his lot. then whilst out walking his dog in kensington gardens, he meets widowed sylvia llewelyn davies and her four young sons, george, jack, peter and michael. it is the start of a long lasting friendship that revitalises barrie and brings about his masterpiece, peter pan.

ok, lets get the grumble out the way, you know the one, the one that so many are quick to mention. no this is not a definitive take on j.m. barrie and this time in his life. much like allan knee's play, ""the man who was peter pan"", from which this is adapted, there are liberties taken and it's most definitely chronologically unsound.

but this is not a biography is it? this is basically asking what sort of man conceived the magical world of peter pan? it's a celebration of childhood, life, whimsically asking us if it's wrong to keep the inner child in us all locked away as adulthood takes control? a tale of comedy blended with tragedy, from which glorious art is born to live long and forever, the kind that will be touching generations long after we have left this mortal coil.

elegantly crafted by director marc forster and his screenwriter david magee, finding neverland could so easily have given way to over sentiment and floundered in the search for emotional kickers. yet it doesn't because forster (immeasurably aided by the lush cinematography by roberto schafer) has created a quaint victorian world, a world where fantasy is never far away. what emotion is here (and there is lots of it) sits perfect within this setting. we are actually being asked to be barrie himself, the makers daring us to not be swept up in the magic being born. wonderful, wonderful stuff.

johnny depp is perfectly cast as barrie, delicately fusing childish playfulness with inner sorrow, depp doesn't put a foot wrong. it will be a crime if this multi talented actor doesn't finish his career with the highest acting honour on offer, the academy award for best actor (nominated three times, including this performance), it's practically impossible to imagine another actor in this generation nailing the role of barrie like depp does. playing off him expertly is kate winslet as sylvia, raw and honest like, it's emotionally driven and gnaws away at the audience's heart strings. yet it's young freddie highmore as peter that steals the show. very much the film's heart, his relationship with barrie has a grace about it, with highmore (just 12 at the time) able to portray a subtle tenderness that drives the relationship forward.

nominated for seven academy awards (including best picture), finding neverland won just the one for jan kaczmarek's poignant score. it matters not, because to me at least, this will forever be a personal favourite film. something that just like peter pan himself, will never ever get old. 10/10",high
784,"**superheroes anonymous**

tragically i am a batman. an obsessive caped crusader comic-book collector until 1972 when my evil mother tossed the entire bunch in the garbage. my cousin was spider-man. his noble mother preserved his collection with plastic envelopes and to this day they remain in pristine condition. 

what's truly tragic about being a batman is that, despite nolan's recent attempts (and questionable sincerity), the best batman movie hasn't been made yet. as far as we know, with batman's fate resting with warner bros, david goyer, zak snider and ben affleck, the best batman movie will not be possible for another decade or two, maybe three. i await thee dark knight.

again to my cousin's good fortune, the best movie about spider-man has been established for quite some time. in fact, as a benchmark, it is arguably the best comic-book super-hero movie ever made. i didn't much love sam raimi's first spider-man, and wished my mother could have disposed of his last entry, but _spider-man 2_ was, and is, the ultimate movie adaptation from comic-books to the movie screen. 

i was living in shanghai in the summer of 2004 where i had to commute 3 hours on a hot and dizzy day to see it in english, and was fully rewarded for the effort. i was thrust into a imaginary super-hero world far more pleasing than anything i could remember since childhood. the 3 hour commute back home seemed like a breeze because spider-man 2 awoke the wonder-struck boy inside me. it reminded me of a happy youth i forgot i had. it felt like spidey was on the subway with me and would protect me from any harm. and he was just a boy himself! batman? who's that?

for a super-hero story, nearly everything is perfect in this movie. doc ock couldn't have been better. he looked exactly the way he did, at the height of stan lee's eminence, in the brightly coloured panels fighting spider-man in 1968. and sounded just like i imagined he would. peter and mary jane were in their element and their friendship and romantic undertaking actually mattered. the story and action played out the way a comic book should. it was both intimate and fantastic. trippy, wonderful and scary. it was like growing up all over again. the climax was a bit too flashy, loud and over-the-top at that time, but by today's standards, when compared to climactic train-wrecks in _man of steel_, _iron man 3_ and _the avengers_, it's perfectly splendid.

we are now being helplessly bombarded with comic book movies attacking us from every direction, all of them trying to out-do each other, jumping one shark after another. every marginal superhero from dr strange to shazam is being dusted off and hurled onto the big screen for our insatiable happy-childhood-appeasing appetite. the marvel of disney is launching at us one theme-park roller-coaster ride after another. sony, with their amazing spider-man abominations, has completely lost it. fox's x-men and fantastic four proliferations hit the wall long ago. and dc, under the reigns of warner bros, has transfigured into its own worst enemy. a wretched mutation not even the joker finds amusing.

turns out sam raimi's _spider-man 2_ is the gold standard by which all comic-book movies, certainly those of the super-hero variety, are and, evidently, will be set. lucky cousin.",high
817,"i sort of watched them out of order. i wasn't really privy to the existence of the incredibles until my fiance wanted to rent the sequel...and then i went back and watched the first one.

i have to say that i liked 2 more, but only because it looked like a period pop art piece and the first one you really didn't get that feel. it was clearly set in the early 60s, but you didn't get that whole esthetic as much as you did in the sequel and that was the biggest draw i had to it.

that being said, it was't bad.

sociopolitically i liked the line about when everyone has super powers no one does. it registered loudly to someone that works in history. so the plot, on that basis, was compelling.

and i am sure that if i had seen them in order i'd like it just as much.

the sequel, the main draw that sucked me in was the look of the film. here it was the quasi-family struggles which, again, seemed to be highlighted a little better in the second film. still, it was there enough, the work-life balance to draw you in, and the absurdity that the work was being a hero was entertaining.

as was the reason they had to go underground which, again, was done a little better than when the mcu tried it...but still not elaborated on enough to make it as interesting as it could have once been.

in any case, it's still an entertaining cartoon. and you can see where the creators took what worked in the first one and elaborated on the concepts until they popped.",high

830,"_**confused comedic remake of the original 1975 film**_

a couple (nicole kidman & matthew broderick) moves from the big apple to stepford, connecticut, where many of the wives of the village are wholly dedicated to their husbands, home & garden and keeping themselves well-groomed and primed for sex. the husband joins the mysterious all-male organization of the town which seems to be up to something fishy. bette midler plays joanna’s best friend while glenn close & christopher walken are on hand as high society leaders.

“the stepford wives” (2004) is a confused comedic remake of the iconic 1975 film. it starts out like it might be a fun farce, and it is to some degree, but it’s hindered by an annoying stereotypical “gay” character and doomed by befuddled writing, the result of bad-management wherein rewrites and reshoots ruined the story's continuity and created plot holes. 

the most glaring example is the implication that the wives are replaced by robots; for instance, one woman is used as an atm machine. at the end, however, joanna (kidman) discovers they've just been brainwashed by microchips inserted in their brains. if the latter is true, why was there an android version of joanna? do the men have a choice of a robot model or a human-with-a-microchip model? do they choose “accessories”? it’s never elucidated. 

the film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes, and was shot in connecticut and new york/new jersey.

842,"***""where does it end?"" -- ""it never ends.""***

if homer's mythical epic ""the iliad"" is based on a factual story, that story is magnificently depicted in wolfgang petersen's 2004 epic ""troy."" in other words, don't expect any goofy 'gods' or 'goddesses' like athena popping out of thin air because ""troy"" is a realistic portrayal of the trojan war.

more than that, ""troy"" is arguably the best sword & sandal epic ever put to film. you name the picture -- ""samson and delilah,"" ""spartacus,"" ""ben-hur,"" ""ulysses,"" ""the viking queen,"" “conan the barbarian,” ""braveheart,"" ""attila,"" ""the odyssey,"" ""gladiator,"" etc. -- ""troy"" is superior. at the very least it’s as good as some of the better flicks just noted, like ""ben-hur,"" and far edges out ""spartacus"" and ""samson and delilah."" as for more recent sword & sandal epics, like the overrated ""braveheart"" or ""gladiator,"" ""troy"" blows 'em out of the water. 

roger ebert is a great writer and critic, but his mediocre review of ""troy"" is all wrong. ebert's major criticisms, believe it or not, are the main reasons i have such high respect for this film: he complains that petersen omitted the many greek 'gods' & 'goddesses' and gripes that the actors perform their roles as believable people and not larger-than-life caricatures. this can, of course, be respectably done, as in the 1955 film ""ulysses,"" but this is not what petersen was shooting for in ""troy."" his goal, as already noted, was to depict the actual trojan war on which homer's myth is based. (even if it never really took place, wars like it did).

regarding brad pitt's heavily criticized performance as achilles, i couldn’t care less about pitt until seeing this movie as he does an outstanding job portraying greece's greatest warrior. no, he's not the bulkiest warrior to ever grace the earth, but he's fast as lightning, confident, expertly skilled and deadly accurate. even his voice completely fits the role. eric bana (from ""hulk"") is also great as hector, achilles' trojan counterpart, who's sick of war and just wants to live a life of peace with his family. these two have a showdown in the film and it is without a doubt the greatest mano-a-mano sword & sandal duel ever filmed.

what's interesting about the picture is that you never really end up rooting for one side or the other. when achilles and hector have their powerful face-off, my wife and i couldn't decide for whom to root. maybe that's the point. don't get me wrong, agamemnon could be viewed as the villain in this picture, and i wasn't rooting for menelaus when he fights paris (orlando bloom, who seduces helen, menelaus' wife), but neither the greeks nor the trojans are painted as the 'good guys' or 'bad guys.' they're just people at war, and in war there's no real glory, as hector points out... and it never ends, as achilles states. an additional point is that living in a state of war is a joyless existence. and both bana and pitt get this across well.

as for beautiful women, there are only a couple mentionable: diane kruger plays helen, ""the face that launched a thousand ships."" some have complained that she's too plain for the role, but i disagree. i’m not a fan of hers or anything, but she looks pretty dang sharp to me (not to mention has an impressive behind shot). besides, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. if paris deems her worthy of starting a war, who are we to disagree? also on hand is cutie rose byrne who plays briseis, the virgin priestess whom achilles converts to the pleasures of the flesh.

i should point out that ""troy"" was one of the most expensive pictures ever made at the time and it definitely shows on the screen. make no mistake, ""troy"" is breath-taking just to watch -- the colossal armies, ships and battles are awe-inspiring to behold, not to mention the maltan and mexican locations. and the cgi effects are outstanding for the time, not fake-looking like the rome & coliseum scenes in ""gladiator."" 

another complaint by ebert is that the dialogue is lousy; nothing could be further from the truth. there are great pieces of dialogue interspersed throughout, including achilles' comment that the 'gods' envy people because we're mortal and ""everything's beautiful because we're doomed."" thankfully, there's not one goofy one-liner anywhere to be found.

james horner's score should also be mentioned. if you enjoyed the soundtrack of ""the passion of the christ"" you'll love this one because it's just as good/serious/reverent/powerful. for instance, the intense percussion during achilles and hector's showdown is magnificent.

interestingly, brad pitt, who plays achilles, injured his achilles tendon during shooting. fitting, no? 

final word: if you're in the mood for a sword & sandal epic, ""troy"" more than fills the bill. the story captivates from the get-to and never lets up the entire 2.5 hour runtime (technically 2 hours, 42 minutes, with credits). it extravagantly visualizes the trojan war for you, something i never did until seeing this mind-blowing, outstanding piece of cinema.

this and fury stick out on pitt's resume as his masterpieces thus far.
here, we have the most ""credible"" and ""least hollywood"" look at the iliad and the trojan war. 
the characters are very likely as they were, if they really existed, with motivations explained quite well, save for one motivation.
it is hard to see achilles as someone who tells a kid that living dangerously will make you famous a thousand years into the future. even if achilles is that introspective, it's hard to see that point of view being something someone would believe in, especially in an ancient world where few names are remembered after death, and certainly not for thousands of years.
aside from that, we get very credible explanations for all the recorded events, without the brown nosing of homer, although the brown nosing of odysseus still exists even in this story.

ocean's 11 was a slick movie, ultra cool and up there with the best as regards superior remakes. ocean's twelve is a waste, a film coasting on star appeal, a picture desperately trying to cram as much into its screenplay for fear of failing.

the plot shoots off in a number of directions, yet incredibly it still wastes most of the cast who have all been held over from ocean's 11. this time catherine zeta-jones joins in for some weighty dressage and vincent cassel is along as some sort of break-dancing raffles dude. there's the odd in-joke that works, while the by-ply between the principal players (clooney/pitt/damon) holds a modicum of entertainment value. however, once the dust settles on the myriad of schemes and scrapes, you are left with a sequel of a remake that is almost everything the other film was not. boo. 4/10",low

902,"blade: trinity completes the blade trilogy in cinematic grandeur, and brings about dracula, an inevitable source in almost every vampire franchise ever conceived of.

it was refreshing to have the ""elder"" ruling-class/vampire-nation-lord/shadow-council thing dropped, since they were in both blade and blade ii, and in both movies they were completely killed off, and ignored the existence of each other. instead we have a group of happy-go-lucky vamps, who have one way or another made a mark in the world. you never find out how they managed to buy a skyscraper and a museum's worth of ancient art, but i'd imagine they had quite a lot of time to get their finances in order.

anyway, deal is these vamps, right? danica talos (posey ""queen of the indies"" parker; scream 3, a mighty wind), her brother asher talos (callum keith rennie; case 39, the x-files: i want to believe), jarko grimwood (wrestler paul ""triple h"" levesque), and their offsider vampires go to syria in order to dig up the slumbering dracula (dominic purcell; straw dogs, blood creek)... or drake... or dagon... they keep changing their mind. anyway, after dracula kills a bunch of them, he eventually agrees to join the team after he hears about the defender of humanity blade (wesley snipes; new jack city, chaos) whom he believes may be a worthy adversary. blade in turn gets together with the vampire hunting cell called ""nightstalkers"", led by abigail whistler (jessica biel; the the texas chainsaw massacre, cellular) and hannibal king (ryan reynolds; waiting..., buried) and together they continue the war for humankind.

with me so far? no? well you should be, because this plot is about as run of the mill as they get. while i'm on that, it's worth pointing out that where blade's saving grace was this awesome mythos and story, and totally failed at character-ing, blade: trinity had fantastically written characters, in a sort of non-event storyline. where blade ii blended them, making it the best in the series. trinity was okay, but it lacked a lot of the engaging elements from the previous two films.

i think in part this is because the film is meant to sort of cater to the cinema audience. after the success of blade ii, it's like they knew that people were going to go to the theatre for trinity so they tailored the film accordingly. you know, just little things, cheesy lines come across in a way more badass way on the big screen. montages can get tedious on the computer, but can often blow you away in theatres. explosions and action and cg backflips always translate better in cinema than on dvd. unfortunately, i own the dvd, not a cinema. maybe the goddamn vampire pomeranian they threw in would've seemed less ridiculous if i'd seen trinity when it came out in theatres, but i doubt it.

i'd like to bring up the issue of names. not that people have unbelievably crazy names in these films, it's the' super hero genre after all, of course they've got stupid names! i love it! but the blade series seems to be populated entirely by characters with the ""saying names"" fetish. it's all ""hannibal king! die"", ""blade! there you are"", ""whistler! come save us."" ""drake! it's him"" and gets pretty unbelievably dramatic rather swiftly.

it'll be interesting to see how ryan reynolds fairs. this marvel film came out quite a while ago, since then he's played wade wilson in origins: wolverine, green lantern for dc films, he was the protagonist in r.i.p.d. he's set to return to the x-men universe for deadpool. i suppose if chris evans can get away with playing the human torch in fantastic 4 and rise of the silver surfer then move on to playing captain america in the first avenger i don't see why reynolds can't pull it off. hannibal was great, ryan reynolds is great but i'd be fine to see this be the end of it all here.

i should be able to recommend this just based on ""tom hanks trapped in an airport"", especially given how popular ""cast away"" was.

the progression of hanks' character is wonderful, and while there are definitely components of this being a romantic movie, it is refreshing to see a movie that can hold the character's romantic motivations in parallel to the story's motivations and allow them to both be and be separate.

stanley tucci also does a great job, though its as a very unnecessary villain.  yes, it's a guy doing his job, but the character is oddly motivated for someone trying to score a promotion: something they specifically point out in the movie.

granted, if you're not a zombie fan, you're probably not even considering this one.  then you have the great argument about infection vectors (this is pretty classic, bite infection transfer), and slow vs fast (this movie is fast) zombies.  i'm basically just pointing out why we can't have nice things, people argue about it.

this has a great cast: ving rhames, sarah polley and jake weber in particular.  the production value was definitely present, and not just in renting a mall to trash, or even just the zombie practical effects.

the large scale scenes look amazing, and the details on the various infections are fascinating to watch.  and sure, there is lots of quality gunfire (foley is good) and shooting zombies for people you are just in it for the action.  while it's actually got some good (if dark at times) humor to it, it's not ""warm bodies"".

of course the presence of zombies / apocalyptic situation / lack of central authority gives us great philosophical opportunity to discuss what life means and see how people behave, but this leans more towards survival strategy aspects.

if anything, i think that is where the ""flaw"" is in this movie: (most of) the characters are relatively competent so it detours some from typical movie formula relying on the characters to make mistakes to progress the story, but more of there is just a hopeless unending storm of bad things happening to them, it's honestly a little refreshing.

948,"based on the 1966 film of the same name (and, in turn the 1963 stage play), 2004's _alfie_ stars jude law as a british commitment-shy play boy in manhattan.

much like the original film, alfie finds himself surrounded by beautiful women with a different one to jump into bed with each night. he treats both them and his friends like dirt, but doesn't care when he knows his charm can replace them.

if the original film contained a plot that would make the world blush when looked through a contemporary lens, then 2004's _alfie_ attempts, in a way, to update that story for its modern audience.

as is typical with remakes of old british films, the location has been moved to appease its american audience but a tacit nod to the cockney charm of _alfie_'s original actor (michael caine) in the form of jude law.

to his credit, jude law does emanate charm in the same way that caine did in 1966, mercilessly moving on from one relationship to the next without worry about consequence. however, with alfie remaining english in new york, this has the unfortunate effect of making him stand out, and when a protagonist is clearly designed not to be likeable, then by having him contrast from the surrounding cast just alienates him further.

in addition, with the persistent nods to high fashion, alfie isn't even relatable for most people as ""that laddish friend"" they once knew, and he comes across as both pompous and arrogant.

the story lifts large parts of the original, but seems to drop many of the subtle links between alfie's relationships making him appear far more crass. retained is alfie's smoking habit, which is out of place in a modern film made all the worse by the inexplicable removal of why smoking was relevant to the original story.

950,"_**provocative psychological drama**_

peoples of differing ethnicities and social-economic levels 'crash' into each other in los angeles over a day or so at christmas time. these people include: 

a white cop who's angry over the downside of affirmative action and so abuses his authority (matt dillon); his young white partner who objects to the abuse and actively tries to counteract it (ryan phillipe); a black tv director who feels emasculated over the racism he experiences and ultimately blows up (terrence howard); his light-skinned wife who doesn't know when to shutteth up (thandie newton); an hispanic locksmith (michael peña) and his young daughter with an ‘impenetrable invisible cloak’; a persian shopkeeper who needs a scapegoat after his store is horribly vandalized, not to mention his daughter and wife; two black car thieves (ludacris and larenz tate), the latter the younger brother of a detective, graham (don cheadle); graham's beautiful partner and girlfriend, ria (jennifer esposito), and her mother, a maid to the district attorney (brendan fraser) and his wife (sandra bullock); an asian man who’s hospitalized and his frantic wife racing to see whether he's alive or dead. 

""crash"" is reminiscent of another l.a. drama, the 1991 masterpiece ""grand canyon,"" but has enough nuances to stand on its own. for one thing, ""crash"" is even more serious and dark. 

this is an involved story with several interwoven story lines; it ain't no mindless popcorn 'blockbuster.' a casual viewing won't cut it. it's not that kind of picture. most of the negative criticisms about the film are by people who didn't watch closely and then lambaste it with criticisms that aren't even legitimate.

for one thing, the film is about more than racism; it's about stereotypes, hypocrites, abuse of power, the capacity for good or bad in every human soul, second chances, passive correction and shame, self-sacrifice, redemption, forgiveness, the last straw, manhood & emasculation, giving someone a break, true friendship, misunderstandings, favoritism and more. 

*** spoiler alert *** 

not every character is racist as some critics insist. brendan fraser's character never shows any racism and the only reason his wife (bullock) blows up with racially-charged statements concerning the locksmith is because she just got robbed and shoved to the pavement at gunpoint by two young black guys. how would you or i react after such an experience? also, the cop partner of matt dillon's character never displays racism in the truest sense; why else would he radically come to the defense of the director who has a fit or pick up a young black male hitchhiking? (what happens later is a misunderstanding not real racism). what about the detectives graham & ria and ria's housemaid mother? (yes, graham makes one derogatory statement about hispanics, but that's it; he's hardly racist). these are all main characters. 

then there's the criticism that all the protagonists are ""essentially one-dimensional racial stereotypes."" this is completely untrue. graham and ria (black and latino) are successful detectives; cameron is a successful black tv director; and the hispanic locksmith is a family-oriented working man, not a criminal or gangbanger. yes, there are some people who fit the stereotypes, like the two young black male thieves and the racist/abusive white cop, but one of the thieves becomes shamed for his lifestyle & hypocrisy and the racist cop is willing to risk his life for a woman of color, thus redeeming himself (from the guilt he felt over abusing his power the night before), besides his white partner is anything but a white racist who abuses his authority.

one critic criticized the film with this multiple-choice question: ""you are involved in a car accident on a busy street. the other driver is asian. do you: (a) wait for the police to arrive and see if the other driver is okay; (b) exchange insurance information with the other driver; (c) scream and yell, ""damn chinks don't know how to drive!"" 

""if you picked ‘c’ you'd love crash."" 

this car-crash scenario does take place in the story, but he's leaving out some important details: a woman & man are rear-ended by an asian lady. why don't they call the cops? because they are cops and there are other cops on the scene. why does the lady detective talk back to the asian woman? because the latter is having a fit and throwing racial slurs at her. this is why she talks back to the asian woman, not to mention she's a cop and therefore in a position of authority. why does the asian woman have a fit anyway? because she's rushing to the hospital to see if her husband's alive. so, you see, the witty little multiple-choice question doesn't actually fit the reality of the film. 

*** end spoiler *** 

another criticism is that the racism in the story is not subtle like it is in real life. well, haven't you ever seen anyone blow up like in the movie? i have. in a city as big as l.a. how many such blow ups happen over any 36-hour period? 

there's a lot of raw emotion and hard-to-watch scenes, but there are undeniable glimpses of love, hope, redemption and forgiveness as well. if you're in the mood for a well-made psychological drama with numerous insights to the human condition, don't miss out.

the film runs 1 hour, 54 minutes, and was shot in the los angeles area.

with a considerable amount of cash saved from his, ahem, dealings. a london drug dealer is all set to retire abroad and start a new life. however his mob boss jimmy price has two jobs for him to do immediately...

layer cake is directed by matthew vaughn. vaughn is more well known as guy ritchie's producer on his early british gangster genre forays. suffice to say he had some insight into what made those films {snatch et al} hugely popular with the watching british public. how pleasing it is then to say that vaughn, by showing restraint and an unfussy approach, has crafted a film that's more than equal to the best of britain gangster faves, and actually sets new parameters for toning a film. by focusing more on mood and atmosphere over bombastic scenarios, vaughn, aided by a superlative daniel craig as the nameless dealer, lifts the film above its conventional plot arc. in what could have been a standard tale of a man doing one last job before going straight, we, along with craig, find that all roads are blocked, it's as if there is some higher force at work here.

layer cake also scores high for its more easy on the eye filming of london, this is no destitute capital where tower blocks loom like monsters over the characters. this london is thriving, vim and vitality, the place to be, seediness is far from the ebullient crowd. ben davis' photography perfectly complimenting the engrossing score from lisa gerrard & ilan eshkeri, both of which serve to make london an extra character in the story. the film however is not perfect, at 105 minutes it's actually too short, something that only becomes apparent when all the plot strands come crashing together in a rushed last quarter. yet in spite of that failing, the ending delivers a jolt to the system, to crown, what to me at least, is one of britain's finest and tidiest gangster offerings. 9/10",high

966,"well, you wonder, how dangerous could the ""graveyard"" be if clark survived it solo for 15 years? then word of mavericks gets around, and legendary surfers from hawaii's north shore come to visit. one of the sport's champions, mark foo, is killed after wiping out on a medium wave. one theory is that the tether to his board got caught on rocks and he drowned. another surfer thinks he felt or sensed somebody under the water who shouldn't have been there. exactly one year later, during a memorial to foo, another surfer is drowned.

the documentary ""riding giants"" shows surfers gathered to discuss and mourn the lost men. it does not show jeff clark during those previous 15 years because, of course, he was alone. and what a species of aloneness it was, to plunge into the cold ocean and swim out 45 minutes for a few seconds of exhilaration at the risk of your life. clark and his kind live at the intersection of courage, madness, skill and obsession.

consider laird hamilton, the current golden boy of the sport, who has cashed in with endorsement contracts, modeling assignments and magazine covers. but no, i am not comparing him unfavorably to clark, because hamilton is also a superb athlete and a driven man. hanging around as a kid with hawaii's big wave riders of the 1960s, he introduced his divorced mom to one of them, who became his stepfather and tutor; laird grew up to become surfing's first superstar.

what hamilton has done is go farther from land than any rider had thought to go, seeking ""remote offshore reefs capable of producing unimaginable waves."" at first this involved paddling two hours and then waiting up to two hours for a wave. then hamilton invents ""towing surfing,"" in which a jet ski tows him out to the far reefs, and slingshots him onto waves moving so fast it is impossible to access them any other way.

the jet ski driver's other job is to pick up hamilton again after the ride, or be prepared to rescue him. the current thriller ""open water"" shows a couple lost at sea after being left behind on a scuba-diving tour. for hamilton, being lost at sea is a possibility several times a day. ""riding giants"" was directed by stacy peralta, whose ""dogtown and z-boys"" (2002) documented the invention and culture of southern california skateboarding. in both films his archival work is the key; he seems to have access to limitless historical footage, sometimes in home movie form; we see hamilton at the dawn of towing surfing, when at first it was scorned and then embraced by the sport's champions.

in august 2000, hamilton goes to tahiti in search of a legendary wave so big it is ""a freak of hydroponics."" he finds it and rides it, and we see him precariously balanced on its terrifying immensity in what the movie calls ""the most significant ride in surfing history."" other surfers, providing voiceover commentary, say the wave's characteristics were so different from ordinary waves that hamilton had to improvise new techniques, some of them violating years of surfing theory and instinct, right there on the wave.

what a long time it seems since that summer of 1967, when i sat in a chicago beer garden with the suntanned and cheerful bruce brown. he'd just made a documentary named ""the endless summer,"" and was touring the country with it, at the moment when surfing was exploding (there were 5,000 surfers in 1959, 2 million today). for brown, surfing was a lark. with a $50,000 budget, he followed two surfers on an odyssey that led to senegal, ghana, south africa, australia, new zealand, tahiti and hawaii. they were searching for the ""perfect wave,"" and found it off durban, south africa: ""a 4-foot curl that gave rides of 15 minutes and came in so steadily it looked like it was made by a machine.""

a 4-foot curl? hamilton and his contemporaries challenge waves of 60 or 70 feet. ""the endless summer"" charts a world of beaches and babes, brews and beach boys songs, and surfers who live to ""get stoked."" in ""riding giants"" the sport is more like an endless winter -- solitary and dangerous. even as brown was making ""the endless summer,"" modern surfing was being invented by pioneers like greg noll of hawaii, who ventured 15 miles up the coast from honolulu to waimea bay. it was thought to be unsurfable; a surfer asks himself, ""can the human body survive the wipeout?"" it could. the discovery of the north shore of oahu, the movie says, ""was surfing's equivalent of columbus discovering the new world.""

more vintage footage. the ""storm of the century"" descends upon hawaii, and noll, known as ""the bull,"" determines to surf it. his chances of surviving are rated at 50/50 by the movie, at zero by any reasonable person watching it. he survived. it was ""the biggest wave ever ridden"" -- until, perhaps, the monster that hamilton found off tahiti, too big to be measured.

after bruce brown finds his perfect wave in ""the endless summer,"" he marvels: ""the odds against a wave like this are 20 million to one!"" the odds that laird hamilton could get stoked on a 4-foot curl are higher than that. before seeing ""riding giants,"" my ideas about surfing were formed by the gidget movies, ""the endless summer,"" the beach boys, elvis and lots of tv commercials. ""surfin' safari"" was actually running through my head on the way into the screening.

""riding giants"" is about altogether another reality. the overarching fact about these surfers is the degree of their obsession. they live to ride, and grow depressed when there are no waves. they haunt the edge of the sea like the mariners melville describes on the first pages of moby dick. they seek the rush of those moments when they balance on top of a wave's fury and feel themselves in precarious harmony with the ungovernable force of the ocean. they are cold and tired, battered by waves, thrown against rocks, visited by sharks, held under so long they believe they are drowning -- and over and over, year after year, they go back into the sea to do it again.",high
971,"the grudge begrudgingly latches onto croaky jump scares without logical cohesion. this, is an unusual horror to review. it’s rather uncommon for the same director, in this case takashi shimizu, to remake his own original film for an entirely different audience. most would push their original creation onto the masses and convince them, with glorified persuasion, to withstand subtitles and invest the time into the chilling ghost story.

yet shimizu thought it would be apt to direct his own film again. admirable? yes, it ensured he received total creative control over the studio and producers. necessary? no. somehow, by remaking the exact story with essentially the same spine-tingling sequences, shimizu downgraded the atmospheric aura of ‘ju-on’, resulting in nothing more than a japanese ghost boy releasing his inner cat and his ethereal mother croaking the life out of anyone who visits the cursed house. that’s the plot synopsis, right there.

well, there’s a tad bit more to the mystery, however shimizu’s insistence on haphazardly fracturing the narrative between present day and the past week consequently confused audiences rather than enthral. there’s no logic behind the structure. no foundational development. and certainly no characterisation. so the abrupt switching back and forth held no purpose, other than to illustrate a host of jumpy death sequences. some effective apparitional imagery heightened the tension, particularly the surveillance footage sequence and bedroom scene that made me frightened of my own bloody duvet when i was an innocent boy, yet negated by the bland acting from every single actor.

buffy has no more vampires to slay or daphne has solved all remaining mysteries (take your pick...), and so she’s left wandering aimlessly around tokyo with just one facial expression. confusion. pullman contributed nothing. and even kayako herself, fuji, was grossly misused during moments of tension-raising buildup. the final expositional flashback sequence, revealing to us why the house is now essentially cursed, was rushed and overwrought. then concluding the entire feature on a frickin’ jump scare that looked cheaper than kayako’s mascara. by the time the credits roll, you’ll be thinking to yourself “...why are these americans in tokyo anyway?”.

i just...don’t understand how shimizu can make his remake so unprogressive in terms of quality. he had another shot at bettering his original, overcoming previous criticisms, yet failed miserably. i’m open to the idea that the grudge is a product of its time, comprising of several horror traits that the previous decade had commonly exploited. and i appreciate it stuck to its j-horror roots. but damn, this has not aged well in the slightest. the core is there. i can visibly see the contents. yet, either due to shimizu’s inability to improve in directorial control or studio interference, the grudge growled like a ghoulish kitten instead of exhuming a ghostly lion’s roar. y’know, because toshio opens his cgi mouth and a cat noise comes out? urgh, whatever. couldn’t think of anything...",low

985,"george lucas comes full circle in more ways than one in ""star wars: episode iii -- revenge of the sith,"" which is the sixth -- and allegedly but not necessarily the last -- of the ""star wars"" movies. after ""episode ii"" got so bogged down in politics that it played like the republic covered by c-span, ""episode iii"" is a return to the classic space opera style that launched the series. because the story leads up to where the original ""star wars"" began, we get to use the immemorial movie phrase, ""this is where we came in.""

that anakin skywalker abandoned the jedi and went over to the dark side is known to all students of ""star wars."" that his twins luke skywalker and princess leia would redeem the family name is also known. what we discover in ""episode iii"" is how and why anakin lost his way -- how a pleasant and brave young man was transformed into a dark, cloaked figure with a fearsome black metal face. as yoda sadly puts it in his inimitable word order: ""the boy you trained, gone he is, consumed by darth vader.""

as ""episode iii"" opens, anakin skywalker (hayden christensen) and his friend obi-wan kenobi (ewan mcgregor) are piloting fighter craft, staging a daring two-man raid to rescue chancellor palpatine (ian mcdiarmid). he has been captured by the rebel gen. grievous (whose voice, by matthew woods, sounds curiously wheezy considering the general seems to use replacement parts). in the spirit of all the ""star wars"" movies, this rescue sequence flies in the face of logic, since the two pilots are able to board grievous' command ship and proceed without much trouble to the ship's observation tower, where the chancellor is being held. there is a close call in an elevator shaft, but where are the guards and the security systems? and why, for that matter, does a deep space cruiser need an observation tower, when every porthole opens on to the universe? but never mind.

back within the sphere of the jedi council, anakin finds that despite his heroism, he will not yet be named a jedi master. the council distrusts palpatine and wants anakin to spy on him; palpatine wants anakin to spy on the council. who to choose? mcdiarmid has the most complex role in the movie as he plays on anakin's wounded ego. anakin is tempted to go over to what is not yet clearly the dark side; in a movie not distinguished for its dialogue, palpatine is insidiously snaky in his persuasiveness.

the way anakin approaches his choice, however, has a certain poignancy. anakin has a rendezvous with padme (natalie portman); they were secretly married in the previous film, and now she reveals she is pregnant. his reaction is that of a nice kid in a teenage comedy, trying to seem pleased while wondering how this will affect the other neat stuff he gets to do. to say that george lucas cannot write a love scene is an understatement; greeting cards have expressed more passion.

the dialogue throughout the movie is once again its weakest point: the characters talk in what sounds like basic english, without color, wit or verbal delight, as if they were channeling berlitz. the exceptions are palpatine and of course yoda, whose speech (voiced by frank oz) reminds me of wolcott gibbs' famous line about the early style of time magazine: ""backward ran sentences until reeled the mind.""

in many cases the actors are being filmed in front of blue screens, with effects to be added later, and sometimes their readings are so flat, they don't seem to believe they're really in the middle of amazing events. how can you stand in front of exploding star fleets and sound as if you're talking on a cell phone at starbucks?

""he's worried about you,"" anakin is told at one point. ""you've been under a lot of stress."" sometimes the emphasis in sentences is misplaced. during the elevator adventure in the opening rescue, we hear ""did i miss something?"" when it should be ""did i miss something?""

the dialogue is not the point, however; lucas' characters engage in sturdy oratorical pronunciamentos and then leap into adventure. ""episode iii"" has more action per square minute, i'd guess, than any of the previous five movies, and it is spectacular. the special effects are more sophisticated than in the earlier movies, of course, but not necessarily more effective.

the dogfight between fighters in the original ""star wars"" and the dogfight that opens this one differ in their complexity (many more ships this time, more planes of action, more detailed backgrounds) but not in their excitement. and although lucas has his characters attend a futuristic opera that looks like a cross between cirque de soleil and an ultrasound scan of an unborn baby, if you regard the opera hall simply as a place, it's not as engaging as the saloon on tatooine in the first movie.

the lesson, i think, is that special effects should be judged not by their complexity but by the degree that they stimulate the imagination, and ""episode iii"" is distinguished not by how well the effects are done, but by how amazingly they are imagined. a climactic duel on a blazing volcanic planet is as impressive, in its line, as anything in ""lord of the rings."" and yoda, who began life as a muppet but is now completely animated (like about 70 percent of what we see onscreen), was to begin with and still is the most lifelike of the non-humanoid ""star wars"" characters.

a word, however, about the duels fought with lightsabers. when they flashed into life with a mighty whizzing thunk in the first ""star wars"" and whooshed through their deadly parabolas, that was exciting. but the thrill is gone.

the duelists are so well-matched that saber fights go on forever before anyone is wounded, and i am still not sure how the sabers seem able to shield their bearers from attack. when it comes to great movie sword fights, liam neeson and tim roth took home the gold medal in ""rob roy"" (1995), and the lightsaber battles in ""episode iii"" are more like isometrics.

these are all, however, more observations than criticisms. george lucas has achieved what few artists do; he has created and populated a world of his own. his ""star wars"" movies are among the most influential, both technically and commercially, ever made. and they are fun. if he got bogged down in solemnity and theory in ""episode ii: attack of the clones,"" the force is in a jollier mood this time, and ""revenge of the sith"" is a great entertainment.

note: i said this is not necessarily the last of the ""star wars"" movies. although lucas has absolutely said he is finished with the series, it is inconceivable to me that 20th century-fox will willingly abandon the franchise, especially as lucas has hinted that parts vii, viii and ix exist at least in his mind. there will be enormous pressure for them to be made, if not by him, then by his deputies.

our main cast is doing some of the best acting of the series, daniel radcliffe really raises his performance up a notch and establishes himself as the lead of the franchise. his acting is refined and mature and he does an excellent job portraying his emotions with not only his line delivery but his facial expressions and body language. he really broke through here and it was a joy to see. rupert grint and emma watson were great, but they had a slight decrease in screentime and really were sidelined during this film. the introduction of robert pattinson as cedric diggory brings an interesting dynamic to the story, as harry potter has somewhat of an older brother figure to contend with. the relationship and chemistry between the two builds and brings some emotionally heavy scenes throughout.

there is constant action in this film; from the opening scenes of the quidditch world cup to the multiple rounds of the tri-wizard tournament, there is always something happening, and it helps create a very steady pace throughout. not only is there action, but there is also fantastic character development. all of our characters really start to come into their own through the struggles they all face throughout the film. harry is the best he's ever been, and the new faces are great on screen. alastor moody is mysterious and quirky and is a great mentor to harry.

but the greatest thing about this film is the sinster introduction of lord voldemort. his presence was lurking in the background of the entire series, but here he is reborn in a horrifying way. ralph feinnes is superb in his only 6 minutes of screen time, but it is enough to leave a lasting impression. the ending is perfect and sets the tone of the franchise going forward.

watching through it, there is about an hour and a half that i would cut, mostly because it's not necessary for a movie like this. there was character development... but too much of it. there was plot, but too much of it.

i had seen <em>'the chronicles of narnia: the lion, the witch and the wardrobe'</em> before but hadn't watched it for years and years, i remembered the vast majority though - it's a memorable film after all. there's a great battle scene in there, some fun characters and strong effects. it's a tad too long, but not by much.

it has a nice charm to it also, as they set up narnia excellently. the quartet of children are very well cast, all four of them suit their roles to a t. georgie henley is sweet as lucy, while william moseley and anna popplewell fulfil the roles of peter and susan comfortably. edmund, meanwhile, is of course annoying, but skandar keynes does a good job portraying him.

elsewhere, tilda swinton and liam neeson are terrific casts as the white witch and aslan. both do great, especially swinton. james mcavoy, ray winstone, michael madsen and rupert everett are smart choices too.

i've, as far as i'm aware, never seen the two sequels so very much look forward to seeing what they have in store for me. they'll do well to match this first film, that's for sure.",high
1029,"in my last review (which you can find on my letterboxd), i said _the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe_ was a ""nearly perfect film."" well, i am here to say that with this viewing, to me, it is a perfect film. 

i used to always think this film was a sort of step below lotr, and, while lotr is indeed a masterpiece of cinema, i don't regard this film as lesser.

the movie is just pure magic! every aspect of the movie (minus the cgi – which doesn't really hold up [except for aslan] but is still serviceable) is even better with age! and i find myself moved emotionally by more things this time than i ever have watching this film.

the score by harry gregson-williams is just phenomenal. especially ""the battle"" – that goes without saying. but this time, part of the magic and nostalgia i was struck by was the musical piece that sounds like it's a song. the one that plays while the train is leaving london. (i found out it's actually about halfway into the track ""evacuating london."") that magical song, combined with the great camera work by donald m. mcalpine and the appearance of the movie title makes for feelings of peak nostalgia and magic for me.

also, this film has one of the best opening scenes of all time. when netflix (finally) remakes the films, i don't know how they can top this opening. 
– in fact, that's another thing about this movie: there are so many things that i don't think any remake could top. liam neeson as aslan, tilda swinton as jadis, the white witch, and james mcavoy as tumnus. – oh, and, though he's not in the book, the centaur, oreius (played by patrick kake), is so cool! can't top that.

also, the costuming is excellent – especially for the white witch – and the gryphons are so cool! the sound design on their shriek gives me chills (in a good way).

and i can't go without saying that this is also an emotional story because of what the story represents, the symbolism of the story.
edmund represents us – represents me, a sinner. i who have walked in rebellion against god, and who am by nature opposed to god. and as such, i deserve the wrath of god, punishment that he would be fully just to give me. but aslan represents jesus christ. like aslan sacrificed himself for edmund, dying the death he should have died, jesus sacrificed himself in our stead, taking upon himself the wrath of god we deserved, so that “if [we] confess with [our] mouth that jesus is lord and believe in [our] heart that god raised him from the dead, [we] will be saved” (romans 10:9), we “will not perish but have eternal life” (from john 3:16), and as a result of that faith, “we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ” (from romans 5:1).

‭‭ephesians‬ ‭2:1‭-‬10‬

> “[1] and you were dead in the trespasses and sins [2] in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience— [3] among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. [4] but god, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, [5] even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with christ—by grace you have been saved— [6] and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in christ jesus, [7] so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in christ jesus. [8] for by grace you have been saved through faith. and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of god, [9] not a result of works, so that no one may boast.

1041,"it's not who i am underneath, but what i do that defines me.

bruce wayne is constantly tortured by his childhood memories when he witnessed his parents being murdered. taken under the wing of the league of shadows, a deadly ninja assassin army devoted to erasing crime with their own brand of harsh justice. after completing training, wayne refuses to join them on account of not agreeing with their methods, he returns to gotham city to reek his own one man war against crime.

director christopher nolan literally goes back to batman origins to not just give the dead franchise a kiss of life, but actually to spark it into a sort of triumphant homecoming. gone is all forms of camp veneer so evident in joel schumacher's offerings, and in place we have a darkly rich picture intent on fleshing out batman's motives, and crucially, his fractured persona.

one of the most pleasing things to me was that nolan paced this picture to perfection, the build up of character, and then birth of the bat, dominates for practically the first hour of the piece. this gives batman begins some crucial heart, it really helps us to focus on this weird super-hero now that we have some meat on his bones. we then follow wayne from a chinese prison to the league of shadows monastery, watching his transformation from brawling man of anger into a controlled fighting machine. a machine that still roams with a revenge laden heart.

then its to gotham city where he then births batman and all bad guys are on his agenda. mob boss falcone, the mysterious scarecrow, and also a face from his past that rears its surprising head. wayne is driven by powerful motives, and it's here in the second part of the film that batman begins rewards those who indulged in the character build up. in come the stunts and outrageous sequences, all played out in nolan's desperately dank gotham city (a far cry from tim burton's dark oz like scapes). this gotham is pot boiling to disaster and is crying out for the bat to sweep all before it, and thankfully nolan and his cast fulfil all the early promise to deliver a wonderful action fantasy that caters for all ages.

christian bale dons the batsuit and it fits like a glove, his bruce wayne may lack the ebullient charisma that michael keaton's had, but his batman is mean and moody and comfortable with the zippy dialogue. michael caine plays alfred the loyal servant to the wayne family, much heart and emotive drive from caine ensures the role is a roaring success. cillian murphy is dr jonathan crane/scarecrow who actually scares more as crane with his piercing eyes and devilishly smirky leer, whilst both gary oldman (jim gordon) & morgan freeman (lucius fox) are solid with what little they actually have to do. liam neeson gets his teeth into a meaty role as henri ducard, and as a character arc he gets the best scenes (nolan clearly having great fun here).

minnor let downs to me without hurting the picture are katie holmes (pretty but hardly convincing as assistant d.a. rachael dawes) and rutger hauer as earle (a little bit of menace wouldn't go amiss here rutger old man). still, as i said they are very minor let downs because as comic book adaptations go, batman begins is from the top draw, a franchise re-suited, rebooted and completely reinvigorated. but now the test comes with that all important sequel... 9/10",high

1052,"it's literally like someone took america by the east coast and shook it, and all the normal girls managed to hang on.

kiss kiss bang bang is written and directed by shane black. it stars robert downey jr., val kilmer and michelle monaghan. music is by john ottman and cinematography by michael barrett. 

small time thief harry lockhart (downey jr.) is running from the police and stumbles into a movie audition and gets the part! partnered with private detective gay perry (kilmer), who is to show him the ropes for the part he's to play, things turn just a little weird when dead bodies start turning up in his life 

shane black's first venture into big feature film directing is a master class of genre bending bravado. the screenplay and script bare all the hallmarks of black, where anyone familiar with his writing work previously will know where to set expectation levels as per barbed dialogue and blitzkrieg energy. yet this is very much one of a kind, a standalone of such dizzying thrills and shameless awareness of movie conventions, it practically begs to be visited on more than one occasion. 

to simplify it, it's a neo-noir  murder mystery  bromance  romance  comedy  actioner! ok, so not really that simple, then! black takes a loving homage to pulp cinema and mixes it with caustic asides to the los angeles industry that provides him with work. how wonderful. downey's (fabulous) lockhart is the fulcrum, acting as antagonist, protagonist, narrator and a number of other things as black runs him through the meta mangler. kilmer (also fabulous) sidles up to deliver sarcasm, machismo and tongue in cheek posturing, the chemistry with downey concrete. an odd couple pairing beautifully baring fruit, and, well, just beautiful really. 

into the mix is the gorgeous monaghan, who as harry's childhood object of affection, is now a failed actress, slightly damaged, but strong and savvy, but also not, an unconditional femme fatale, but also not really! corbin bernsen (whose company produced the pic) files in for some joy filled has-been smarm, while sound tracking and photography sit comfortably with the nature of the beast. as a plot it's deliberately complex and convoluted, black knows his noir onions, but he also wants to put his vibrant stamp on things, so he crowbars the comedy of the hard way into the hardboiled haze of the big sleep. and it works very well indeed. 

violence is aplenty but very much irreverently played. murders occur, either by design or otherwise, various body parts get assaulted and they shouldn't make for belly laughs, but they do; and not in some lame weekend at bernie's way either. and yet still black has time to trickle sad themes below the surface, one in particular really hits home and forces the viewer to snap out of the frivolity for some reflection. make no bones about it, these are damaged characters straight out of noir's dark alleyways in the 40s and 50s. so capra meets siodmak - dmytryk - mann - tourneur - wilder...then?

1055,"jack wyatt (will ferrell), a hollywood star recovering from a couple of box office bombs, is talked into starring in a reboot of the 1964 television series, bewitched. desperate to regain his fame, he insists on hiring an unknown actress to play samantha as not to be overshadowed. when he finds isabel, she seems perfect for the part. little does he know, isabel is a real witch.

i have not seen this movie since watching it in the theaters in 2005, so i didn’t remember much about it. written and directed by nora ephron, there’s a certain amount of expectation when watching it. this is the woman who wrote when harry met sally and you’ve got mail, after all. unfortunately, bewitched doesn’t really live up to those expectations, despite its potential.

nicole kidman seems like the obvious choice to replace elizabeth montgomery as the witchy samantha (isabel). isabel is looking to put her witchy ways behind her, live a normal life and find love. she seems pretty naïve of the real world but she’s instantly smitten with jack and agrees to become the samantha to his darren. kidman is wide-eyed and breathy and will ferrell is… well, will ferrell at the peak of his own comedic career. they work perfectly fine on screen together, but the romantic chemistry is practically non-existent.

bewitched seems to be missing that ephron magic that made her previous romantic comedies so enchanting. it could be the miscasting of will ferrell, or the overly formulaic plot. it never seems to truly commit to the idea that the love story between isabel and jack is the real remake of bewitched and instead of relies on special effects and some minor, silly spell casting/shenanigans to try and make the movie work. michael caine’s talent is completely wasted and steve carrell, whom i usually adore, shows up briefly as the obnoxious uncle arthur… and he really commits to the obnoxious part.

that being said, there were some parts of the movie that i found to be entertaining. shirley maclaine makes the most of her under-developed role as iris/endora and some of the sight gags are amusing. as usual, the ephron soundtrack is full of cozy nostalgia, but it’s just not enough to make bewitched worthy of its material source. i don’t regret watching it (again), but it’s unlikely i’ll return for another repeated viewing.

1057,"white noise fizzles out its noisy static by just being plain boring. watching keaton as he unconvincingly stares at televised white noise for an hour and a half, which is essentially nothing, perfectly surmises the experience of sax' supposedly supernatural horror. however, the biggest crime that the studio committed was releasing the feature on the first weekend of the year. now, it's common knowledge that the initial start to the cinematic year typically begins with a disposable horror. well, white noise is to blame. signalling untapped box office potential, despite the overt opinions of critics. and, as to be expected, matches the quality of a broken tape. a successful architect loses his wife to a drowning accident, to which he then encounters a psychic introducing him to the supernatural phenomenon of evp.

electronic voice phenomena. y'know, recording background noise in a room, playing back the tape and flabbergasted when the ghost of ‪michael jackson‬ hauntingly sings ""thriller"". except in white noise the tool that's used is, well, white noise. the annoyingly hypnotising static from televisions when no channel is picked up from the current frequency. keaton becomes entranced by the ominous voices and high definition faces he sees within the six televisions he owns in his modern apartment. who is making contact? is it his wife? malevolent entities trapped in the cubic prison that is a television? pretty sure writer johnson didn't even know himself.

the film is a mess. it's muddled, confused and abhorrently remains stagnant throughout. this architect, a father, essentially abandons his son when fixated on saving souls warned by his deceased wife that conveniently match the images in the white noise as soon as he arrives to any given scenario, despite ""willow avenue"" being mentioned days before. so think of it as 'final destination' meets 'pulse' (original, obviously...). except it's neither as entertaining as the former nor as horrifying as the latter.

keaton looked bored as hell and overacted in times of emotional distress, although reassured the narrative with control. the jump scares were obnoxiously tame, yet admittedly one of the piercing noises made me twitch my body. the ending is...well, let's just not talk about it. it's terrible, with cgi ghost things swooping in on batman, and answers no lingering questions that the mystery of evp conjured up. heck, the feature begins and concludes with onscreen text about ""existing"" occurrences. ""1 in 12 cases are dangerous"". yeah. ok. you know what is dangerous? ruining keaton's career. we had to wait a decade later for his rejuvenation!

i went into this knowing that johnny knoxville (""jackass"") and seann william scott (""american pie"": stifler) are both really funny, and at least jessica simpson is pretty, but she's not the siren they present her to be, but comedy.  on the boys' side, you get pretty much what you would expect, but nothing surprisingly good.  though there is a scene where they're pretty much thankful to be arrested because they're about to be killed for a ""black face"" joke.  i'll admit the context is pretty nuanced and well handled, but they also...could have just not done it.

i'm stretching for good bits, and the best thing is probably the script.  the actual story of two average idiots trying to save their town from an evil capitalist they do is actually pretty good.  imagine the ""evil oil baron"" bit from ""the muppets"", but they're country boys.

zorro 'never kills anyone' with his sword. he smacks them on the backside, slaps them on the face, or flips them on their butts. this doesn't stop the villains from killing folks; they have a field day while bandaras is more concerned about waving to the cheering crowds than saving his friends.

the hired henchman is within zorro's killing field from the very first scenes right through the movie. however, for some mystical reason not (revealed by the film makers), zorro lets him and his friends escape each time, until jones finally puts him down near the end.

constant bickering between bandaras and jones throughout the flick, and zorro's playful heroic non lethal fighting style, ruin this potentially good film.

1069,"**a clever and dextrous sequel, and a good adventure movie to spend some family time.**

i really liked the first film, one of the best modern swashbuckling films, and i didn't expect anything too inferior from this one, which has the ability to create a good continuity with its predecessor. the action takes place a few years later, during the ephemeral republic of california, which had achieved independence to join the usa. in the film, diego and elena's marriage is falling apart, and they end up separated. she is then coerced into working for the pinkerton's, who seek to keep tabs on a european aristocrat who has just moved to the region, and whom elena already knew from her youth. meanwhile, diego tries to stay active as zorro and reconcile that with his obligations as the father of the young and willful joaquin, a deep admirer of the masked hero who is not yet aware of his father's double life.

despite being undoubtedly a good film, it is slightly weaker than its predecessor because it has a more complicated script and tries to do more things at the same time. diego, elena and joaquin act by themselves against different opponents. that's not a bad thing, just different: the film is full of action and adventure, it's aesthetically beautiful and fun. what i really didn't like is the predictability of the story, roughly from the middle onwards, and that story of the knights of aragon which, besides being a very stupid cliché, is something absolutely far-fetched.

antónio banderas and catherine zeta jones return to their characters, and they are very good at bringing them to life, which is an excellent point in favor of the whole film. the best scenes here, in addition to the fights and action, are the various scenes where both act together, with excellent chemistry and wonderfully developed joint work. the young actor who gave life to the son of both characters, adrian alonso, is not particularly brilliant, but he does what he needs to and is effective. rufus sewell is not unpleasant, he exudes an almost aristocratic presence, and that made his character more believable, but it doesn't make him a really fearsome villain.

technically, it's a pretty standard film with nothing special, and the most common ingredients of hollywood adventure blockbusters: extremely choreographed fights with no chance of happening in a real situation, but cinematic and fun, a light, polite style, a lot of political correctness very common in family films, absence of dead moments thanks to an edition that gave rhythm and some velocity to the story, good sets and costumes that look beautiful, even if they are not exactly rigorous from the historical point of view, and a lively soundtrack, which pulls the atmosphere up and makes the film livelier and more dynamic, harmoniously blending with the cinematography, where warm colors dominate the look.",high

it's yet another sports drama from the studio, one of many still to come too, but it's a cut above their previous live-actions releases in this subgenre; even beating 2002's <em>'the rookie'</em>, which i like tremendously.

i love every detail of <em>'the greatest game ever played'</em>, which is about a true story. the score is splendid, the cinematography is excellent and the premise is riveting - even to someone like me who isn't a follower of golf. there are a few scenes that use effects, namely with vardon, which look neat.

vardon is portrayed by stephen dillane, who is terrific in the role. stephen marcus plays ted ray, he's another top performer as is josh flitter (eddie) - the latter brings some amusing humour to events.

1075,"brick is a detective/noir film but to the viewer’s surprise, in a high-school setting. it is written and independently directed by rian johnson. at the mention of any movie revolving around high school or teenagers, all that comes to mind are the various stereotypes but this movie gives a surprise to the viewer.
the story revolves around a particular, rather abrupt and frantic phone call received by the high school misfit, brendan frye (joseph gordon-levitt) from his terrified ex-girlfriend, emily kostich (emilie de ravin) who begs him for his help. brendan vows to investigate and solve her murder himself and is - in the process - forced to mingle with the very same high school stereotypes that he so diligently avoided. the character of brendan is quite the risk taker, fearless to investigate all possible sources of information with the help of his only friend and a stereotypical nerd ‘the brain’. with his vigilant tactics, he is determined to get his way into the neighborhood’s suspicious drug and crime network connected by some of the high school students and the local gang/drug leader ‘the pin’; in order to get around to solving the mystery.
rian johnson took some time to write the script which took inspiration from multiple sources like the noir film era of the 30s-40s. while taking its plot and feel from the celebrated american author dashiell hammett’s detective novels, the film is also largely inspired by the anime “cowboy bebop”. brendan’s character shows a huge influence of the lead character from the anime. rian has focused greatly on minute details. each character in the film has a connection with the other making the plot more complex and intricate. also, a really vague (or maybe not so vague) thing i observed was the alliteration. the title of the film is “brick”, the characters are “brendan”, “brain” & “brad”. i think this was done deliberately to provoke the thinking of the audience.
a hard to miss fact is that there are only two adults in the movie. one, the pin's mother; she is in the kitchen as her son makes his deals, making breakfast and pouring juice for his friends, while the film's only other adult, the school vice-president who is using brendan as an informant. another amusing writing wonder was the absence of education and parents from the entire high-school/ teenage setup. small humorous elements keep the film going. the scene when brendan reaches the coffee place and messes with the straw (a kid is drinking juice from) there will surely make one laugh. another one is when the pin’s mother searches for milk to serve brendan and her son is there with his muscle power making a crime deal.
now coming to another major aspect that makes the film do wonders is the cast: led by a young joseph gordon-levitt as loner brendan frye. it is a film that he made before he was getting big. he was in that transitional phase between child star and adult actor and this is one of the first movies that displayed the true talent that he really has. his character shows such grit that he takes huge amounts of beatings from “tugger” just to meet “the pin” some of the other characters in the film that steal the show are that of the local drug lord “the pin” played by lucas haas and the geeky/nerdy character of “the brain” played by matt 0’leary. it was so enticing that a big number of fan theories suggest that the character of brain didn’t exist at all and it was just brendan taking the help of his conscience. basically, like sherlock’s ‘mind palace.’
the visual set up, lighting and sound design also perfectly compliment the vibe of the film, with effective variations to fit the intensity of what is going on. for the kind of small budget involved; a short 20-day shooting period; the use of feasible editing; production and vfx equipment, the film definitely does not disappoint on screen. the edit team did a great job on the various transitions involved. the ones that mesmerised me in particular were the ‘time transitions’ and the ‘light to dark transitions’. in a couple shots, the scene transitions into another with the focus on the digital clock in brendan’s bedroom. as a lover of inventive cinematography, the biggest standout for me was the framing, everything is shot from a lower angle, and many characters are defined as much by their shoes as anything else. dp steve yedlin made a point that each character’s establishing shot begins with their shoes (making the audience more curious and confused) and then gradually reaches to a close-up. this creativity is well-thought and well-executed. the impressive background score is composed by director rian johnson’s own cousin nathan johnson. it is mainly made up of xylophone-like sounds but during fight scenes it shifts to percussion sounds and strings sounds during intense/climax scenes. the combination score is a mixture of both traditional and home invented instruments giving a strange balance in the background.
brick is a thoroughly enjoyable film, an experimental debut by the director that was surely a huge risk. it is a perfect homage to the noir classics and at the same time, it is a dark and effective take on a high school student’s life belonging to a small town. the viewer is intrigued by the blunt character of the protagonist and is forced to get into his universe. however, those who are not fascinated by indie/experimental films in general might find it boring or confusing. but it surely won’t disappoint anyone.",high
1078,"**between black comedy and disgusting horror, it's not a movie that wants to be taken seriously.**

rob zombie is a decidedly strong stomach man. his musical curriculum could be enough to prove it, but we still have his horror films, full proof of his taste for blood and shocking scenes. personally, i'm not a fan of excessively bloody films, i think that the blood and deaths in a horror film shouldn't be indiscriminate, it ends up being counterproductive and having a perverse effect, as if we got used to it, making this type of resource less effective.

this film is the sequel to “house of 1000 corpses”: starting where it ends, it shows us the siege of the decrepit firefly house to arrest or massacre that family of degenerates. they manage to escape and will spread panic in the region, while the local police try everything to catch them. to understand this film, therefore, i recommend first seeing the film that gives rise to these events (and which is just as violent and disgusting as this one). however, i felt that this film has a slightly better script than its predecessor and that it tries to at least create a good story, ""bonnie & clyde"" style, with cultural references to ned kelly, ma barker and others.

the slash subgenre, to which this film belongs, has a legion of fans and some renowned films, namely the “saw” franchise. they are films filled with violent deaths, infamous acts, obscenities and graphic content. i already expected this here. what i really don't understand is how zombie tries to introduce comedy into a movie like this. even dealing with black humor, attempts to introduce humor end up cutting the atmosphere.

back to characters they already knew, sid haig and bill moseley continue to do a great job as actors. they dominate the film and their characters are both comic (it didn't work for me but…) and brutal and sadistic. sherry moon zombie, who is the director's wife, gained more prominence in this film, where she appears naked (or almost) in several scenes. the veteran and prestigious leslie easterbrook (who most people will remember for her performance in the comedies of the “police academy” franchise) replaced karen black, but i confess that i felt at various times that the actress did not fit into this type of material. the film also features other well-known actors such as william forsythe, ken foree, danny trejo and taylor maine.

technically, the film has some points that deserve to be highlighted, starting with the use of good special effects and good digital resources, which the director took full advantage of. we cannot fail to observe with some pleasure the richness of detail in the sets and costumes, and the good work of the camera. the soundtrack features several well-known songs, and contributes to not taking the film too seriously.",low

i never understood the hate this movie gets. it's a michael bay movie to the core, which means you know there will be some insane action, incredible visuals, and there may or may not be a great story. but the island does a decent job of making you care about the characters as they grow and discover who they are. the cast is excellent. the chase scene is one of the best you will see. it's a big loud over-the-top action blockbuster, but i guess this is a movie that rises or falls to your expectations. if you expect a michael bay action movie with some sci-fi influence, you will probably enjoy yourself.",high
1092,"visceral, visionary, visual, sin city kicks the big un!

three grizzled stories from basin city comprise the basis for robert rodriguez's adaptation of frank miller's graphic novels (miller along for co-directing duties as well). man mountain marv is out to avenge a murdered hooker, dwight attempts to help the red light girls stay independent from the mob, and aging cop hartigan is trying to protect a beautiful dancer from a sadistic pervert.

i think the first thing i should say is that i have no frame of reference as regards the adaptation here, i have never read (or seen) a frank miller story, but from what i can gather from the imdb site is that fans of miller's graphic stories were well pleased with the final result. i'm pleased to see that, because too many times comic book adaptations are roundly panned by the hard core fan base of each respective franchise for not being close to the spirit of the source, so here i'm doubly relieved mainly because i find sin city to be a majestic assault on the senses.

sin city is a stark place, full of seedy residents thriving on misery and mistrust, and here we are privy to three stories that only serve to remind us that we don't want to be anywhere near the place. playing out as some sort of horror comic noir, sin city is for sure a very violent picture, yet the violence is formed so perfectly in its style, it cloaks the film in artistic class. once viewed, sin city is never forgotten, and i for one literally do tip my hat towards frank miller & robert rodriguez for bringing such a great and interesting movie to the masses. all of the cast do great work, so i'll not single anyone out for praise, the techniques and the whole structure of the piece is quite simply marvellous, and as for the writing? well get a load of it!

1099,"during the trial for his events, a lawyer tries to help her client, a priest, seek the truth about what happened to the young woman who died under his care while performing an exorcism to cure her of a demonic possession and eventually lets the truth about it be known.

this wasn't anywhere as bad as it could've been. the film is really split into two halves here with this one being basically helped greatly by its really good possession and shock scenes. the opening scene that sets her up to becoming possessed is one of it's best sequences, as the long hallway and the unearthly voices floating around give it an unearthly feel while the first scene in the classroom where she sees a demonic face appearing in the window through a cloud of mist and turns around to see a student's face turn into a distorted demon's face giving off an unearthly roar makes it quite shocking. running out into the rain and seeing more demonic faces give off the same unearthly roar is a bit clichéd, but it still helps to sell the mood while the finale in the church giving this a quite creepy conclusion. the different manners of how she’s become afflicted are quite memorable moments with the frenzied bug-eating, speaking in tongues or just contorting her body into such impossible positions that it really becomes obvious something is wrong with her, and the long, suspenseful and chilling exorcism is the film's selling point, coming off with any number of creepy ideas and scenes in such a drawn-out style is one of the best scenes in the film. otherwise, beyond the shocks and the exorcism, there isn't much else to like about it. therefore, everything else in it doesn't really work which is only relegated to the courtroom battle drama. it's marketed as being a supernatural possession film, and the best moments come from those scenes, but the fact that the majority of the film is a courtroom battle with the supernatural elements coming in the form of flashbacks is a real misstep and is likely to confuse those coming in expecting the other kind of film. it's not that they're boring or anything, it's just that it's out of nowhere that it becomes that way, and it can be a disappointment. the fact that these are slow and really long don't help matters, extending this out far longer than it should. this could've easily been an hour and a half, or maybe a little longer, but the two hours running time forces it to keep the courtroom antics going for no reason other than to extend the running time. a few extraneous scenes could've been snipped as well, including the introductory scenes at the bar that repeat information we already know and also keep the running time going, and most of the time simply elicit a feeling of wanting to move along and get to the good scenes. these really harm the film.

1112,"when i watched this version of the austen classic prior to packing the dvd away for a move, i assumed ahead of time it would stay nestled behind the colin firth version as my second favorite adaptation of pride and prejudice. now, however, pending my watching the other version again, this might indeed be my new favorite. not due to any major differences in acting ability or in the writing, but rather for the way it nails down the little things, the stuff i may not have noticed the first time or two i watched it.

one simple example is of the portrayal of mary, one of the servants in the bennet household. she says hardly anything during the course of the movie, but a couple of times we follow her while she is singing as she works, and i found it utterly charming. and i think it illustrates, whether or not it was intended, that this is a pleasant house that servants did not dread to start their work days in. 

there is also at one of the balls a long scene of dancing that shows several of the characters who are involved in subplots going on, all within this continuous shot. it is clever, and on one website it is said the camera was left running by accident; a happy accident if you ask me. also, a few of the scenic moments, such as one time when elizabeth merely stares lost in thought in the middle of great beauty, are amiable natural breaks in the action.

the acting is very good, of course, with this cast, but also their attitude is perfect. brenda blethyn excels in the thankless role of the silly mother, managing not to cross the line into looking outright ridiculous. sutherland is — well, i will give any movie a try with him in it. keira knightly is, for me, astonishingly good. if you had described to me before i watched it the way, when she or her family is insulted, she looks jolted for a moment, but then with a short laugh or smile shakes it off, i would have said “nope, that won’t work.” but it works. her wit is sensational. i write fiction myself and always try to to feature witty female characters, and elizabeth would fit right into my modern novels.

dame penelope wilton is excellent as always, and claudia blakey shone as charlotte. if pressed to find at least one small fault, i could only say that i think the writers and director (and possibly jane austen herself) may have underestimated mary bennet as a character. i have always thought that more could be done with her, in every version.

1123,"well, no matter how i rate this movie a lot of people are going to say that my rating is wrong. that is something that you probably can say about any rating for any movie. i feel it is especially true as far as this movie goes though. as you can see from my rating i was not exactly thrilled by the movie. that does not mean that it is a bad movie. again, this you can say about a lot of ratings, especially my ratings.

okay, i guess i have confused everyone enough now so let me try to explain. as a piece of cinematic art this movie is excellent. the acting is quite good. i especially liked john hurt as the literate bounty hunter but most of the main characters where performing admirably. the scenery is wonderful. the australian outback makes for a excellent backdrop and it is indeed a nice change from the classical north american western sceneries.

as a movie it falls flat though. in my opinion a movie should at least try to tell a story. even if it aspires to be a piece of art it should try and tell a story that the audience can, in one way or another, follow. this movie have a basic idea of a story but it does not really tell a story. we never get to know who the bad guys really are, what they really did, except for a bunch of hints about killing and rape, or why. heck, we never actually get to know of the guy the flogged to death where really taking part in the deed or not.

throughout the movie the bad guys are supposedly hiding in some place where it is impossible to get them so the main character tries to get the bad guys brother to kill him. not very plausible at all. the governor, eden fletcher played by david wenham, or whatever he as supposed to be was pretty much an asshole. okay every movie has to have one but his role was never really developed. once he managed to get the young kid, innocent or not, flogged we really do not see much of him for the rest of the movie.

the end of the movie is much the same as the rest of the movie. cinematically excellent but not much of a story. there is no real conclusion. it just ends in a sequence of well done scenes but without any real story behind it.

1129,"get rich or die tryin' reminds me of the apocryphal chinese curse 'may you live in interesting times'. the most interesting thing that has happened to curtis '50 cent' jackson is that he has been shot nine times; accordingly, not only the character he plays, marcus 'young caesar' greer, but also a lot of other people get shot in this movie.

most of them survive, though, so even this turns out to be not so special after all. as for the second most interesting experience in fifty’s life, this actually happened to someone else: 8 mile, the vastly superior film starring eminem and released three years prior.

the problem is that 8 mile is a story about humility, while grodt is about arrogance; the title alone exudes hubris, and the fact that it shares its title with a 50 cent album makes us think that the inflated ego is not limited to the character, but it affects the star as well. 

unlike em, who didn't play himself but played someone very much like him in particular and a real human being in general, marcus greer is not so much a fictionalized version of jackson as 50 cent's idea of ​​50 cent. 

young caesar is the larger-than-life figure that curtis jackson desperately wants to be, to the point that a modest 50 cents is not enough anymore; only a nickname that references arguably the most brilliant political and military mind history will suffice.

this is unintentionally ironic because the protagonist is not the sharpest knife in the kitchen; for example, little marcus's (marc john jefferies) mother is murdered, and the suspect is a ""rick james-looking motherfucker"" (leon, criminally underutilized), so marcus keeps a photo of the super freak ever near him, because otherwise he would forget what her mother's alleged killer looks like? 

this is supposed to be a drama, a genre that the filmmaker, having directed my left foot and in the name of the father, should know very well; on the other hand, the director also wrote those films, so the blame for this inexplicable faux pas falls squarely on the scriptwriter.

the hero's dickensian childhood was a cliché that 8 mile could afford to skip because the dysfunctional interaction between em and kim basinger told us everything we needed to know about it without the need for flashbacks narrated in fifty’s uninflected monotone.

then again, the soundtrack includes a song called “window shopper,” which means a mandatory shot of little marcus staring forlornly through a window at the sneakers he can't afford, while a couple of extras taunt him.

the director surrounds jackson with strong supporting cast (adewale akinnuoye-agbaje, terrence howard, the monolithic bill duke), but this is a double-edged sword; either they elevate fifty to their level, or they completely overshadow him until he disappears, which is exactly what happens here.

now, if jackson were any smarter or less selfish, he would have let howard, still fresh from a similar role in hustle & flow, play the lead, instead of saddling him with the role of his trusty sidekick bama. 

nevertheless, howard steals every scene he’s in (and has the best lines of dialogue; e.g., ""bama. are you from alabama?"" ""no, north carolina."" ""why do they call you bama?” “i didn't want people to call me lina”), including the best of them all: a revealing scuffle in a jail shower that preceded the turkish bath fight in eastern promises by two years.

the big difference is that hustle &flow is about a pimp who aspires to become a musician, while grodt is about a gangbanger who gets distracted too easily: “i had my own space and i could focus on my dream of being a rapper… after three hours, i quit my career as a rapper and went back to selling coke.” in other words, why make an effort when one is such a prodigy that, when imprisoned, the other inmates and even the guards know the lyrics to young caesar’s future chart-topping hits?",low

1133,"**i have nothing against remakes… but at least try to do them well!**

i've seen john carpenter's film _the fog_ a few years ago, but i remember it well and how pleasant it was to see it. the original film didn't shed a drop of fake blood, it wasn't the kind of extremely visual film we've grown used to in recent years, with blood spurting everywhere and chunks of flesh flying towards us. carpenter made a clean film, without the jumps that made us fall out of our chairs, but tense, very tense and full of mystery. and ultimately, that's really what made the film work so well… and that's what this film lacks, precisely!

the remake maintains, in essence, the script of its predecessor: antonio bay is an american coastal city that is about to celebrate the centenary of its foundation when mysterious occurrences and macabre deaths begin to happen, always related to a strange-looking fog, quite dense and somewhat greenish. however, the discovery of an old diary, written by one of the city's founders, finally brings some clarifications: after all, the entire city was founded at the cost of dozens of innocently killed human lives, and now, a hundred years later, his souls are returning from the sea, desirous of revenge.

i confess that i expected more from this film. the truth is, if i didn't really know what happens in this movie (thanks to carpenter's movie) i don't know if i would understand what's going on here. terribly poorly written, the script fails to convey the whole story to us, and new audiences run the risk of not understanding everything. it's a messy story, with flaws and missing parts. on the other hand, the film lacks any kind of tension, suspense or functional mystery. it has some good things, it tries to involve more characters, to take the focus away from that isolated broadcaster at the lighthouse, but the truth is that i don't know if this was really a good idea, since the film was much less clear and understandable than its predecessor and none of the characters manages to engage us, or capture our sympathy and interest.

directed by rupert wainwright, it was the last feature film of his career, and although john carpenter lent his name to the film, he has publicly stated that he was not involved in the project. the cast has several names and actors, but none particularly sounding name, and none of the actors was able to shine or really give us a work worthy of being fully appreciated, in a positive way.

on a technical level, the film has a fairly regular cinematography and makes good use of all the filming locations used. the visual effects and cgi work quite well, and the fog is truly impressive and even beautiful. but the film's redeeming qualities end here. i would like, as a historian, to highlight in particular my repudiation and disgust for the way they recreated the boat scenes, where we see blake and his traveling companions. as the event takes place at the end of the 19th century, it is inconceivable and unacceptable that the production decided to use clothing, props and even a ship style from the late 18th century, that is, from a period one hundred years prior to the one intended to be retracted. this is mocking with history, and a sign of utter negligence on the part of the producers and the technical team.",low
1135,"with the litany of comic book films being made in 2017, it's hard to understand the role v for vendetta has played in 'comic book movie' culture. this was one of the early successes of the genre and it continues to shine today in ways other movies (i'm looking at you, marvel) have not. 

the grittiness of the story cannot be understated, this story is dark. however, the message of the story is one of hope, and hope is a difficult thing to capture. this film captures both, with the help of excellent cinematography and slow-motion action cuts.

 i get the sense when i watch this film that something bigger is happening around me, and honestly in 2017, this movie feels more relevant than ever. themes of state-run media empires, government corruption of the highest order, and the suffocation of all that is 'other' permeates the fabric of this film, and everything is captured beautifully in a noir-esque nightmarescape of future, facist london.

i can honestly say that more than a decade later, this film still shines as one of the great comic book movies and its themes will continue to ring true as long as we have people in the world who exist to limit others. let's just hope that someday this world does not feel any more real than it does now.",high

not only is the phoenix storyline butchered, but the script rewrites the personalities of its key characters. since when were cyclops, xavier, and magneto such assholes? halle berry's demand for more screentime basically means she shows up in more scenes. her character has no arc and often says lines that contradict what she said in previous scenes. rogue has also turned into a whiny sidenote, part of a shoehorned in love triangle, which is disappointing given that the trilogy started from her perspective.

throwing in as many mutants as you can on the screen, some with powers that would be good if this were an x-men spoof, but here it's played for absolute seriousness. it also means every character is essentially one note because there's no time to develop anyone. it certainly doesn't help that the movie carelessly removes or kills off half the team from the previous two films. instead of shocking me, i'm sitting there never sure who i should be rooting for (except for wolverine).

x3 hurtles through scene after scene to get from one action set piece to another, and at just 93 minutes, there's never any time to process the plot. of course the movie has to sequel bait with a final scene that suggests everyone will eventually get their powers back. what a way to render the entire movie pointless.

lastly, this movie cost $215 million to make. only about a quarter of that money shows up on the screen. the cgi, green screen, and makeup effects are obvious and look horrible. so the movie looks like crap, tells it's story like crap, and treats it's characters like crap. x3 is crap.",low

1159,"arrogance and self-awareness seldom go hand in hand.

casino royale is directed by martin campbell and adapted by neil purvis, robert wade & paul haggis from a story written by ian fleming. it stars daniel craig, eva green, mads mikkelsen, judi dench, jeffrey wright & giancarlo giannini. it's the 21st film in the james bond franchise.

plot finds craig as bond, newly promoted to 00 status, he is thrust into the murky world of high financed terrorism.

one of the hardest series of films to get right, with some of the most committed of fans, is that of the james bond series. to wit, there will never ever be a bond film that will appease every fan across the board. the complaints will range from not enough gadgets, too far removed from fleming's essence, not serious enough and vice a versa: too darn serious. then there is the usual round of arguments concerning the leading man stepping into the tuxedo, for every bond fan ready to fight to the death in the name of sean connery, i'll find you another prepared to back timothy dalton's take on the martini swigging legend. once it became clear that pierce brosnan had run his course as bond, bowing out with the super silly die another day in 2002, the pressure for any new bond, both the actor and the makers, was immense. 2006 and time had moved on, and we live in different cinema times, spy movies are a different breed to what went before, the bourne identity had raised the bar. the news filtered thru that bond was to be rebooted and that daniel craig was the man to be bond. the howls of derision could be heard from as far as the tropical locations so in keeping with a james bond plot. too blonde, too craggy faced, not tall enough, and why reboot a much loved franchise anyway? it was war and the heat was turned up to full.

casino royale still has its critics, but as majorities go as regards a bond film, this one has the biggest sway. sure, the daniel craig haters will not be bowed, they can't after all lose face after such a vitriolic campaign against his casting, but few, i suspect, can seriously deny casino royale is not a magnificent bond movie. just a peak at the worldwide box office figures shows you how well received it was, making nearly $600 million, those are figures that do not lie. the truth is that casino royale has almost everything you could wish for from a bond movie, and a little more. gorgeous locations, beautiful women and reams of action; where, the stunt department reach new heights. it's also refreshingly in keeping with fleming's original story, only major difference here is that the makers have upgraded it to a post 9/11 world. there's nods to traditional franchise staples, whilst also neatly streamlining some of the previous film's comedy scene fillers. smart villain too, mads mikkelsen's le chiffre, complete with creepy eye issue and loyal girlfriend, is a villain not trying to blow up the world because he's mad, but trying to outwit bond to stay alive! that's great stuff that keeps a bond thriller alive and well.

but for all the energy and pyrotechnics (there's enough in this one film to have filled half a dozen of previous bond entries), a bond film can only succeed if the leading man is up to scratch. thankfully, and joyously, craig nails it, both in physicality, swagger and raw egotistical aggression. more telling is that craig's bond is more human that what we are used too, at one time suave and appearing unruffled, the next, bruised battered and emotionally conflicted. this is a new and rounded bond, given impetus by craig's powerful presence. he is helped by eva green putting brains and slinkiness into vesper lynd, a bond girl to turn bond's head in a way not seen since diana rigg's tracy di vicenzo in ohmss. though one of the film's rare missteps is to under write the part. felix leiter also gets a quality tune up in the form of jeffrey wright, judi dench's m kicks arse and giancarlo giannini adds a touch of continental class as bond's montenegro contact rené mathis. layered over the top is a nifty score by david arnold, blending traditional bond flavours with high energy bursts and phil meheux's photography brings optical delights in the bahamas, czech republic and italy.

opening with the best chase sequence in the whole franchise and closing with an ultimate bond moment, this is reboot supreme. it's high energy with intelligent humanistic smarts and bond is back: blonder, brutal and most assuredly better. 9/10",high

this is hardly a 007 movie, and can't be called a ""film"". it's just the same hollywood formula of contriving a story to be as depressing as possible.
the same formula hollywood had prided itself on since about 1965.
it's very dull, and there's no imagery.
007 films once had exotic scenery that was done in a cinematic way.
no more. 
this has absolutely nothing to do with daniel craig. it doesn't matter who plays 007 when the writer and director are control freaks for hatefulness.
if you can stay awake through the dull scenery and ridiculous lines (bond even says it doesn't matter what cards you have in a poker game. this movie goes beyond ""retarded""), then you wonder what the plot is. bond goes through a kidnapping ordeal and losing in cards, and he's obviously a victim of card cheating, but this genius doesn't suspect that.

i've watch this movie so many times, and it's probably one of my favorite movies.  with the ridiculous premise that you have to go to college, what happens to the qualified people that don't get in: they make their own way, literally.

just the concept of doing something like this is fascinating, and with the cast, the delivery is amazing: justin long, blake lively, maria thayer, (fat) jonah hill, lewis black, and even a young hannah marx.

the jokes are paced so well, and there is some noticeable punch up, but it's usually so good i don't mind.   part of the reason i like this writing is that a lot of it is character based: just making weird and fun characters and making them live in this fun world.  so many of the scenes have background action happening, which is risky, but the pay off is magnificent.

what you have is a film vaguely about the black dahlia, vaguely about a couple of buddy cops with a secrete, vaguely about a love triangle, and vaguely about the period....and that is why it didn't sit well with so many people. it was vaguely about a lot of things and never exactly about any of them.

however, there is enough mystery to it to hold my attention, enough style to make it cool and fun, and good enough acting to make it believable.

unfortunately, in this 3rd installment it seems that the producer took some shortcuts and produced the all to common teenage splatter movie. that is, do not bother about spending time on a decent script nor any acting capabilities to talk about. replace all that with some wiggling boobs and behinds to appeal to the not too intelligent part of the teenage movie going audience, kill of a few of the bearers of said boobs and behinds at regular intervals in an increasingly goory and spectacular way and you’re done.

having enjoyed <i>sin city</i>, a film with a similar green screen approach, i thought that <i>300</i> would be enjoyable on the basis of its special effects, but alas it wasn't. for one, the cinematography is claustrophobic. all outdoor scenes but one were filmed with a green screen, and the digital backdrops add no depth. even when supposedly standing on the greek coast under a big sky, everyone seems like they are just standing around in a fairly small room. also, the fight scenes seem more primitive than considering that this film followed years after <i>the matrix reloaded</i>.

the little i can recommend <i>300</i> for is the variety of demonic monsters and exotic costumed assassins that fill the persian army. as i said, this is a fantasy on historical themes, and the additions are often interesting. still, i had a hard time sitting through the whole film.",low

1221,"_**slasher parody with good plot & technical work, but too raunchy and not funny enough**_

tired of partying on bourbon street, a guy and his buddy (joel david moore and deon richmond) decide to take a night sightsee with other tourists at the alligator-infested bog, unaware of the dubious nature of the tour and the legend of a notorious hatchet man lurking the woods.

""hatchet"" (2006) is a horror/comedy/spoof that combines the indoor swamp sets of “man-thing” (2005) with elements of the “wrong turn” or “friday the 13th” franchises and the parody tone of “club dread” (2004). regrettably, it’s the least of these. there’s nothing wrong with the cast or technical filmmaking as the gore, f/x and swamp sets are fine, although the ‘monster’ make-up looks kinda cartoonish (which fits the genre).

while it’s relatively amusing and occasionally funny, it’s hindered by an odious raunchy air right out of the gate. for instance, the two supposedly hot girls flash their breasts every 5 minutes in the first half hour. don’t take that as prudish, i’m just pointing out that a movie is questionable when it goes overboard with female nudity to hide its deficiencies. meanwhile the heroine played by amara zaragoza is interesting, but she has little sex appeal, although that’s a matter of taste.

i could handle those flaws if the story was more compelling and the humor more amusing, yet that’s not the case. although the plot is great, the script needed a rewrite to flesh out better prospects. but that takes time & money and the flick only cost 1.5 million, which is almost six times less than what “club dread” cost.

i should add that kane hodder plays the jason-like antagonist while robert englund has a cameo in the opening.     

the film runs 1 hour, 24 minutes, with a longer version running an additional 9 minutes. it was shot in new orleans (mardi gras sequences) with the swamp scenes done in a convincing indoor set at sable ranch, santa clarita, california.

1226,"the grudge 2 resents its illogical plot for basic ineffective jump scares. shimizu’s western remake of his j-horror creation was one littered with promise, albeit irrefutably rough around the edges. mediocre acting, snooze-inducing storytelling and jump scares aplenty. japanese ghost children, that either croak as if exhuming a sore throat or scream like a domestic cat, popping their heads out of attics, entangling women in wavering hair and just being a general nuisance. well, shimizu begrudgingly brings kayako and toshio back for more ghoulish antics, as the fire initiated by sarah “buffy or daphne, your pick...” michelle gellar somehow unleashed the dark spirits into the world. essentially no longer restricted to the abandoned saeki household, although still only haunt those that enter the house? i don’t know, the logic is tossed out of the shōji at this point.

instead of remaking the original sequel for ‘ju-on’, shimizu and writer susco opted for a more original take, answering the fundamental question that we all yearned to ask: “gurl, where did you get that eye liner?”. turns out, dark spirits is the answer. what i supremely detest about this sequel is the direction the two aforementioned crew members decide to take the story. it’s no longer about greeting death with a deep and powerful rage, cursing the location the spirits resides in. a semi-folklorish strand of japanese traditions.

instead, to appease the simple minds of western mainstream audiences, they settled for a mundane supernatural progression that essentially tarnishes the original’s plot in almost every possible angle available. sure, shimizu integrates some well-intentioned imagery that may or may not produce a chill or two. namely the photograph sequence and bludgeoning someone with a frying pan during breakfast (what a waste of bacon!). yet these are often accompanied by a predictable jump scare that relinquishes the horror. kayako pouncing out of a photograph. kayako wandering the hospital corridors bursting lightbulbs in her wake (not very cost-effective...). kayako playing footsies in a love hotel room. kayako being kayako. once or twice was enough. twenty times? rapidly becoming unimaginative.

the non-linear intersecting sub-plots, imitating its predecessor, provided no twists to the narrative and, if anything, forced the pacing to be inconsistent with its constant switching between character perspectives. a classic peer pressure scenario which is enough to make anyone’s eyes roll a hundred times.

1261,"according to wikiquote, a “british official” once said that idi amin needed “things explained in words of one letter.” it is one of the last king of scotland’s few flaws that it assumes we need things seen through the eyes of a white westerner.

sure, james mcavoy has some very good scenes with forest whitaker, the best of which is arguably the first (though in retrospect it doesn’t quite hold up to scrutiny), which ends with amin and dr. nicholas garrigan exchanging shirts (so that amin can give garrigan’s to his non-existent son campbell, brother to the epileptic, and most likely also imaginary, mackenzie) as if they’d just been in opposing sides of a soccer match.

other scenes are much less fortunate, especially the one wherein the good doctor assists the dictator in the forced release of a massive flatulence. good or bad, though, it matters little because none of this happened, and dr. garrigan never existed – not that he’s the least bit believable, either; starting with how he decides to go to uganda (literally spinning a globe, closing his eyes, and pointing), nicholas invariably behaves more like a character in a movie than an actual human being.

he can grab amin’s sidearm without being instantly gunned down by the sundry nearby soldiers; he can drive, through streets he presumably is unfamiliar with, amin to safety after the latter has been ambushed; he’s fresh off medical school but has the poise of an expert physician; and he’s so irresistible that one of amin’s wives is willing to risk life and limb (or rather limbs, as it turns out) to have sexual congress with him (and even if the character were real, we still wouldn't be interested in his sex life).

wikipedia tells me “the film mixes fiction with real events to give an impression of amin and uganda under his rule.” well, we certainly get an indelible impression of amin thanks to whitaker’s haunting performance; on the other hand, wouldn’t we get a clearer impression of uganda under his rule if the film stuck to the facts?

what’s the point of shooting on location if we only get a perfunctory idea of the effect the dictatorship had on the country and its people? even the captions before the closing credits are too little too late, especially considering they aren’t much more accurate than anything that has gone on before. instead, everything is filtered through garrigan, who cares mostly about saving his own skin and isn’t really all that concerned with the fate of the ugandan nation.

it’s a shame because director kevin macdonald’s influences are impeccable; amin’s “nothing comes from nothing” echoes lear’s “nothing can come of nothing,” and the way he dismisses garrigan at one point is reminiscent of rolf hoppe chewing out klaus maria brandauer in mephisto. perhaps macdonald should have leaned completely towards the fictional approach and made a film à clef (zangaro, the dogs of war’s faux african dictatorship, would have been a good template).",low
1273,"**lust, loneliness and bitterness in an engaging film with two great actresses.**

i was very impressed with this film, which combines two huge and very talented actresses and a script full of tension and very well developed. it's not something new or original, and there are a lot of relatively tense films that are set in a school environment. i can quote one that i saw recently, and that i remembered while watching this film: “the children’s hour”. alright, the movie is about a hypothetical lesbian relationship between teachers, it's a different kind of scandal than what we have in this movie, but somehow it came to my mind. it is not an award-winning film, but it was nominated for two bafta, three globes and four oscars. moreover, it was a competitive year, with several great films competing.

the script is very loosely based on a real case in which a female teacher had a sexual affair with a minor student. the situation is scabrous and criminal, despite the fact that it is also a type of frequent sexual fantasy to be found. however, the film is not about that, but about the tortuous relationship between the young teacher and an older colleague, who discovers the secret. lonely, bitter, critical, psychologically unstable, with serious problems relating to other people and, eventually, a strongly repressed lesbian, the elderly woman creates an abusive relationship where she subjugates and blackmails her supposed friend, mercilessly manipulating her to obtain almost exclusivity of your attention.

in addition to a really good story, the film has an excellent cast and two great actresses who do a superb job. judi dench deserves a standing ovation for the work she leaves in this film: in addition to the sarcastic, almost cruel way in which she narrates the story, the actress was huge and impressive in the way she brought the character to life and played opposite cate blanchett. this one, in turn, was also very good, and does an equally good job, but it does not manage to have the magnetism of dench. the two characters are also very different: blanchett has on her hands a softer, more one-dimensional, less complex character than dench, who is given more challenging, more complicated material, and a character who is really challenging to play convincingly. despite being young, and having a minor role in the film, i also enjoyed andrew simpson's contribution.

technically, it is a discreet film, with excellent cinematography, with dark notes of great skill, which help to thicken the tense environment in which the film develops. with good sets and costumes, but within the predictable, and a relatively good soundtrack that was composed by phillip glass (not as good as the one he made in other films, however), the film is discreet, but competent, and gives us excellent production values.",high

chow is the only actor in this that i'm familiar with, but this clearly tops what i've seen (not enough, granted) of him thus far - still a fan of him as sao feng in <em>'pirates of the caribbean: at world's end'</em>, though. the rest of those onscreen, despite the commanding presence of the aforementioned, still manage to standout in my memory as well, from earlier noted chen and chou to li man to liu ye.

the costumes, the sets... i personally do not think this film really put a foot wrong in terms of how it's made. how about those battle sequences too? visually stunning, but also audibly so. the ending didn't go the way i was expecting, which is very much a positive thing.

unfortunately it is a story told sans talia shire, who along with burt young and carl weathers are rocky staples... of course creed was dead in the timeline, so his absence is excusable... but we all kind of wanted to see adrian, and wanted another story that developed her especially since they kind of stopped developing her as of rocky iii and relegated her to the sidelines.

but, you got to see a typical rocky story. you got to see rocky dig in and be inspiring again... and that is why we all love rocky stories isn't it? rovky v lacked the inspiration, rocky balboa came back with full force and it has continued though creed, and, hopefully, when i get around to watching it, it will be there in creed ii as well.

the magic is that it comes back to the rocky i and ii dynamic, where it's not just about boxing, it's about rocky and his story. and that is what we all missed in iii and iv, and was attempted but failed miserably in v.

one of the best part, i think, is how the characters of two young magicians are depicted -- through small but noticeable details like the facial expressions, one or two words, the novels et cetera.

two brothers with differing financial problems plan to rob their parents' jewellery store. but when all does not go to plan and tragedy strikes, it sends them, and those close to them, into a world of fear, shame and violence...

it opens with a raunchy sex scene, man and wife in the throes of committed passion, for these brief moments there is pleasure. once over, though, it proves to be a false dawn, the last time anyone on screen will taste pleasure in lumet's biting morality tale. from here on in the film unfolds in a dizzying array of multi-perspectives and over lapping of narrative structure, a three pronged assault on the senses as a family implodes in a haze of greed, lies and inadequacies. a botched robbery underpins the plotting, the aftermath of which is what is most cutting, we zip around learning the wherewithal and whys of the key players, learning exactly what we need to know to fully immerse in this bleak world. this is a world populated by love cheats, drug abuse, embezzling, bad parenting and blackmail, a world where the brothers hanson (hoffman & hawke) now dwell, either ill equipped (hawke's hank) or stuck between idiocy and smug evil (hoffman's andy). their folly, their greed, impacting with a juddering severity on the family circle.

my life, it doesn't add up. nothing connects to anything else. i'm not the sum of my parts. all my parts don't add up to one...me.

it would be lumet's last film (he passed away in 2011), thankfully it is a fitting final offering from the talented philadelphian. he's aided considerably, mind, by a razor sharp script from debut screenplay writer masterton. it's full of nastiness and tension, but still observational as a family tragedy, with major bonus' being that it never resorts to stereotypes or cops out come the crushing denouement. where lumet excels is in drawing near faultless performances from his cast. youthful and downtrodden haplessness portrayed by hawke, hoffman's powerhouse manipulator with emotional issues, tomei proving that over 40 is still sexy while dialling into a very touching performance. finney, a cracker-jack of grief from the wily old fox, ryan's hard edged ex-wife and michael shannon strolling into the picture late in the day exuding notable menace. all splendidly guided by the great director who asks them to portray characters convincing in going deeper for motivations and means.

1321,"i don't have a problem with remakes per se. even though i am not a big fan of the original ""halloween"" film directed by john carpenter, i do acknowledge it as a film that started a horror slasher trend and served as an inspiration for many of the films that came after it. since i am not crazy about the 1978 film, i thought i would be able to enjoy this remake without being too influenced by my love for the original film. after seeing this remake, i started to appreciate the original version a little bit more, since rob zombie turned the story and its characters into a vulgar mess.

the original film mostly focuses on the life of laurie strode going on about her business and interacting with her friends for the most part, while we see the mysterious michael myers stalking her, appearing from out of nowhere, and we never really get to know why (without taking the sequels into account). in this remake, rob zombie attempts to explore little michael myers' psychology, giving our villain a soul and establishing the roots of his evilness, taking away all the mystery and darkness surrounding the character. the results are not good by any means and the only thing it proves, is that sometimes, mystery is scarier and more disturbing than having everything explained, especially if the explanation is as predictable as ""he was raised in a bad environment"". the audience doesn't want to be spoon fed and i think it's clear that one of the main reasons why the original villain was scary, it's because michael myers remained as an enigmatic character from the beginning until the end. in the original film, myers appears to come from a seemingly normal family, but for some reason, he turns out a merciless killer anyway. while the original ""halloween"" film is not my favorite, as i established before, i do give the film credit for giving us a villain that no one could ever sympathize with. this film basically tries to portrait michael as a poor little thing who was poorly raised and eliminates any possibility of seeing him as a genuinely dark and fear-provoking character. this overexposure of michael's early years lasts about 40 minutes, which gets tedious, it makes the villain more pitiful than frightening and in the end, they don't really manage to establish a point about his insanity all that well either.

once again, rob zombie casts his wife, sheri moon zombie, who was great in 'house of 1000', playing a insane, trashy girl… but why did she have to play almost the exact same character here? i don't know what's the deal with rob zombie having the need to show us his wife stripping and being sexy all the time, maybe it's some kind of fetish they have and it's all good... but 'halloween' was not the right choice to show sherri moon dancing and showing her body again. another thing that rob zombie seems to borrow from his film ""house of 1000 corpses"" is the fact that the characters are swearing most of the times and while i have nothing against foul language whatsoever, but i think it sounds repetitive and silly when we hear the f-word every 5 seconds. the amount of stupid lines that could be easily compared to some of the crappiest pg-rated films that came out throughout the last years.

i'm really disappointed. i didn't think i was going to hate it so much, but i do and it's a shame because i really wanted to like this film. better luck next time, i guess. my noble advice for all fans of the original 'halloween' movie is: don't watch this remake if you're sensitive, because this hurts a lot. i know i felt cheated, even if i'm not a fan of carpenter's version either.",low
1324,"well it has malcolm mcdowell, and he delivers in the master of accents kind of way.

""halloween mcmlxxviii: this time it's easter,""  you know, that sort of thing.

but we will add one for malcolm mcdowell just because, yeah, he delivers.

so three stars: *** and that is because he might--with a really big stretch on that--have been trying to do a satire thing of the slasher genre with all the naked murdered women.

it was already made and when it came around in 1978 it was moody and atmospheric and, well, it really looked a lot like halloween, only a nightmare version of it.

zombie's remake feels more like a cheap version of halloween and really, the outdoor shots that are supposed to give you the seasonal feel remind me more of thanksgiving pick-up football games. they look and feel less like a nightmare version of halloween than season of the witch's small southern town atmosphere.

and the horror parts, really, any slasher movie and, by the way, since when was halloween about t&a? i thought friday the 13th owned that stereotype and we went to halloween for, you know, atmosphere and scares...at least in the first 2 films.

1329,"the price of redemption -- read this if you had problems with the ending

this remake involves the capture of a notorious outlaw, ben wade (russell crowe), who is then escorted to the town of contention to await the train to yuma, where he'll be hanged. a desperate rancher, dan evans (christian bale), hires on for the escort job because he needs the $200 for his family to survive. wade plays psychological games the entire time trying to corrupt evans, but things turn out differently.

the cast is outstanding (which also features the beautiful gretchen mol and peter fonda), the new mexican locations are great and the score ranks with the all-time best. most importantly the picture is engaging throughout its 2 hour runtime, not to mention the story gives the viewer a lot to chew on.

the first hour of the film is realistic but what turned me off during my initial viewing was the second hour's mounting implausibilities. thankfully, most of these can be explained.

one issue is when a man burns to death locked in a wagon carriage. the quibble is that he doesn't scream enough in fiery torment. but watch the scene and you'll clearly hear him yelling in the background. evan's loss of a limp at the climax is more of an issue, although this can be explained by an adrenaline rush.

one problem i had was that ben wade (crowe) came off as super-human. there was seemingly nothing he couldn't do, even while handcuffed. i suppose this could be explained by the fact that there are people who are incredibly gifted to the point of being nigh super-human. 

in any event, this is not a realistic western like, say, ""wyatt earp"" or ""the long riders."" no, ""3:10 to yuma"" is a mythic western with an potent message. if you can't handle strong mythic elements in westerns look elsewhere.

when i first saw the film i didn't get the ending and it turned me off. but it was clear that there was more to the picture than what first meets the eye so i decided to view it again. it does make sense, it's just that you might miss it on your initial viewing because the events flash by so quickly. when you do see it, it'll blow you away.

***spoiler alert*** do not read further unless you want an explanation of the film! 

wade is a confident and talented man who smugly looks down on others, acting like a disciple of nietzsche who has no moral obligation to anyone, least of all god. he senses simple purity in evans and plays the role of tempter, trying to corrupt evans and win him to his way of thinking. but as they wait in the hotel room it is evans who ""converts"" wade, in a sense. evans doesn't accomplish this in any type of contrived manner, he accomplishes it simply by being who he is -- an undefiled, courageous family man who stubbornly refuses to give up on hope, faith, life, righteousness and family.

as they're waiting, wade sketches a picture of evans in a book. it is later shown that this sketch was made on an opening page of a bible. this reveals that wade came to view evans as a christ figure, at least subconsciously, and that evans is clearly a type of christ in the story.

what exactly was it that caused wade to ""convert"" and support evans? (1.) he saw in evans a man that refused to be bought -- a man who refused to be corrupted by filthy lucre, which was something he never experienced before. (2.) evan's son insisted that there was still some good in wade despite his wicked history. regardless of wade's denial, the kid was right. the idea that someone saw a glimmer of good in him, that someone out there believed in him despite his past evil deeds ultimately moved him and compelled him to support evans. (3.) wade turned evil because he was abandoned as a kid. he saw in evans and his wife a real family -- parents who stayed together and refused to abandon faith, hope, righteousness and family come hell or high water. he became convinced that evans and his family were worth supporting, even perhaps dying for. (4.) evans made a deal with the pinkerton that if he successfully got wade to the train the pinkerton would make sure evans' family got $1000, which would bail them out of their hardships. wade wanted to make sure the family got that money. somewhere deep inside he wanted to redeem himself of his wicked past and this was the opportunity. this could be the beginning of a new life.

(5.) wade's relationship with evans lasted only a few days but he found something that was missing in all his other relationships - a friendship based on respect rather than familiarity or shared events. great friendships like this can happen quickly similar to love-at-first-sight. such relationships are conducive to transparency, which explains why evans reveals to wade the real reason he lost his leg in the war.

after evan's brutal death wade has an even greater revelation: to see a truly undefiled man -- a simple but great man -- murdered by a group of immoral swine fills him with disgust. you can see it on his face. yes, he should be thankful that his men remained loyal to him but this was about their only redeeming quality. to truly start a new life he would have to be judge and executioner of the corrupted souls who would pull him back down into the slime.

why did evans have to die? because redemption can only be paid via the spilling of blood. it was the price for wade to live and have a new life.

1330,"this is the best western of the 21st century so far (for mine, just edging out django unchained). 

building on the classic movie from 1957, james mangold's remake adds in much needed scenes to fill plot holes and build nuanced characters that were sorely lacking in the original.  

our hero now, is a man struggling to keep his farm and the respect of his family whilst the ""antagonist"" (i stretch the use of the word here) is almost tired of his way of life and his ""family.""  adding in the concept of children to these two was smart thinking on the part of the writers and this really deepens bale and crowe's characters.  

speaking of which, both give perfectly nuanced performances here and you can watch their characters grow in response to each other as the movie progresses.  both ""sons"" (lerman and foster) fit into their roles of the naive teen becoming a man, and the unhinged ""son"" idolising his ""father"" respectively.  the rest of the cast have been perfectly chosen. 

the cinematography is stunning at times, but unlike most westerns, this does emphasize the country - it is more of a silent character here.  but when it is shown, it is just gorgeous...seriously, i hadnt seen snow in westerns until this - but it just looks brilliant. 

the score drips with the memories of older, more famous westerns, but beltrami makes this one unique.  sound design is also great, even using the heartbeat-like rhythm of the idling train's engine in the final scene.  

everything else is perfect - the lighting, editing, costumes, set design...this does not look like an independently made film that the major studios didnt want to touch.  the people who worked on this, really wanted to.  and that's also probably why its so good.

jane austen was a nonconformist. she was the seventh child of an anglican priest and belonged to what we might now call the middle class. she had many books at home, and both parents taught her to read and write, supported her, recognized in her the same talent we all know her now. moreover, she was unlucky in love: it does not seem that her parents sought to marry her, it is quite plausible that she did not want to marry for economic reasons and the love affairs that we know of her were short and fruitless. with the publication, very shy, of her first editions, the writer's financial situation improved, and public recognition begin to appear. sadly, the author died quite young, without collect the fruits of her talent.

i am not an expert on jane austen, but this is, very briefly, the author's biography, almost sketched in a stream. the film focuses on her youth and builds romantic fiction around her. personally, i'm dubious about much of what happens in this movie. i think much of it is romantic invention, almost turning austen into one of her own characters, torn between the attention of two very different suitors.

the film is not bad, but it is far from flawless and will never be one of the reference “biopics”, at least in my understanding. julian jarrold's direction was effective, but he gives us a work that bets more on the construction of the characters and the story than on the relationship between the film and the real life of the biographed person. the cinematography is good and there are some good effects. the soundtrack is mediocre. the period recreation was reasonably done, resorting to decent costumes and good locations and sets. in between, however, there are some grotesque errors and anachronisms: in the ball scene, jane appears with a dress twenty years ahead of the time, in another scene we see wedding rings, something that did not exist at that time, and in another one we see jane being recognized as the writer of a novel when, in fact, she published anonymously several of her books and got very little recognition in her lifetime. even her epitaph, on her tomb in winchester cathedral, ignored her literary output until it was replaced by new text in the late 19th century.

in the midst of all this, the extraordinary dramatic interpretation of the actors stands out, and especially anne hathaway, who gave the character a touch of kindness mixed with a marked rebelliousness and nonconformity. she didn't want to be like other women. james mcavoy also does a very interesting job in this film and deserves our full attention. the film also has good performances by james cromwell, julie walters, maggie smith and ian richardson.",low

police constable nicholas angel is the pride of the london service, trouble is is that he is making everybody else look bad, so much so his superiors promote him to sergeant in the sleepy village of sandford, gloucestershire. yet all is not right with sandford as the locals start meeting grizzly deaths, thus thrusting angel into his biggest case so far.

the biggest question on most film goers lips was could the pairing of edgar wright and simon pegg triumphantly follow the monster cult success of shaun of the dead? well the plot premise for hot fuzz hardly leaps out as something to grab the attention span of many, but they have crafted a tremendously funny film that winks at the action genre with genuine love and admiration.

simon pegg and his trusty sidekick, nick frost, clearly have an earthbound appeal that many (even outside of britain) can warm too, not pretty or over svelt, these guys are fans of movies making movies purely for the fans, and it shows. neither pegg or frost try to steal scenes from each other, both men after over a decade of working together are clearly comfortable with their coupling and thus manage to fine tune their working chemistry.

once angel (pegg) lands at sandford village we are introduced to a ream of british village stereotypes (archetypes actually), all characters ripe for hilarious scenarios that our fish out water (big city cop) sergeant struggles to comprehend. we observe as he is dumb struck at the ineptitude of the village police force (erm service actually) and is then forced to work alongside dough eyed constable butterman (a film stealing frost). angel's exasperation at where he finds himself is mirthful joy to us the viewers. the dialogue is priceless, one liners and hat tipping nods to the action genre come thick and fast, in fact you can watch hot fuzz repeatedly and play spot the homage each time. i mean come on people, we got both james bond (a delicious turn from timothy dalton) and belloq in here strutting their stuff. the action set pieces are not found wanting either, director wright having the time of his life with the crash bang wallop that flows in the final third.

the test of a great comedy is how it stands up to repeat viewings, to me hot fuzz delivers no matter how many times it is viewed. for even when you know what is coming up next, the smile on your face is already there before the event, wonderful, wonderful film made by guys who love movies as much as ourselves. 10/10",high

the story itself was okay, but it does have a lot of problems.  my biggest was just their defiance of reality.

the ""in you face"" thing is that the farm is plague with ""crows"" that are clearly ravens.  this is done because you can train ravens much easier, but they're giant birds by average comparison of what size birds most people see.  and then they do stupid things like leave feed out far enough away from where you would take it (those are not light bags), and when birds come, he shoos them farther into the car as the trunk is the only part open.

they are planting sunflower seeds, which just means lots of things trying to eat it, but the timeline is all over the place.  they go to plant seeds, and there are tiny plants in the background.  there is an incident early on, then what seems like a week passes, but then it's almost end of harvest.  and then there is still a giant bag of seeds to plant, and it isn't part of the harvest because it's by itself and i don't think they start harvesting during the movie.

there is also the mold which she doesn't seem to know how to treat or why it would come back...just silly.  but its details like these that show how poorly written the script is, especially the dialogue.

the effects are actually pretty interesting, they did a good job on the birds, the wall, and the ""flowing ground"" was really interesting, but it's not enough to have a cool effect or two.  you might as well, just have lots of odd explosions then.

“the messengers” (2007) is a haunted house flick from the pang brothers of hong kong, which is their first american film. the basic set-up is exactly the same as “cold creek manor” (2003) with the difference of a rundown farmhouse substituting for the woodsy manor. from there it throws in elements of “the grudge” movies mixed with “the amityville horror” and “the birds.” 

while i appreciated the colorful prairie setting, this is easily the least of these because the story is too simplistic and dramatically dull. fans of kristen might be interested though; she was 16 during shooting.

the film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot at indian head and nearby regina, saskatchewan, canada, which are just a couple hours’ drive north of the border of north dakota.

1400,"beowulf hasn't aged well; it looked like crap when it was released in 2007, and it looks like old crap 15 years later. this movie plays like someone made a videogame based (loosely, natch) on the epic poem, then took all the cutscenes out and edited them together into feature length. now, if only beowulf came with an option to skip the cutscenes.

the film features human characters animated using live action motion capture animation, but i fail to see why they even bothered. five years after the lord of the rings: the two towers, which was the first feature film to utilize a real-time motion capture system, the novelty should have surely worn off; moreover, this technology hasn't aged any more gracefully than beowulf has, and even today the best motion capture in the world can't make a silk purse out of the sow's ear that is even the best computer-generated imagery in the world – in fact, putting the two together is just piling crap on top of crap.

it's too bad, because a good live-action film could be made with anthony hopkins, john malkovich, and ray winstone – though not a good live-action beowulf film, mind you, because it would still go the cgi route for grendel and the dragon and who knows what else; a fully animated movie would at least be consistent, or in this case consistently crappy.

not that consistency is something of which one could accuse beowulf; some characters look vaguely like the actors who provide their motions and voices (namely hopkins), while others not at all (malkovich) – and there there's winstone, who looks for all the world like a poorly-rendered digital version of sean bean.",low
1401,"it was just too much...but to be fair i saw it in 3d. the none 3d version may have actually been better, but honestly i have no way of knowing.

at first it was, well, it was wow. i had never actually seen anything in 3d, being far too young for for the first round of popular 3d movies to hit the theater, but my father assured me it was nothing compared to this...

he also assured me it didn't make him as nauseous, and sometimes i can see where he's coming from on that point.

it came out right in the first wave of the new 3d, right when 3d was becoming popular again and actually worth it.

and it was jaw dropping even if some of the motion made my old man sick.

but it was also too much. a new technology and one that was a spectacular in itself, but not exactly tested to perfection.

it seemed like a 14 year-old girl putting on make-up and not yet understanding that less is more.

less than half an hour into it, i had no idea what was going on, the 3d was too distracting to even attempt to follow the plot.

about an hour into it, the 3d got boring, and yes, still over-the-top distracting.

1402,"perfection.

i think i will just come right out and say it from the off, this is a masterpiece, a truly spell binding, mesmerising tour de force that seeps class from every pore. i have often found myself cringing and turning my back on those who use in film debate the tired old defence of ""it's not for everyone"", but here i find i have no choice because this picture is purely for those enamoured with poetic beauty and precision film making at its highest. those in search of an all action gun toting western need not apply, in fact those merely after popcorn fodder to while away an evening viewing should steer well clear. andrew dominik's second directorial effort is a character and dialogue driven piece of work, its thematic heart swirling with intelligence and elegiac beauty.

the story centrers around the final days of notorious outlaw jesse james, and how one of his young disciples came to murder him on april 3rd 1882. using ron hansen's novel as its source, it also fills in the gaps as to what became of the murderer robert ford as regards the subsequent aftermath of killing the infamous jesse james. the film is dealing with issues all to prevalent in modern day society, we are witnessing perhaps the first instance of celebrity status gone berserker, we see how the press glamorise the nasty piece of work that was jesse james, turning him into some sort of quintessential noble outlaw. we observe a stalking menace yearning to be like his hero, a young and impressionable fellow who's hurtling towards infamy completely oblivious of the pitfalls and irony of it all.

structually the film is perfect, and to me the film defines the old saying of art on the silver screen. the performances of the lead actors are incredible, brad pitt gives a career high as jesse james, all teetering villainy yet perfectly befitting the prince charming outlaw persona so gleefully built up by the press. sam rockwell is charley ford, and here he proves that movie big wigs really need to start giving the guy some more dramatic roles to get his teeth in to. yet as good as pitt & rockwell are, both men are left trailing in the wake of casey affleck's performance as robert ford, childish emotion fused with flecks of dark undercurrents as affleck layers a perfect show. how the academy chose to ignore this performance should be seen as an act of treason against american cinema.

few films have left me open mouthed in admiration at the quality on show, but shot after shot, frame after frame, this really is as gorgeous as it comes. roger deakins photography sublimely pleasing the eyes at every edit, be it lush rolling hills cloaked in snow, or shadowy figures appearing like ghosts from locomotive smoke, with deakins firmly cementing his reputation as a master of his craft. the score from nick cave & warren ellis perfectly captures the ambiance and texture of the piece, with cave himself bagging a cameo performance as a bar room busker. it's incredible to think that this is only director andrew dominik's second feature film, following on from the hugely enjoyable chopper in 2000, it is now evident that new zealand can lay claim to producing a talent that if all goes to plan, will go on to become a director to rank up with the best of them.

as it is, and just right now, the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford should be filed along side vertigo as a member of that club that only admits the greatest american films of all time, and that be even if it was directed by a kiwi, wink wink america.

1403,"peerless precision from fincher.

i have seen it written that this film shows that fincher had grown up, and whilst i understand that train of thought, it simply isn't true. what fincher has done is give a true story his meticulous care and standard deft precision by leaving no stone unturned. we get simply one of the (if not thee) best films to deal with the investigating process of a high profile serial killer, a film that as a character study is actually essential viewing in the pantheon of genre productions.

the devilish greatness of this film is in the fact that it can't pay off with a pandering mainstream ending, the makers are telling a true story and any sort of research will lead viewers to the fact that there is no twist here, no joyous ticket selling round of applause at this ending, it is what it is, frustratingly brilliant. the case the film is about consumes all involved with it, and to see how it affects those involved is engrossing (yet sad) because if the viewer is so inclined to jump on board then it will consume you as well, the film and the actors within demand you see this for the affecting character piece it is.

the acting here gives me hope that classic acting is alive and well in this generation, i was once not enamoured with mark ruffalo in his early days as an actor, but here he puts such heartfelt verve into the role of david toschi i felt i need to send him a written apology!. robert downey junior is joyous as paul avery, all 60s chic and swagger without tipping over the edge of the mountain caricature (both men to become future avengers of course). yet surprisingly to me i found that it is jake gyllenhaal as robert graysmith who is the film's key axis, the central heartbeat, with a performance that demands undivided attention, a performance brought about by fincher's quest for perfection from everything to do with film making. gyllenhaal hated working on the film, he hated fincher's work ethic, but in time he must now look back and see that here the director coaxed out a performance that has in time been seen as not only great, but also beneficial to his career (hello nightcrawler).

this is not se7en 2, and british film mags like empire should have known better than to use that tag line to get the readers' attention, because fans of serial killer thrillers need not apply here, fans of outstanding cinema about the human psyche during the pursuit of a serial killer - well get in line folks, for this is one of the best movies of the decade. 10/10",high

1406,"two years before zodiac, capote depicted truman capote making a fuss about possibly not having an ending for his seminal true crime novel in cold blood. robert graysmith, on whose non-fiction books zodiac is based, had no such qualms, nor did director david fincher. the comparison may be unfair; graysmith is no capote (but then, who is?), and in cold blood isn’t a whodunit – though technically neither is zodiac, since after more than two hours we don’t learn who [has] done it so much as who-a-very-small-group-of-people-think-done-it. in a nutshell, this is a movie about a hunch.

the film would work better (and that’s not to say it doesn’t work at all) if it were, like capote, about a man obsessed with a crime and those who have committed it – especially considering that the zodiac killings constitute arguably the most famous unsolved murder case in american history; unfortunately, fincher is what james randi would have called a true believer, and zodiac leaves little doubt that the director is as persuaded that arthur leigh allen (john carroll lynch) was the zodiac as he is that herman mankiewicz singlehandedly wrote the script for citizen kane.

zodiac is a better movie than mank, however, because fincher was more in possession of his faculties in 2007 than in 2020; accordingly, the former film makes a more coherent and convincing case for its thesis than does the latter (and even this we can attribute to the credibility of a very deep roster of skilled supporting players in addition to the rock-solid core of leading men-cum-character actors in the most prominent roles), although it still boils down to a ‘what if?’ scenario. so flimsy in fact is the entire house of cards that the story ends – or rather comes to a halt (lacking, as noted above, a logical conclusion) – on a fallacious note: “just because you can't prove it, doesn't mean it's not true.” it’d be a lot more reassuring if you could, though.",low
1407,"the reaping harvests souls of the religiously devoted by subjecting them to this. “what hath god wrought?”. if ever there was a tagline that would instantly persuade audiences to leap up from their sofas, drive to the nearest cinema complex and purchase a couple of tickets, it’s this one. sure, using a phrase from the book of numbers (as opposed to exodus which is the primary plot device of the film...) certainly sets the religiously inclined tone, that eventually dissolves into the plagued river of blood but more on that later. it also indicates the unimaginative stupidity that ensues, leaving logic and science behind for a faith-based apocalyptic tale that is in need of some serious stoning. a professor in debunking miracles is invited to investigate a “river of blood” in the nearby town of haven, but is quickly ensnared in an apocalyptic mystery.

whilst not the worst horror film in the existence of cinema, with a tepid schlocky tone that somewhat juxtaposes the devoted christian ideologies presented, yet is so inexplicably dumb that it will leave you questioning why such a film was created in the first place. its initial introduction commenced with much promise. science against religion. simple logical explanations explaining what many describe as religious miracles. yes, it’s relatively on the nose and misses the point of acquiring faith, yet remained an interesting direction for the first half that managed to conjure up various problematic conversations.

hot off her oscar win, swanky swank muddles through this unusual mystery with much trepidation, choosing not to believe that the plagues of egypt condemning haven are in fact coincidental, offering scientific explanations. algae bloom for the “blood river” that has the consistency of red-dyed water (sorry not sorry...). infections terminating frogs, that is never explained how they fell from the sky, but whatever. flies consuming the flesh of the frogs, and you get the idea. she remains unconvinced throughout these biblical mishaps, and provides an interesting angle.

well, that is until about halfway through when she switches from being bill nye the science guy to pope francis of the vatican. suddenly she has faith, despite her tragic backstory clumsily spliced with the main plot, and holy reaping balls do events get crazy. cgi locust infestation, satanic cult crazes and a thunderstorm of fire that incinerates life in a matter of seconds. it went from a minor science experiment to absolute chaos, quicker than a snap of your fingers. the change of pace is so jarring and bewildering, that when the predictably obtuse third act arrives you’re stunned into silence. the tantalising debunking approach now plagued by, well, the plagues. the mystery is ham-fisted and makes no sense whatsoever. constant flashbacks providing clues, more like clear answers mind you, were choppy and fragmented. it’s not scary in the slightest. main characters are expended and forgotten about almost instantly, a shame considering elba was decent as always. and what’s rea’s purpose in this? no seriously. except for providing basic exposition, he seemed pointless in this endeavour.

a very minuscule part of my soul wants to like this for being the barking mad mystery that it is. to an extent, it is watchable if you know to turn your brain off and devour all the spiel on religious provocations, despite the interesting first act. it has this surreal allure, making each watch tolerable. but then i think back to the last thirty minutes and i then really want to experience all ten plagues for myself. incomprehensibly ludicrous. what hath god wrought you ask? this.",low

1413,"**a historian should not watch this film without a medical team nearby.**

my problem with films set in the past, or about historical facts, is that my academic background in history prevents me from lightly accepting everything that the filmmakers want to make me swallow. that's why i was so harsh in the reviews i wrote about some films here, and everything indicates that, to major sadness of my heart, i will continue to have this problem. okay, cinema must have its creative freedom, and it is also necessary to fill information gaps (we don't know everything about the past), but even creative freedom must recognize logical limits.

today, we know without a doubt that scandinavian navigators – who have been called “vikings” – were the first europeans to arrive in north america. what we still don't know is whether they were aware of it! could they have maintained contact with native american people in the region where they landed? personally, it seems clear to me. were there conflicts? i don't know, archeology might discover more about this. is it legitimate to say that the vikings discovered america? yes, if we find out that they knew they had arrived at another continent. until then, no: not even columbus had that awareness.

the film takes this first contact between amerindians and europeans and creates a story of blood and violence: on the one hand, the amerindians are portrayed as simple, friendly peasants who live in harmony with nature and who have their land invaded, and the nordics are bloodthirsty savages who kill for pleasure. furthermore, the script uses the historical fact to draw a parallel with the future european colonization of america in which, supposedly, europeans return to invade and massacre “inferior” peoples for the pleasure of seeing blood flow. these are parallels that i even understand, given the modern need to demonize any european colonization enterprise. current society, especially in the americas, feels the urgency to condemn the colonial past of the old world, forgetting that it is a daughter of that same world and that it is not so different from what it was in the past, in vices and virtues. these kinds of parallels and revisionist needs reveal a lot about the way we see the past, and are enemies of historical truthfulness.

in short, this is what makes this film a piece of garbage that i don't recommend to anyone, and to these problems are added the usual untruths and factual errors about vikings, from the damn horned helmet that everyone should already know is pure fiction to the indistinct use of any apparently medieval sword, apparently arab horses and many iron armors, made with technology that would only appear four hundred years later. i'm not the best person to talk about indigenous people, but i believe that experts in the culture and traces of these people may have some heart problems after seeing this film.

is there anything good in this movie? well, yes… the film was very well filmed and makes good use of the landscapes and filming locations. for action fans, the film has good fight scenes, well choreographed and quite creative (sometimes even too much). the soundtrack isn't bad, it does its job flawlessly. russel means was pretty decent in his role, but he's literally the only member of the cast to deserve any kind of spotlight, and i can't even consider him doing a remarkable job.",low
1414,"are you an angel? has the time come? i've been waiting so long.  

we are in the not too distant future and the sun is fading out. after a first mission to reignite it with a nuclear bomb fails, with the ship apparently lost in space, a new team are sent to try again. but it really isn't as simple as that...

director danny boyle and writer alex garland team up once again for this sci-fi adventure thriller. for as long as i can personally remember, outer space and the planets that dwell within it, have always served us well for cinematic treats. fears of the unknown and worries over the destruction of earth, by and large make for great premise's. not all films realise this potential of course, but it always makes for a great starting point. for his first venture into this realm, boyle has gone for the sun as his point of reference, and it makes for a marvellously claustrophobic picture that poses as many questions as it does answers. and even tho ultimately the science fiction aspects of it do not naturally add up, it's dazzling in its visuals and thought provoking into the bargain.

boyle has never hid his influences and favourites from the public, and here he homages everything from alien to event horizon, stopping for tea and crumpets at 2001s house along the way. but that is no bad thing, molding elements from great sci-fi past with his own intriguing story has given sunshine a tremendous heart, to which boyle then manages to cloak it with high quality drama. the crew are up there and we know that this is a genre piece and things invariably go wrong, this gives the discerning viewer an eager anticipation, a sense that one shouldn't go to the toilet for something will be missed. and boyle lives up to the promise showed, such a pity then, that boyle didn't let us get better acquainted with his characters at the start. because then the impact would surely have doubled as each perilous and wrought scenario unfolded.

having racked up the tension and intrigued us with the premise, expertly fusing cgi with his own craft work along the way, boyle's sunshine lives or dies by it's last quarter; depending on your proclivity of course. it has proved to be a most divisive point with critics and fans alike. to say it's a genre shift accompanied with implausibility is being a touch unkind i feel, this is after all a sci-fi picture about a ship going to reignite the sun! never the less it doesn't quite close the film triumphantly after the twists that preceded it, turns and explosions have lulled the viewers in, but personally it satisfies this entertained observer. not in a big bang dynamic way, but in the way that asks me for a further thought process, and that may just be what boyle and garland envisaged when they sat down to make the film? again, depending on your proclivity of course! 8.5/10",high

for this movie:
uninspired watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend, unless you're already a simpsons fan.

it's really just a lot of the simpsons being simpsons, but that also means that the overall story writing is actually pretty good, even if the character writing is rather repetitive.

i did enjoy the introduction of ploppers, spider-pig, but it doesn't really even out everything else.

the big adversity is an ""under the dome"" scenario, which is actually interesting enough to explore, but because it's the simpsons, we know that nothing ultimately interesting is going to happen, and that everything is going to resolve like its tv counterpart.  now, that said, the tv show does drop unexpected, unexplainable shifts, like the death of characters.  i don't think fox was brave enough to put such a thing in the movie, which would have completely changed the gravity of the movie.

death defying acts is directed by gillian armstrong and written by tony grisoni and brian ward. it stars guy pearce, catherine zeta-jones, timothy spall and saoirse ronan. music is by cezary skubiszewski and cinematography by haris zambarloukos.

not a biopic of harry houdini, but an episode in his life, death defying acts (a bum steer of a title) is lukewarm across the board. story charts the years after the death of houdini’s mother, where he travels to 1920s edinburgh and falls in with psychic tricksters mary (jones) and benji mcgarvie (ronan), a mother and daughter team who spy an opportunity to prise a cash reward offered by the great escapologist.

what is intended to be a searching examination of houdini, his mental fragility, hang-ups, strengths and etc, just plays out as a romantic period piece lacking vim and vigour. pearce works hard as houdini but never gets to grasp the tormented angle of the man, while jones is miscast and not even her pretty face can light up a dull performance. ronan is sprightly enough and spall shows some emotive verve as houdini’s concerned manager. the moments of trickery perk things up a bit, but even then the makers think it’s wise to debunk the mysticism. the romanticism of the era, and that of houdini’s place in it, is well crafted onto the screen, but the flatness and confused thematic threads elsewhere leave this well below average. 4/10",low

no country for old men is directed by joel coen and ethan coen, and the coen's adapt the screenplay from cormac mccarthy's novel of the same name. it stars tommy lee jones, javier bardem, josh brolin, woody harelson, javier bardem and kelly macdonald. music is by carter burwell and cinematography by roger deakins.  

when a hunter stumbles upon the bloody aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, he decides to make off with cash left at the scene, that violence and life threat will follow from here on in...

not quite the genius masterpiece some would have you believe, this is however and decidedly dark, sombre, gothic type thriller with noir shadings. the ultimate message slowly pulsing away is one of how making a fateful decision can shape the course of many people's lives, with fate ready at various junctures to trip you up. 

the coen's and mccarthy are not in it to offer hope for a better world, this really is a life stinks and is evil narrative, none more so than portrayed by bardem's chilling psycopath. the unpredictable nature of the story keeps things on the high heat, even as deakins brings beauty via his colour photography, his teaming with the coen's brings visual smarts.

the screenplay is tightly formed, giving the actors something great to work with, and as they respond in kind, while we the audience are drawn in close to the slow burning madness. it definitely finds the brothers coen returning to their best, as they take mccarthy's melancholic machismo and drip their self aware irony over proceedings. 

the finale lacks a punch, and in fact it's a little boorish, while this narrative has been done well before in film noirs of the original wave - so it's not as fresh and exciting to us more mature film lovers. yet it's still a great piece of film making, the like we could do with more regularly. 9/10

""no country for old men"" presents the sadist in the usual hollywood formula of being immortal and godlike. in ""nightfall"", the sadist is a mortal. ""no country"" endeavors to contrive every bit of the story to show that if you're sadistic enough, you are immortal, the true hollywood formula since about 1965. (godfather and other gangster movies, leone westerns, almost all horror movies e.g.).

1467,"a soldier disappears after he has come back from iraq. his father, hank deerfield (tommy lee jones), is alerted and sets off in the hopes of finding his son. he soon finds out that his son was actually killed, brutally you might say, his body cut up and burned. the evidence lead in no real directions, but it soon becomes apparent that his army bodies are lying, also, the images that hank recovers from his son's phone, seem to suggest that something happened in iraq.

to say anything more would be to ruin the movie. however, this movie is not just a crime story, where we follow the father and cop (charlize theron) as they get to the bottom of the mystery. this is a story about war, the people in it and at hoome, as well as bravery and sorrow. it is told carefully, and with skillfully precision by the entire cast, and paul haggis.

by the end, we don't even really care about the murder being solved, just that the father finally made peace with his son. he understands better than anyone what war does to a man, you can see that clearly in his eyes  throughout the movie.

only one thing bothered me about this movie, and it is actually something that bothers me quite often. music. i don't mind music in movies, i don't even mind music that enhances a certain emotion, sorrow, happiness etc. no, what bothers me is that moviemakers feel that they need music so badly, when really, they don't. more often than not, the images and actors speak the words clearly, we don't need the sad tones to emphasize what we are already feeling. it's not that bad in this movie, but i did notice it a few times, where it bothered me.

_last words... don't watch this movie and feel like you need to ""figure it out"". it's not about that at all, just allow yourself to be swept away be the amazing cast and let the story onfold itself in front of you. this is not a story about a crime, but a story about a father... and a son._",high

it examined something and then it took that examination and turned it into a story... like science fiction should.

but on to the movie itself. this is a spanish language movie with subtitles, but that didn’t detract from my enjoyment of it. it is nicely set up and cleverly done. at one point i guessed right about a little plot twist i saw coming, but there was much more i didn’t predict, which brings us back to how glad i am i didn’t watch that preview. i expect this was a low budget film and there aren’t many characters in it, so don’t expect a glitzy production with awesome special effects. it just tells the story. i did feel like hector made a couple of really stupid decisions along the way, but i cut it some slack because without them we have a boring half-hour movie!

*** this review may contain spoilers ***

some of you may find (or i should say try to) faults in this gripping courtroom drama but for the rest this movie is a lovely, more than just about courtroom, dual between the ever talented anthony hopkins and the not just about looks ryan gosling.the chemistry between the two is really difficult to not feel right from the first time in the courtroom where the hannibal lecterish crawford gestures beachum to adjust his bow tie.it is amazing how the movie grips you despite knowing the fact right from the start who is the killer.though crawford is too smart to be believable, the way its played it doesn't raise the slightest of doubt in your mind about its actual existence.beachum's urge to put the devilish crawford behind bars for trying to kill his wife and then getting away with it can be seen greatly in the scene in the hospital when beachum tries to stop crawford from pulling the plug of his wife's ventilator.the only thing i found missing was the almost lifeless, short lived, romantic relation of crawford and nikki gardner(rosamund pike who looks stunning in the movie).maybe it wouldn't have helped the movie's plot in any way except crawford's asking for a favor from gardner's dad later in the movie that's why they didn't put too much efforts to make them a couple.in all a great courtroom, psychological, thrilling, drama with great acting.and i'd better not forget to mention david strathairn's portrayal of da lobruto which was too good and i'd have loved to see more of him... don't miss this one if you like an intriguing courtroom drama!!",high

this stinks, it really does, and this coming from a man who owns and loves many a cheese filled b/z movie. although i would in no way say that avp: alien vs. predator (2004) was a good movie, i have a tiny soft spot and found it watchable at least, this hack job makes that film seem like the pinnacle of creature feature nirvana. 

a predator ship encounters problems on board by way of a newly born predator/alien hybrid, it crash lands on earth (america) and thus requiem is born as face huggers go crazy, aliens run amok, predator fights back, and the cast of genre stereotypes kill or be killed, the end! all the makers have done here (apart from attempting to kill off the franchise it seems) is splice together various staples from the other films in the series. be it the settings or confrontations, they have just upped the blood quota, the film has no substance what so ever. characters so dense and unlikeable you root for the monsters by way of having no choice, dumb teens in angst, rambo mom, ex-convict trying to do good, you name it and chances are you have seen it in other rubbish murder death kill movies. 

there is gore galore which i'm sure will appease the easily pleased, and in one particularly monstrous scene involving a pregnant woman, a sequence for the squeamish to chat on the playground about come monday morning. but you honestly would be better off watching some cheap no budget slasher film from the 70s, because unlike the money backed hack directors here, they had an excuse back then. drek 1/10",low

<em>'american gangster'</em> delivers in every area it needs to. enthralling premise, immaculate music, phenomenal casting and great pacing. i was surprised slightly with how it finishes, but it's far and away from a disappointing/underwhelming conclusion.

not much really needs to be said about denzel washington and russell crowe. they're exactly how you'd expect them to be, outstanding! washington is fantastic as frank, while crowe is superb as richie. you have to wait a while for their proper screen time together, but it's worth the time it takes.

away from the leads, you have a load of recognizable faces - i was literally that rick dalton meme for the first 45-60 mins! chiwetel ejiofor (huey) and josh brolin (trupo) have sizeable roles, though there's also appearances from carla gugino (laurie), cuba gooding jr. (nicky), idris elba (tango) and norman reedus (norman). excellent casting, that!

i was expecting slow moments due to the run time, but there aren't any - at least in my opinion. as noted, the way it ends is a tad differently to how i would've predicted, but i still enjoyed it alongside the rest of the it.

1517,"**it has some points of merit, but lacks neutrality.**

i was too young in 1999 to remember this world trade organization meeting. however, i am fully aware that this type of summit is usually a rallying point for demonstrators in favor of a thousand ideals: rebels without a cause, anarchists, socialists, communists, environmentalists, conspiracy theorists...

i don't really know what happened, but there is no doubt that these protests were violent and, to a certain extent, they managed to achieve their objectives, severely disrupting the summit and the life of the city, and becoming a juicier and more relevant matter than the summit itself. in the following summits, there was more care. i could make a series of considerations around the real usefulness of the wto, or even if there aren't other ways to encourage a greater trade flow and greater ease in commercial exchanges between countries, making it possible to end this, apparently questionable, organization. but one thing i learned in my life: the owners of money usually win these wars, even if they lose some battles along the way.

the film is very competently directed by stuart townsend. the director does not hide that his heart and admiration are with the protesters in the streets, and the film is not neutral about that. thus, we witness the glorification of peaceful protests, the demonization of authorities (even though the police are portrayed as men who only do their job) and even the exposure of many of those who, under the cover of protests, broke and burned things just because it seemed a good idea. personally, i would have preferred a more neutral approach, because if the idea was to demonize the economy and the wto, it should have been better contextualized.

the cast has some well-known names, and martin henderson turns out to be one of the actors who deserve our applause. he's done a good job, he's in excellent shape, and he's used the material he's been given very well to give personality and depth to his character. i also really liked the performance of charlize theron, in the role of her wife. ray liotta is very good in the role of a mayor who is overtaken by events. the rest of the cast, however, i felt didn't stand out, and didn't do much more than they really had to.

the film has an extraordinary cinematic beauty, as it manages to recreate very well what was experienced on the streets during those days in december 1999. the way in which everything was recreated is pleasantly aesthetic without losing any kind of credibility or realism. the sets (streets) and costumes also help a lot and the cinematography makes good use of gas fumes and light and shadow effects, in addition to a series of moving camera shots, which transport us to the middle of the action.",low
1522,"the more i watch this movie, the more convinced i become that this movie is _less_ about the mist as a horrific result of military experiments gone awry, and _more_ a commentary on the fear of death and the unknown beyond.

the mist and its lovecraftianesque creatures are symbolic of humanity's existential dread and the abject fear that there is quite possibly nothing else but this, and the end here is the end forever; or even worse, that what lies beyond is not a benevolent creator, but rather an entity that either is indifferent to our existence and our plights, or is actively malevolent against us. jean-paul sartre described this fear as ""existential nausea.""

mrs. carmody's ever growing religious cult was the very opposite extreme. she proclaimed to be a prophet of the one true god, yet was hypocritical, judgmental and quick to cast stones even in light of her own sins. her fundamentalist extremism insured they _never_ escaped their box. but what seemed the logical end result of her many violent transgressions only served to martyr her in the eyes of other extremists -- as it so often does -- and serves, in their twisted minds, as vindication of what they've been preaching all along.

and there are those who simply did the best they could with the circumstances they were given, but in the process, did not sacrifice the wills of others for their own gain while simultaneously giving of themselves unto the service of others. no one can say with absolute certainty what lies in wait beyond this life, but we shouldn't squander the moments we _do_ have on this earth entombed in fear and letting that fear manipulate us into becoming the monsters we sometimes create ourselves.

the end of this movie has always been, in my opinion, the most tragic. the ending was _almost_ a happy one, if only they'd held out for a few moments longer. but in relation to the underlying theme laid out above, this group of people's break from the store to the car to the literal end of the road was metaphorical of venturing out into the unknown, even if it means leaving the comfort yet unstable illusion of safety and well-being, to take our chances navigating life the best we know how. we may feel as if ultimately the only thing we have any control over is when and how we die, but even this is just another illusion.",high

**i love the simplicity of once** -  feels more raw and natural (than sing steet and begin again). and the songs are really beautiful. i have been listening to it everyday. my top 2 favorite scenes are: falling slowly (video above) at the music shop - instant connection through music! doesn’t have to be a love story between the guy and the girl, just relate and connect for their love for making music. second one would be the recording studio scene: when your mind’s made up. i love how the guy who’s ‘pressing the buttons’ was like meh just here to work with whatever wannabee band, and then when they start to play he’s like…what is this? this is actually good - support! and from there it’s just something magical for all of them, that you know these musicians are in their element and will remember it for the rest of their lives, doing something that they are all so passionate about. everyone inside the studio - just very endearing characters.  

well i love the whole film so all the scenes are great. my favorite emotional song, lies. it’s so powerful and heartbreaking, i think most relateable scene as well.

challenge: make an indy hit with a tiny budget; ""no name"" actors in there; and use actors with no or limited acting experience.  have the plot be basic (guy meets girl early on), but realistic.  keep the characters relatable and add humour.  now make it a musical with at least 10 tracks.  oh and also, make sure an oscar is won.  

this is just what this movie achieved and im blown away by it.  

hansard and irglova are so believable in their roles, i didnt know they had such limited act experience.  and the music they make together is glorious, heart felt and raw.

warning: spoilers
 
death proof is directed and written by quentin tarantino. it's part of a double feature production that tarantino and robert rodriguez released as grindhouse. with rodriguez contributing planet terror. death proof tells of a psychopathic stunt man played by kurt russell who stalks pretty young ladies and then murders them by way of road accidents caused by his ""death proofed"" stunt car. joining russell in the cast are zoë bell, rosario dawson, vanessa ferlito, jordan ladd, sydney tamiia poitier, tracie thoms, mary elizabeth winstead and rose mcgowan.

many trials and tribulations followed the release of the grindhouse project; poor opening weekend, two film's meant to be together ultimately separated on disc, with different cuts etc etc. it's all rather boorish in truth and really both death proof and planet terror stand up on their own two feet even if the whole ""grindhouse"" homage"" is somewhat lost in home viewing. so on to death proof, a film that finds tarantino on deliciously agreeable form. delivering a chicksploitation psycho killer piece that bubbles nicely under the surface to then explode into one of the most thrilling finales in recent times.

now in its longer cut, death proof is split into two parts. the first part has one group of girls (poitier, ladd & ferlito) out in austin, texas, celebrating the birthday of one of them. it's here we are introduced to stuntman mike (a terrific russell), who is stalking them. for this first half there's lots of talk and relationship posers plotting away. it's a slow build, and in light of qt's pre release promise of 200mph thrills, it may lose some viewers hungry for action and murder death kill from the off. but hang in there, listen to the dialogue, get to know the characters, particularly the girls (how often do we get to know victims in slashers eh?), and then bang! pay off number one as carnage is unleashed in multi-angles and action replays. a memorable blood show played out to the awesome drum beats of dave dee, dozy, beaky, mick & titch's pop classic hold tight.

part two. and our second group of girls, an aesthetically pleasing bunch that contains zoë bell, mary elizabeth winstead, tracie thoms & rosario dawson. again there's much talk, but oh what talk. these are girls i could sit and listen to for ever. this may not be qt's most quotable movie, but it isn't shy of coolness in the writing. just sample the whole gun conversation as the camera revolves around the table, a sharp sharp moment in the film; all that's missing is a madonna story, you know? some may argue it's indulgent from the director, i say it's finding a director very relaxed and at one with his protect. besides, it's a critical passage of play that's setting us up for the exhilarating climax as bell (real life stunt-woman) straps herself to the bonnet of a speeding dodge challenger. what follows is ripping cinema, free of cgi and string work, not only does qt homage those car movies of the 70s he loves so much (vanishing point, dirty mary crazy larry et al), but he's also patting the back of the stunt-men and women who bring so many action moments to life. and as this long car chasing sequence raises the pulses, it starts to unravel that death proof is subverting the norm. bravo boys and girls.

hilarious, riotous, troubling, sexy and sleazy, death proof is unsurprisingly proving divisive. but i for one wouldn't be at all surprised if in ten years time it is regarded as being one of his best movies. the grindhouse project may not have worked as a whole, but this portion on its own provides thrills and cheek in equal measure as tarantino gets behind the wheel and takes us on one hell of a ride. kicking soundtrack too! 9/10",high

1549,"**an excellent film, which only loses a little in some details related to the writing of the script and the conception of some characters.**

i'm not a fan of superhero movies, but like any movie fan in general, i've seen a good handful of them. this was the first film made by marvel and financed by the company itself, and it brings us one of its most acclaimed heroes. the film shows how a young playboy millionaire named tony stark, with a fortune inherited from his father and largely made from the production and sale of weapons, becomes a vigilante determined not to allow the misuse of the weapons he sells. i don't know much about comics, but i believe that the film was limited to adapting to the cinema a story already written on paper about the origins of the character, giving it, perhaps, a touch of the present.

the plot is one of the strongest points of the film, not only for the way it introduces the character in the context of the current geopolitical conflicts (with the middle east issue very present), but mainly for the way it transforms tony stark into a deeper character, who lives a catharsis that opens his conscience to questions that he was not sensitive enough to understand. put more simply, if initially stark was a rich and spoiled idiot, he ends the movie with another awareness of what he should do and how his attitudes influence the world around him. however, i also felt that once stark realizes what he has to do, and it becomes clear who the enemy is to defeat, the script quickly loses quality and becomes much more basic and underdeveloped.

with a skillful direction provided by jon favreau, the cast gave us a very good performance. of course, the public's attention is focused on robert downey jr., an actor who started working in the 80s, but only began to emerge at the turn of the millennium, with some productions (*gothika*, *good night and good luck*, *zodiac*) that he entered before accepting marvel's proposal. he is perfect in character and gives us his life's work as an actor. beside him, we can still admire gwynneth paltrow, in a more discreet but competent role. the villain was secured by jeff bridges, but his work is not so well executed and the actor sometimes doesn't seem to know exactly how to behave in the character.

what can we say about the production values ​​and technical quality of a movie with a millionaire budget of 140 million dollars? it is a film determined to be a blockbuster, which fully achieved all its objectives, earning high profits, pleasing the fans and achieving high praise from the general public and the specialized critics. and the money invested is in plain sight, with a declared bet on very high quality cgi, wonderfully well-executed sound and image effects and really good sets and costumes (with great emphasis - obviously - on iron man's suit and stark's mansion). the cinematography is excellent, the filming work was really well done, and the editing was detailed, giving the film a pleasant rhythm that doesn't tire us out. finally, a note of praise for the excellent and epic soundtrack.",high

this is a good film to watch with the family because it will easily appeal to young people and adults alike. however, i think it never received the attention it deserved, perhaps due to the fact that it was released at a time when the fantasy genre was dominated by a group of other much stronger and more relevant films. the film also strives to show the hidden side of knowledge as something dangerous, less than desirable, following the logic of “there are things we simply shouldn’t know”.

the story begins when a recently divorced woman moves with her children to a rustic house in the forest, which belongs to a great-aunt hospitalized as crazy. this house has been closed for a long time, there is salt on all the windows and an industrial amount of tomato sauce and honey in the kitchen pantry. intriguing. it is quite evident from the beginning that the brothers get along badly, and that the youngest is very attached to his father and waits for him to return. and it is precisely he who begins to hear noises that convince him that there is something more in the house. he discovers a book with a dark warning, but still decides to read it, finding himself in the power of a series of hidden knowledge that should never have reached him, and that were collected eighty years earlier by a great-uncle, who disappeared without a trace.

like i said, it's a good film and tells a good story. the characters are good, from the humans to the enchanted figures, and there's a lot of entertainment and creativity here. it didn't have a great reception in america, but it was a success in europe and continues to appear on television from time to time. directed by mark waters, who already has some experience in films for young people, but was far from being a name to consider from the outset, it has a good group of actors. freddie highmore shows talent and commitment, which opened many doors for him in the following years, and irishwoman sarah bolger is not far behind. david strathairn and joan plowright are the adult actors who deserve the most praise for their efforts here. both were very good, and brought credible and adorably magical characters to life. nick nolte also makes a cameo appearance.

technically, the film relies heavily on high-quality cgi, great visual impact and scenic effect. there's no doubt that there was a lot of money invested in the visuals and cinematography, and it paid off: the film doesn't feel unrealistic or overly fanciful. the enchanted objects and characters seem realistic, worthy of the credit we want to give them. the colors are magnificent, the light is ideal, the studio filming was well done and the house where the film takes place is visually magnificent, worthy of a fairy tale. james horner provides the soundtrack in an effective but not memorable way.",high

1558,"this movie is in my top 10 movie list in life. it is a cinema achievement that may never be outdone by 'anyone'. considering that this masterpiece was shot digitally in 2007, it is miles above any cg effort since.

for those of you that haven't seen it: ""see it"". besides a great story (with one flaw), this film makes illusion and simulation become reality. 

the one flaw: i have great respect for david fincher, and i am going to go out on a limb and say that he must have been aware of this discrepancy, but went ahead with the story-line as written anyway. ( i hope that's the case).
benjamin button was born ""old"", and regressed backwards to die an infant. the flaw in the story-line (and it's a big one), is that as he regresses to youth, he begins to have dementia (alzheimer's symptoms), along with all of the arthritic pains and problems an old man gets as he ages. at the end, before he dies he loses his memory completely.

logically, since he was born an old man, those illnesses should have evolved from birth, and improved as he regressed in age. strangely in the film, he is born with severe arthritis, and can't even walk until he is 7. why then would he again experience these same symptoms as a child on the way to his death bed (or crib)? he should be in perfect health as a child, and regress to a ""fetus"", and then disappear.  

other than that major flaw, this movie is a 10. unfortunately because of the illogical way he dies, i had to give it a 9 out of 10 stars.

one other issue with the plot: if we were to take this movie scenario and try to place it in the real world, benjamin would have to have been born a ""full sized"", old man, and then after 70 or 80 years, he would have begun to shrink. since the idea of a woman giving birth to a full sized man is physically impossible, our benjamin had to be born old and ""tiny"". this of course is another contradiction in the plot, since benjamin is small ""twice in his life"". we can't dwell on this flaw at all, because if we did we would never get passed it. to enjoy this movie, we must put all the facts and logistics of this scenario aside, and when we do, this movie takes us on a journey unlike any other ever filmed.

hancock had character at the start of the film, but that slowly faded away by the second half, that just sort of floundered until it ended.

it just seemed to fail on every front.",low
1565,"**despite being one of the great films of will smith's career, it is a weak and uninteresting film.**

i think almost everyone who has seen superhero movies, especially the bigger budget ones, has wondered how it's possible that those heroes are so destructive: in order to eliminate an enemy or a danger, they destroy half a city as collateral damage. this film works precisely on top of that: hancock is a superhero who doesn't seem to want to be one, and who doesn't know how to deal with it. as a result, and despite being effective at what he does, he is quite destructive and unpopular until the day he gets an image manager.

although will smith is one of those actors that i never really appreciated very much, i have to admit that he did a lot of good to bet on this film. the character is perfect for the actor, who seems to be as charismatic as he is grumpy, and smith's effort turns out to be the big reason to see the film. smith gives us a very well done job and manages to bear the effort and responsibility of the protagonist with great capacity. charlize theron also deserves a positive note for the work she left us in this film. jason bateman brings to life the most likeable and palatable character in the film, but he doesn't have the material to match his colleagues.

unfortunately, beyond the work of smith and his co-stars, the film doesn't really have much else to offer us. the script starts from a very interesting idea, but fails to flesh it out and develops it in a very inefficient way. the result ends up being a frankly uneven film, where a good beginning leads to a dull stagnation and, later, a highly predictable and tiring ending. on a technical level, we can highlight, on a positive note, the quality of the cinematography and cgi effects used, as well as the effective and properly used soundtrack. everything else is simply boring and not worthy of particular mention.",low

1579,"_**intense with more depth than you might think**_

john rambo (sylvester stallone) is alone, bitter and living hand-to-mouth in thailand when a group of christian missionaries enlist him to take them into burma (aka myanmar) to aid a village. rambo discourages them in light of the political instability, which includes persecutions and mass slayings, but they insist. weeks later he learns that the missionaries are missing so he goes back with a group of mercenaries.

""rambo"" (2008) is the fourth installment in the franchise after ""first blood"" (1982), ""rambo: first blood part ii"" (1985) and ""rambo iii"" (1988). i'm a huge fan of the first one, which i think is an action/adventure masterpiece, but the next two films are too comic-booky and the characters are cardboard, although stallone never looked better and the locations are fabulous. 

this third sequel makes up for that because it's not comic booky at all and there's quite a bit of depth, albeit not much in dialogue form. it combines elements of ""apocalypse now,"" ""the killing fields"" & the first two rambo films and is grim & intense from beginning to end, not to mention it's one of the most violent films ever made. the picture powerfully illustrates the best and worst in humanity. the christian missionaries are willing to risk everything to help the villagers, whereas the myanmar militarists revel in slaughtering scores of unarmed people for ""fun""; they're also shown abusing/raping women and boys. obviously they've given themselves wholly over to the darkside of their natures. such reprobates are only worthy of one thing: utter annihilation.

several important themes are addressed in the picture besides the main one:

* bitterness/despair and deliverance. the beginning of the film shows rambo in a state of utter bitterness: he's just existing. he has no friends. he doesn't talk much and, when he does, it's few words laced with expletives. the male leader of the missionaries is completely unable to talk him into helping them. two biblical proverbs state ""a gentle answer turns away wrath"" and ""a gentle tongue can break a bone."" the female missionary (julie benz) knows this and skillfully talks john into helping them. yet there's more going on here. this woman with a heart of gold is rambo's ""golden connection"" out of the rut of bitterness. despite his gruff exterior, she sees something in him, something in his eyes – a good heart, even greatness, a genuine glimmer, however faint. is rambo helping the missionaries or is she the one helping him? john instinctively realizes the rope she's throwing him and takes hold of it. there's nothing sensual about their relationship, despite her attractiveness; it's solely spiritual. she stirs in him the hope and faith he's been longing for.

* violence is not always necessary. although this is a very violent film it skillfully shows when pacifism _is_ appropriate. note the incident on rambo's riverboat when the lead mercenary continually insults john and tries to provoke him into a fight. rambo just ignores him, not even saying a word. in other words, he refuses to allow someone to victimize him and draw him into a conflict that has no positive purpose. it takes true strength to do this and rambo has this strength. indeed, john treats the guy as if he's a bothersome gnat. what do you do when a gnat bothers you? do you break out a machine gun or merely ignore it? this is the ""turn the cheek"" principle.

* total pacifism does not work. the new testament does not support the idea of absolute pacifism, but rather limited pacifism (only resorting to violence when justified). for instance, christ’s ministry team had a treasury box with loads of money and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thieves & murderers. also, romans 13 clearly states that the righteous laws of human governments are god-ordained for the purpose of punishing criminals, including the right to execute when appropriate. the vast majority of sane christians realize this, but there are a few extremists who refuse to be balanced with the scriptures on this topic and insist that conflict, and especially armed conflict, is never appropriate. the lead male missionary represents such a person, but perhaps he'll learn the error of his ways. the simple fact is: some people are so degenerate and evil that execution is the only just ultimate reaction (notice i said ""ultimate"").

* rambo’s spiritual rebirth. the first two sequels show rambo searching for truth and flirting with religion and spirituality. in the second film he gets a buddhist necklace off the asian woman he befriends and at the beginning of ""rambo iii"" he is shown living & working at a buddhist temple helping the priests; later, he meets and wins the hearts of moderate islamic villagers and gives his necklace to a muslim boy who helped him. in this movie the female missionary is key to john's positive transformation; at one point she gently asks him whether or not he has any family in the usa. he mumbles that he might have a father, he wasn't sure, and didn't seem to care. shortly later she gives him a cross necklace for helping them (he wouldn't take money). anyway, the end of the film shows rambo walking to his family ranch in southern arizona. obviously john had a positive spiritual metamorphosis in the story that leads to a decade of peace & love before the next film, “last blood” (2019).

""rambo"" was written & directed by stallone and shot in thailand (and arizona). it’s short & sweet at 1 hour, 32 minutes.

wanted is loosely based on the comic book miniseries of the same name by mark millar. it's directed by timur bekmambetov and stars james mcavoy, angelina jolie, morgan freeman, thomas kretschmann, common, terence stamp and konstantin khabensky. the storyline follows wesley gibson (mcavoy), a frustrated and downtrodden office worker who discovers that he is the son of a professional assassin when he is saved by fox (jolie) from being assassinated himself in a supermarket. initially he is baffled and out of his depth, but upon meeting the secret ""fraternity"" headed by sloan (freeman), gibson starts to undergo training to fulfil his destiny as a ""fraternity"" hit-man.

one of the better things about popcorn action movies is when there is a geek coming good and kicking ass. be it super-heroes or average joe's finding something extra, having the rise of the meek get tough at its core is normally a winner. so it is with wanted, the us directorial debut of night/day watch helmer, timur bekmambetov. it's not so much that mcavoy's anxiety riddled office worker gets to play guns, sports cars and hang with a lithe angelina jolie - it's that he, courtesy of a good source, gets to not care about the killing. the film may not be as dark as the source material, but the essence of it is there with corruption and violence at the core. the story, as bonkers as it is, is simplified into one that features ancient weavers receiving messages depicting targets to be wiped from the planet for the greater good of humanity. enter the ""fraternity"" in modern times, which in the name of good, goes out slotting said targets. oh but it's not just a case of line someone up in a telescope and pull the trigger, this is more fun than that.

for action movies in this decade, wanted has few peers. from the intense and brutal training regime that gibson undertakes, to the number of explosive and inventive sequences that flit in and out of the piece, it delivers pulse raising cinema. there's outrageous car pursuits, car jumps with whirls and crash bangs, speeding trains resplendent with stunts, a train crash sequence that's as good as anything in popcorn world, and then there's the bullets. curving bullets that either smack into each other or do untold damage to the forehead of some unknowing target. that the makers are not aiming for the pg-13 market is an obvious bonus, for it allows them to fully payoff on the fights and blood letting. even those that come with funny and inventive gimmicks. bekmambetov is having fun, the nature of the beast is a haven for his fast-cutting and slow-mo dalliances, while the noise that thunders out of the speakers pulls one further into the action.

mcavoy steps up to the action plate with great success, at times charming yet pathetic, at others totally scary, he revels in the chance to carry a movie of such adrenalin fuelled excess. jolie too comes out with much credit, the role of fox giving her the chance to shine, unlike lara croft, as a charismatic action girl. while freeman does what freeman does well, be straight and oddly classy. not since john woo's action berserker face-off 11 years previously has the action genre been this much fun and exciting. the pace may not be perfect, and some scenes will be just too ridiculous for some demanding critics (they of course realise the tongue in cheek/nudge in the ribs that's going on?), but regardless, wanted has taken the action genre to another level. lets hope it's not 11 years till we have to wait for the next bar raiser. 9/10",high

1651,"not the same mummy twice, nor thrice for that matter.

well it's been pretty much universally panned has this third brendan fraser led instalment of the new age mummy series. so lets not beat around the bush here, it's not very good, but it's hardly deserving of the 1/10 ratings it has been given by amateur on line reviewers.

the plot (for what it's worth) sees young alex o'connell, now amazingly a grown man in a short space of time, unearth evil old chinese emperor han and his accursed terracotta army. naturally some bonehead is going to bring him back from the dead, and naturally the now retired o'connell's are forced back into their mummy fighting ways. can rick, evelyn and poor jonathan save the day? will alex prove his credentials as the offspring of such daring-do parents? will anybody care come the finale? 

rachael weisz has (wisely) bailed and into her shoes comes a woeful maria bello, with fluctuating accents and zero chemistry with her leading man, bello has undone the promise shown in world trade center & a history of violence. steer clear of action movies dear. fraser looks bored and can barely muster the energy to deliver the now tired and stilted lines. he admitted once that the mummy 2 was basically a cheeky remake of the first film, quite what he has to say about this one i await with much interest. john hannah is merely a bystander and it's probably the easiest money he will ever earn, an utter waste it be. luke ford does ok as alex and michelle yeoh, jet li (the emperor) & the beautiful isabella leong make do with what the unimaginative script gives them to do.

what saves the film from being a bottom of the barrel feeder is the action quota. even though the spectre of poor cgi hangs around every corner, the sequences come thick and fast and they at least keep the blood pumping, thus stopping the audience themselves from drifting into a centuries long sleep. there's some good gags too (you will yearn for more of liam cunningham), while the choreography for the fights involving the asian stars is not to be sniffed at. stephen sommers left the directors chair for this one, handing over to rob cohen, which explains why the film is more concerned with action accelerate over substance. but sommers, who gave us a genuine genre delight with the first film, has a writing credit and was on production duties for this effort. i trust he now feels saddened by what his franchise has now become. 4/10",low
1653,"the first thing that went through my head the second sunshine cleaning ended, was 'i could have gone on watching for at least another hour'. not just because it ended a little abruptly, but mostly because i so thoroughly enjoyed this film, that i was seriously disappointed when it was over. it's like that book that's so compelling that you just want to inhale every word, but dread to actually finish.

sunshine cleaning is about two sisters, who, driven by dire financial straits, decide to start ""a biohazard removal/crime scene clean-up service"", cleaning up the houses of people who died gruesome deaths. the premise is fairly simple, but executed in a very lovely, heart-warming way, half tragedy – half comedy. because of course, this film is not only about cleaning up other people's mess, but also about cleaning up some of their own baggage along the way, especially when the sisters are confronted with the memory of a death akin to what is now their daily business. somewhere in between all this they have to deal with their eccentric father, the elder sister's peculiar son, love, loss, failure and a glimmer of hope. reading this back now i realise this actually sounds really cheesy and sentimental, but i would have hated it if it was. trust me.

amy adams plays rose, the eldest of the two, and emily blunt plays norah, the rebellious younger sister. rarely have i seen such great chemistry and energy between a leading pair. these two women make it seem like they've been working together for years, and physically they're a perfect match too, they actually look they could be sisters. rose is obviously the mature, sensible one, whereas norah just kind of takes things as they come, not worrying and not taking responsibility for her life. though they seem to be bound not so much by kinship, but rather by a mutual fate and childhood hardship that has left its mark on both of them, although they deal with it very differently. rose tries desperately to build a better life for herself and her son, but rarely finds any luck on her path. norah just wings it and refuses to grow up.

both amy adams and emily blunt prove to have great star quality and talent, and i think i can now officially call myself a fan of both. they are raw and real, one is sweet and the other is sour, without overacting anything. alan arkin is great as their dad. eccentric, bitter yet loving, idealistic and seemingly in a mild state of denial. he plays pretty much the same character as in that other (great!) film of sunshine cleaning's producers, little miss sunshine, where he also played the grumpy granddad. this type of role seems to be custom-made for him. another great part is played by professional chameleon clifton collins, jr. he plays winston, the owner of a cleaning supplies shop, and he turns out to be that small shimmer of good luck that rose so desperately needs. actually, everyone in this film is so perfectly cast that it almost seems like this is a real family, in a real situation. it just doesn't feel contrived in any way, despite the lack of originality and obvious pitfalls where the story could have easily crashed and burned into a wasteland of melodrama and false sentiment. but like i mentioned earlier, this doesn't happen at any point. usually when a film is on the borderline of becoming a total cliché, and yet works out successfully, it is because of one or maybe two factors. however, with sunshine cleaning, it's all of them. cast, screenplay, dialogue, direction, camera work, production, just everything is wonderful. i'm actually running out of superlatives to describe this film.

i'm inclined to give this film 10 stars, however there is just one small thing that kind of failed in my opinion and that's the ending. nothing wrong with it story-wise, it just ended so abruptly that it feels like they literally ran out of tape. it actually kind of threw me off. but... oh, what the heck, this film deserves 10 stars, easily.

in conclusion, sunshine cleaning is just a beautifully crafted story about falling (hard) and getting back up on your feet again. it has a real indie-feel to it, it's basically just a pretty little art house gem. funny thing – while i'm writing this, 4 non blondes' ""what's up"" is playing in the background, and it feels strangely appropriate to the feeling of this film. so if you want to know what to expect of sunshine cleaning, listen to that song, it really captures the essence of the story. 

i can't think of much more to say to sell this film, all i can do is strongly recommend sunshine cleaning to pretty much anyone and everyone. it's wonderful.

1658,"nothing new and only proving that the horror genre in 2008 wasin need of reinvigoration.  

jennifer marsh is a secret service agent, her speciality is crime across the internet. one day she comes across a site that is untraceable, the host of the site conducts painful killings to entertain the watching public. the kicker being that the more people who log on and observe, the quicker the death will be, and, well people being people...

there really isn't much to recommend here, outside of a solid performance from diane lane as marsh, and some newer ingenious deaths to woo the gorno crowd, it's a buy the numbers horror thriller that seems to come along every three months. the villain is incredibly weak, the script is tepid and uninspiring, and the ending is as predictable as anything that has been done badly before. the premise promised so much as well, we are all here in an internet driven age, so what a perfect chance the makers had to play on users fears, sadly this fails in the same way that 2006s stay alive failed, thinking the premise alone will make a great genre piece.

if you liked hostel 12 and saw 37, chances are you will get something from this film, but the original saw, cube and my little eye seem a million miles away now, for at least they had originality and vitality in their favour, untraceable just comes across as a big league cash cow milking the purses of gorno children who fail to see the blunt hammer hitting them over the head. 3/10 for diane only.",low

1668,"knee-deep in the throes of my first love, i was quite surprised to hear that my lady's favourite movie was 'joe versus the volcano'. (i still haven't seen the film). it dawned on me, when i wanted to check out an american film which, to my knowledge, had a plethora of fine acting, that this was written and directed by the same guy who made that film much earlier. being raised christian and hearing in the press over the past few years about misdeeds, especially involving leaders of the catholic church (represented in films as diverse as 'the boys of st. vincent' (john n. smith, 1992) and 'in bruges' (martin mcdonagh, 2008), i was especially intrigued by this, his work of more recent vintage.

the ambiguity at the core of the film (and hence the 'doubt') really acts in the movie's favour. the script and direction are both tense and flawless, and the beautiful new york locations chosen to illustrate the bronx in 1964 help air the play out, and give it more cinematic scope. it features some of the finest work i have seen from philip seymour hoffman (though my favourites will always be 'happiness' and 'the master'), meryl streep (my most-esteemed works of hers are 'the deer hunter' and 'the devil wears prada') and amy adams (this is her finest performance imho) as well as a breakthrough role for viola davis, who steals every scene she's in. this easily holds up well even with shanley's oscar-winning screenplay for 'moonstruck', and, though dark and depressing, is thoroughly recommended for those who can stomach its subject matter, and peer into that abyss without flinching, as these fine exemplars of 21st-century american cinema so easily do here.

1681,"can you change your life for love? what’s the border between craziness and frustration? are we really living our lives? this fantastic movie won 20 awards and 73 nominations. it’s an incredible story and let’s discover why.

the movie is set in connecticut during the mid-1950 and inspired by the book “revolutionary road” written by richard yates. it’s a story of love, marriages, families and abortion, ambitions and frustrations, of dreamers and conformists. it’s the daily tale of all of us, on the road of our lives. looking for an often unachievable and unknown happiness.
 
you will ask yourself “what’s the purpose of this life”? it is just about having a good job, a great house, a wife, children? or there is something more? like the love for yourself, for your talents, your passions, your desires and dreams. but to find the right answer requires painful choices to be made, and this where this masterpiece guide us.

frank and april wheeler are the protagonists and to give them voice and action, we have two of the most talented and incredible actors in hollywood: leonardo di caprio and kate winslet, directed by sam mendes, in one of his most successful films. it’s not a movie for everyone. it’s very sophisticated, well-crafted, a masterpiece, in my opinion.

set in a distant dystopian future where organisms failures are a sure thing, a company named gencon swoops in on society and sets up payment plans for people to afford these organ replacements but if payments stopped they sent the “repo-man” after you. starring anthony head, sarah brightman, bill mosely, paul sorvino, and paris hilton... whose only role as far as i’m concerned that i remember was getting her head cut off in house of wax he he... 
we have a mother who dies at birth from a poison switched from a possible cure by the gencon dude.  but the father thinks it was his fault. plus him being the repo man and gencon’s little torture slave he must keep this secret from his little shiloh.

1698,"martyrs: greek for witness.

martyrs is written and directed by pascal laugier. it stars morjana alaoui and mylene jampanoi.

the new french extremity movement had its bar raised considerably by pascal laugier’s brutal but thought provoking horror. it’s a film as uncompromising as it is confrontational, a picture guaranteed to get a response for better or worse. once viewed it simply will not be forgotten, the images, the twisty narrative thematics and the bloodshed that flows consistently throughout the story, laugier and his two brilliant lead actresses assault the senses, magnificently so.

story is unfurled as a three tiered structure, each one devastating, but it’s with the final third where the picture goes up through the stratosphere, stopping briefly at the café weird just to further tickle our craniums. some of the violence here is tough to watch, and it’s no surprise to find it was met with the inevitable charges of misogyny. yet the culmination of it all puts some perspective on the violence witnessed, leading to a strangely profound and moving climax.

the less you know about it going in for the first time the better. a strong stomach is required, as is an open mind, if you have these things then awaiting you is a visceral masterwork, one of the finest horror film’s to have ever come out of france. yes, it’s that astonishing. 10/10",high

1711,"i think catherine holt (erin bethea) sums up very well what’s wrong with her marriage to caleb (kirk cameron): “you can’t expect me to work every day and get the groceries while you look at trash on the internet dreaming about your boat.” 

she has a point, or rather two. according to her, caleb “tuck[s] away a third of [his] salary saving for a boat we don’t need. [he has] $24,000 in savings when things in our house need fixing."" 

you can’t argue with that; having a boat is after all a single guy kind of thing to do. i don’t need to tell the movie this – what with it being a ""faith-based” drama –, but “no man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. ye cannot serve god and mammon.” in other words, ye cannot have a wife and a boat.

as for the “trash” that caleb is so fond of – i.e., porn –, i could see a way to work that into a marriage, but then both parties would have to be on board, and that’s precisely the problem with this movie. 

to help him save his marriage, caleb’s father john (harris malcom) presents him with “the love dare;” a 40-day program that goes something like this: “day one: … for the next day resolve to say nothing negative to your spouse at all. if the temptation arises, choose not to say anything … day two: … in addition to saying nothing negative to your spouse today, do at least one unexpected gesture as an act of kindness,” and so on and so forth (on the 16th day he has to pray for her; in the movie’s funniest line, caleb confesses “i kind of skipped that one.” this obviously happens before he relents and accepts jesus christ into his heart). 

catherine takes her husband’s newfound attentiveness with a grain of salt (her friends advise her that “he’s trying to butter you up for a divorce,” whatever that means). 

caleb calls his father and complains that “none of this means anything to her,” and he’s right, but how could it be any other way? how can something she doesn’t even know is going on mean anything to her? 

oddly, when john talks about his experience with the love dare, he speaks in plural – e.g., “there was a point when we had no hope either” –; unless he’s using the royal ‘we,’ he means himself and caleb’s mother. caleb, on the other hand, hides the whole thing from catherine, which a) doesn’t seem like the best way to go about repairing your marriage and b) wouldn’t it work better if it were a two-sided effort? it’s not like she’s completely blameless, either. 

and now to give the devil, or i guess jesus, his due. caleb is a firefighter, and he and his crew are called to the scene of a traffic accident. a woman is trapped inside the wrecked vehicle, which in turn is sitting on some tracks right on the path of an oncoming train. they are “currently unable to make contact with the train dispatcher,” so caleb & co. have no choice but to manfully push the car out of harm’s way.

this is all kinds of great. not only does it put to shame many a newer, much more expensive film (is it an actual train? i’m not going to go out on a limb that it is, but if it’s cgi, then it’s the best damn cgi train i’ve ever seen), but it makes me care about the characters because i can believe they truly are firefighters putting their lives on the line – quite literally, in this case.

1715,"a woman, wendy (michelle williams), is trekking through america, well, she does have a car, although not of much use to her (it breaks down early on in the movie). she also has a dog, lucy, whom she loses early in the movie. we have no idea where this woman came from exactly, but we know where she is going, and why. alaska... to get work. of course, this might not be the entire truth, just what she tells people. she is not poor, but she has clearly not been wasting her money so far and she is not about to do that now, although, circumstances might take that decision right out of her hands.

this woman has experienced something, and carry the scars. she does not trust people well, but learns to trust some people throughout the movie. but luckily, the movie does not provide all the answers... we have to figure them out for ourselves. these are the movies that i like the best.

michelle williams is amazing in this role, heartbreaking really. she makes good decisions, but also some terribly wrong ones that might change her journey significantly. i found myself being angry at her early on for making a really stupid and unnecessary decision, but how wonderful to finally see a character who isn't perfect. flaws is what define a human.

the movie itself is slow paced, taking its time to follow wendy around. it never rushes the story for a second, and when it is over, you can't help but think that it could have easily been 2-3 hours longer, as you want to see what happens to wendy and lucy. the images are very realistic, following wendy close. they are not perfect, but neither is life, and this movie wants to show us just that... life. this is clearly an indie movie, and one of the best i've seen in a good while. i've seen another movie by the director, kelly reichardt, and it was filmed in the same way.

_last words... wendy and lucy is a story about being human, about surviving in the world, about searching for something, a purpose maybe. it is also about friendship and trust, about the choices that we make, the choices that come to define us and our lives. yes, it might seem like a small movie, but in reality, it is the biggest story of all, the story of our lives._",high

so, on one hand (and i have been ripping into stone lately) this is a solid oliver stone film. unlike snowden and world trade center, it actually has what you expect from an oliver stone film. and i can't not like that.

agree with stone's politics or not...you go to see an oliver stone film because he can leave his mark on it...and this has that mark.

so you can sit down and watch it and have that clear ""i'm watching an oliver stone movie"" feeling, and that is always enjoyable when you can do that.

but then, it's been a decade since its release and that kind of mutes it. when it came out in 2008, w was still in office and just going to see it made you proud to be an american. hardly any other country would allow someone to release a film critical of the current leader while he was still in office. it gave you a great ""this is what makes america great"" feeling, ""this is what puts us above the rest of the world. thank you oliver stone.""

but, it's been a decade, so you don't get that feeling from watching it now. you don't feel compelled to buy your ticket, and then go back and see it again to celebrate the 1st amendment.

and because of that, a decade later, it kind of makes you feel that it should have been released now instead of then.

a decade later you remember the people that were celebrating in the streets when he was finally out. you remember that sense of relief that not bush was in office. you remember the obama victory...you remember the st. paul horror, and the sense that the dnc could have run a rotting corpse and won.

and then, after you remember all of that, you get the feeling that it would have made a better ending if stone just waited a year to make the film.

but despite all of that, it was a fair film. it was balanced (unlike this review) and that's probably because of what my late father used to say, he hated w. as a president, but felt he'd like him as a person. which, unfortunately, is an attitude you're regrettably not allowed to have today.

but that doesn't change the fact that you still feel like you are watching an oliver stone movie. it doesn't change the feeling of pride you got by going to see w. in the theaters when it was released. it doesn't change the fact that it is still a good movie...even if it's a better movie for the people that are old enough to remember it.",high

the message throughout watchman and tales of the black freighter in film and more importantly in graphic novel form is that we as humans try so hard to make the world a better place, but being pushed so far while trying to rid the world of evil we become the very thing we're fighting against, sometimes this a fact we do not see, or we do when it's too late. when alan moore wrote the story for the graphic novel, he did so at the height of this planet's greatest threat of nuclear annihilation; the cold war, the u.s. and russia at a stalemate over nuclear arms, and russia's invasion of afghanistan, had meant that at any moment millions of people on this planet could have met a brutal end.

as far as the story goes, this is a concept that has been warped, and manipulated into a alternate universe where in 1985 richard nixon has changed the constitution of the usa and made it allowable for him to serve more than 2 terms of presidency, it's also a universe where in the times after wwii ordinary citizens decided that crime and corruption throughout america, and especially new york had gotten to levels beyond the control of authorities that they would suit up as masked vigilantes, and fight crime head on. by 1985 masked heroes are outlawed, and former ""heroes"" were forced to reveal themselves, or stay hidden, but give up their lifestyle.

the story of the most part is told through the eyes of one character rorschach (haley) as he investigates the murder of a fellow vigilante, the comedian (morgan). rorschach is the only vigilante who has not given up the lifestyle, and is wanted by the f.b.i. rorschach tries to re-engage the remaining ""heroes"" to help him find the murderer, and get to the heart of why he was murdered. the other ""heroes"" are night owl ii (wilson); an aging recluse who inherited a fortune from his father and used it to engage in vigilante activities, silk spectre ii (ackerman); daughter of an original minutewoman (cugino), ozymandias (goode), a self made millionaire who has modeled himself and his life on alexander the great, and dr. manhattan (crudup), the only real superhero due an accident in a atomic chamber in a lab when he was a physicist.

the film follows pretty closely the themes and tone of the book, much more than any comic related movie before it, thanks mostly to the dedication of director zack snyder. the look and feel of the film to date it in 1985 was very well handled, and can certainly be called a period piece due to the level of exact detail through-out. performances are in general pretty well done, and reflect the emotions of the characters in the book, as this is the ultimate cut, the extended scenes, plus the interwoven story of the comic book within a comic book; ""tales of the black freighter"" make for a film that is worthy of its 215 minute length. having said that they leave well and truly enough of the story in the theatrical cut where the message still shines through.

the credits for this film are the best i have ever seen, using the bob dylan song ""the times they are a-changing"", and features snapshots of the highs and lows of the minutemen and watchmen from the 1940's through to the 1980's against the backdrop of important cultural and political icons and events.

this movie is easily one of my favourites of the modern age of film, because of the well delivered message, and the uncompromised approach to bring the graphic novel to life.",high
1738,"_**the ""apocalypse now"" of superhero films**_

based on alan moore's graphic novel, 2009's ""watchmen"" takes place in an alternative 1985 where nixon is serving his fifth term and costumed vigilantism is illegal. a former masked crimefighter named the comedian is murdered, prompting his previous teammates to investigate the crime. things get complicated as the backstories of most of the watchmen are revealed and worldwide nuclear war looms.

for some reason i was never interested in the watchmen and therefore never read the graphic novel, even though i had the opportunity. why? the fact that it took place in an alternative reality turned me off, as did the peculiarities of the team members which, i later discovered, moore intended as satire. that said, this is mind-blowing. ""watchmen"" is an adult-oriented superhero flick with a convoluted plot, strong characters and total originality. the latter two score high marks with me any day.

rorschach (jackie earle haley) stands out with his gravelly voice and right-wing ideology, although he's not very likable. he's impressive yet, at the same time, kind of pathetic. the character was based on steve ditko's the question.

the comedian (jeffrey dean morgan) exudes great charisma and is reminiscent of the punisher, if he were a jokester. unfortunately, the comedian's arrogant & hotheaded and has a weakness towards the ladies, not to mention cold-blooded murder.

night owl (patrick wilson) is another strong character, obviously based on batman or blue beetle. unlike the previous two he's very likable. i always thought his costume looked really lame in the graphic novel but, as depicted in the film, it kicks axx.

dr. manhattan (greg plitt), named for the manhattan project and based on captain atom with a dash of mr. fantastic, is an almost god-like being who can do pretty much anything. he's so detached from the human experience that he walks around totally nude and has no time for his woman, silk spectre ii. he'd rather hang out on mars -- literally!

silk spectre ii (malin akerman) stands out due to her sexy costume more than anything else, not to mention akerman's drop-dead-gorgeous looks. the character was based on phantom lady and black canary. silk can't handle dr. manhattan's increasing aloofness and consequently diverts to night owl for human warmth.

silk spectre (carla gugino) is silk spectre ii's mother and has a pretty significant part. like her daughter, she's hot, albeit in a whole different way.

ozzyosbourne, whoops, i mean ozymandias (matthew goode) is the least developed character and loosely based on charlton comic's thunderbolt. he's ultra-smart, ultra-quick and kinda foppish.

another highlight is the hypnotic score by tyler bates mixed with a quality soundtrack (e.g. ""the sound of silence,"" ""all along the watchtower,"" etc.)

bottom line: the film is long, dark, mature, dialogue-driven and convoluted, but the strong characters and originality win the day. no moronic ""blockbuster"" trash here. not to mention silk spectre ii and her mother are extremely easy on the eyes. as far as superhero flicks go, there's really nothing else like ""watchmen."" it's even more atypical than the x-men and easily one of my favorite superhero flicks, maybe even the favorite. ""watchmen"" is like the ""apocalypse now"" of superhero films!

runtime: theatrical cut: 162 minutes; director's cut: 186 minutes; the ultimate cut: 215 minutes

comparing cuts: i own both the theatrical cut and director's cut. although the theatrical version is just fine, the dc is worthwhile for extended dialogue to existing scenes in the theatrical cut; the biggest addition is an attack on night owl's mentor, hollis mason, at the hands of a thug gang and night owl's subsequent brutal revenge at a bar. despite the convoluted plot, i had no problem following the story in the theatrical cut, even though i've never read the graphic novel. the filmmakers did an excellent job cutting out the fat in the theatrical version. so don't think you'll need to purchase the dc to understand the story; it's not necessary. my recommendation is to check out the theatrical version first and only purchase the dc if the theatrical cut left you wanting even more, which is what it did for me. even so, i prefer the theatrical cut; it's leaner and just all-around better.

<em>'fantastic mr. fox'</em> is a terrific stop motion animated film, which is unmistakably a piece of wes anderson's work. i enjoyed the whole film undoubtedly, though the first half is much stronger than the second. the opening piece of stop motion didn't actually fill me with confidence, but thankfully that immediately disappeared as the whole thing looks truly excellent.

george clooney is great in this, definitely the most i've liked a performance (from what i've currently seen, of course) of his away from the <em>'ocean's</em> flicks. every member of the cast is top notch to be fair, from bill murray to michael gambon to eric anderson. willem dafoe is fun too.",high

bale really stinks it up, but then again, it's an mcg film and he really doesn't know how to handle things. he splices it together, scene by scene, with no uniformity or any real transitions to lead the viewer through the story, and does so with a convoluted plot that does, kind of, make a little bit of sense... kind of.

1778,"'friday the 13th' turned out to be one of the biggest disappointments when it comes to horror classics remakes. after watching the trailers, i got the wrong idea that this film was going to be more serious. the previews gave me the false impression that this remake was going to go deeper into jason's background story or maybe even offer extremely gory murders, when in reality, it is exactly the opposite. i'm not one of those horror lovers who want to know everything related to the villains, their origins and such, but in this case, it would have been acceptable to throw in some flashbacks regarding jason voorhees' past. unfortunately, this remake wastes all the opportunities to make this interesting and instead, it offers an exaggerated and ineffective amount of comedy situations that are badly placed and ruin the possibility of creating a genuine horror feeling. comedy situations in slasher films are no surprise, but in this remake, the attempted comedy is badly placed and seems like it was forced by the producers to make the film more marketable. i will give an example: after a really tense and dramatic persecution, the film cuts to a scene involving a horny stereotyped hillbilly lusting over a mannequin, while jason silently walking up to him from behind, with the obvious intention of slashing him. how can they mix cheap humor and tension in one scene? the results obviously cannot be good. it was a murder scene, but instead of causing uneasiness, tension or shock, everyone at the movie theater was laughing at the guy talking about how he lost his virginity to a mannequin. the worst part is that the so-called humor is extremely 15-years-ago and even back then, it wouldn't have been funny.

the gore is very unsatisfying also. nowadays, slasher films usually offer creative and really brutal murders and even if the plot is not so good, you can always at least settle for that. when i found out that marcus nispel was directing this, i thought it was good news, because he directed ""the texas chain saw massacre"" remake, which is a fine example of a movie that may not be as good as the original, but at least it offers something more serious, gory and overall fulfilling. naturally, since marcus nispel also directed 'friday the 13th' remake, i expected something in the same vein as 'the texas chainsaw massacre' remake. sadly, that was a very inaccurate assumption. in this film, the gore is completely unsatisfactory and in some cases, the murders are even funny. the entire movie theater burst into a maniacal laughter during some of the murders and i must say that in those cases, i had to agree with them.

another thing that bothered me about this film, is the fact that they could have showed a little bit more about the character of mrs. voorhees. unfortunately, she only appears during the first seconds of the film and they cut her scenes with the opening credits, which is a disgrace. the confrontation between mrs. voorhees and the counselor girl is perhaps one of the finest points of the entire 'friday the 13th' series, and it should have been remade in an equally tense way. cutting the scene with the opening credits is, in my opinion, a self-sabotage. i think it's safe to say that many fans of the original film were eager to learn some more about jason's beloved mother and see her more time on the screen. but no... apparently, they didn't even take advantage of that opportunity to make this movie more interesting. true, we see a little bit about jason's environment, since the characters get to take a tour inside his house and it was a good idea to show his bedroom and evidence the fact that once upon a time, the killing machine was an innocent boy with a normal life. however, that doesn't make up for the lack of space that mrs. voorhees had on the story.

'friday the 13th' turned out to be a teen comedy with lousy humor and some badly placed murders from the beginning until the end. watch it if you're curious, but unless you're a silly teenager who thinks everything is funny, don't expect anything even remotely good, because you'll be devastated.",low

if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie - because it underscores all the clichés you're promised in a good 2 hours. on a positive note, it has become a fast paced piece of work. but i got about as excited by the production as i did watching campfire tv at night.",low

1792,"a franchise re-energised-big time! 
 
it's not an understatement to say that the news of a new star trek movie was met in equal measure by suspicion and pretty low expectations. step forward j.j. abrams to direct it, and many wondered while the guy behind tv series ""lost"" and ""mission impossible iii"" would want to dabble on hallowed sci-fi turf?. things were further eyebrow raising when abrams openly admitted to not having been a fan of the original show so cherished by a legion of trekkies. then news came of the film being a prequel, based around the starfleet academy and the coming together of what we know as the u.s.s. enterprise crew. ""ooh that will be a tough one to carry off"" said many, ""kirk & spock as young spunkers - surely not"" they said. well not only did abrams pull it off as it were, he simultaneously appeased most trekkies whilst garnering a whole new generation of sci-fi observers. budgeted at $140,000,000, abrams star trek went on to gross worldwide $384,953,778. figures that, even allowing for the huge fan-base that the franchise has, show that many first timers not only went to see it - but also that they enjoyed it so much they went back for second helpings. i know i did.

the success of the film isn't hard to fathom, because although abrams upped the action quota (with a number of breath taking and eye appealing sequences) he also dispensed with much of the sci-fi psycho babble that has blighted some of the previous filmic instalments in this most up and down of franchise's. sure there's stuff in there for the discerning fan, with a time travelling revenge plot at its axis, how could there not be?, but abrams and his writers (roberto orci /alex kurtzman) keep it simple, savvy and sexy. they smartly link to trek lore with a crucial plot and character development featuring the kobayashi maru, while pain, emotional conflict and personal crisis all feature heavily. this is, one can ""logically"" say, a spiky post 9/11 trek movie. there's even room for a romantic strand, a strand that is tender and fits the whole make-up of the piece perfectly. all of which only works because the cast are, in the main, producing great work.

getting leonard nimoy to appear in a small, but crucial role, is nothing short of being a master-stroke. his presence keeps the all important essence of star trek within what is ultimately a reboot. it's like a father figure watching over proceedings, making not only the cast feel safe, but also us the viewers. the youngsters in the cast are impressive, chris pine (kirk), zachary quinto (spock) and zoe saldaña (uhura) lead from the fresh faced front. while karl urban (bones mccoy) and simon pegg (scotty) impact with comic relief that aids instead of hinders the plot developments. villain duties falls to eric bana as romulan captain nero, he's a touch miffed is nero, and bana brings the character's vengeful pain vividly to life. while bruce greenwood as captain christopher pike adds a touch of class that he almost always seems to do.

this u.s.s. enterprise has launched itself in another direction, and yes, it's boldly going where no-one has boldly gone before. it is, all told, a bona fide blockbuster with brains and balls. the like of which has sadly been missing from many a modern era summer release. yes it's not all perfect, the odd scene could quite easily have been jettisoned, and some accents need a bit of fine tuning, but they are very minor complaints. a triumph from abrams and his team - note the stardate in the ships log, for this is a noteworthy moment in modern sci-fi cinema. now comes perhaps a bigger challenge, the notoriously difficult second film...  10/10",high
1795,"bright star is the rare biopic of an artist that actually provides some insight into its subject’s craft. usually, a film about a writer, including such recent examples as to olivia (roald dahl) and the laureate (robert graves), will approach the creative process as 99-percent inspiration and 1-percent actual work – and sometimes not even that. writing is taken as matter of course; poems come out straight out of the author’s mouth, fully formed like athena emerging from zeus’s forehead.

bright star doesn’t dismiss the notion of divine inspiration, but it does not tacitly take it for granted either; on the contrary, it acknowledges and articulates it (“if poetry does not come as naturally as leaves to a tree, then it had better not come at all”). moreover, even though it declares “poetic craft is a carcass, a sham,” it does so perhaps out of modesty (after all, “a poet is not at all poetical. he is the most un-poetical thing in existence. he has no identity”), before diving right into the crux of the craft itself (“a poem needs understanding through the senses. the point of diving in a lake is not immediately to swim to the shore but to be in the lake, to luxuriate in the sensation of water. you do not work the lake out. it is an experience beyond thought. poetry soothes and emboldens the soul to accept mystery”).

this is all great stuff, and writer/director jane campion displays a sincere love for poetry with which she infuses her characters (who not only commit their favorite poems to memory, but can even recite verbatim from literary reviews). the problem is that her cast themselves are un-poetical and have no identity, and while this might serve them well in their poetic endeavors, as characters it renders them dull and unappealing; ben wishaw is wishy-washy as john keats, and although credit is due campion for not depicting him as a proto-rockstar (unlike, for instance, leo dicaprio’s rimbaud in total eclipse), she loses many points for portraying keats’s romantic interest fanny brawne (abbie cornish) as a proto-groupie (early on, in order to impress him, she quotes some of keats’s verses back to him, as if he weren’t familiar enough with his own work).

i’m aware that an artist’s love life, or lack thereof, tends to inform his creative output, but the romance between wishaw and cornish is so corny and mushy that we can’t believe such saccharine sentiment could ever translate into keats’s sublime lyricism. only paul schneider as the sardonic charles armitage brown, keats’s fellow poet, comes across as a sensible person who can tell the difference between poetry and real life; he starts out as boorish for the sake of boorishness, but he grows on us the more we realize that his contempt for the shallow fanny is well-deserved (i especially enjoyed when he tricks her with a question about paradise lost’s non-existent rhymes).",low

it wouldn't be so bad if he wasn't the lead character.  the movie is about their business, and robin's character's kids, but personality wise robin has to play this push over character that can't do anything but take the punches, and he doesn't do abuse humor well.  he's known for absurd humor, that the situation is ridiculous and out of control, not that he's suffering from it persay.

i've also always like robin william's connection to kids and that, at heart, he's a family guy.  this character that lives isolated from his kids, that can't be fun was a poor casting for him.

honestly, looking at the story even, i don't know why anyone decided to make this, unless the right names made it happen, and they just left big blank spaces in the script that said, ""something ridiculous and funny"" and they just slotted in things like ""seth green gets adopted by a guerilla"".

it's hard to understand weird people. oh, actually, i'm weird. it's hard to understand normal people. i've been depressed for a great deal of time. not depressed like: ”oh, i'm not feeling okay now. but everything is okay”. it's something like: “i'm feeling very bad, and sad; probably i'm considered as i am freak. but i consider others as being freaks. i'm not depressed because of weirdness – it's because of life, as it is”. uncertainly, i'm both mary and max.

the first – my state of mind.
unbearable pressure in head, which i almost can't put literally vertical on my head. it's pretty hard, considering it's mass. i feel like an invisible ghost pushes my head and makes my eyes falling down. teeth and jaw are stiff. i'm going to sleep. it's the most comfortable way to make reality become unreal and relaxing. i'm crying when the story of the sense of life is being said. i'm smiling when there are people around me. it's a spontaneous reaction. probably because i'm max in my mind, mary in my soul.

people probably wrongly understand depression; or more precisely – they have no idea how actually it functions for real, in mind of attached person. they think they are mad, or they're pretending something wrong is happening- “depression is nothing serious”.

i'm mary:
i'm ready to finish my living, to kill myself, to die in the full coldness of the life. there is no good person in the world, there is no sense of
life, there is no hapinnes in the world, there is nothing funny to do. but i won't do this. medicines are really useful. they're changing our brain. i want to be in a closed room, i don't want to eat, i hardly ever sleep, but i'm tired. my willing is just to make me being physically smaller, to become a dot in a nowhere and to forget about everything. i have headaches. i almost haven't eaten anything for a couple a days, i'm sad, unsuccessful, bad in every possible way. there is no meaningless of living. we've been born. we're going to dye. we're nothing. i'm isolated, obsessed with horrible thoughts, (horrible from my point of view). these thoughts are as normal as they could be. i'm right but
nobody understands me. acting happiness and smiling and funny person makes me feeling even worse after a while. the first thing i'm going to do is to push walls around me, to make me feel pain, to be alone and to do nothing – because, there is nothing to do. the only one friend i believed in disappointed me. nobody cares. the next state is that i would try to be “normal”. i'm buying stupid cosmetics instead of going to travel. i'm talking to people, doing this as they do. pretending being cool and perfect. funny. communicative. everything went bad because it's not me. go ahead!

now, i'm max:
einstein said there were only two infinite things: cosmos and one's stupidity. i agree with him. i am different, i'm maybe even smart, i'm trying to understand the world. maybe others are, too. different, and also triers. i like chocolate, i don't have friends, there is no justice in the world. anxiety and changing mood are no so simple things. feeling are unpredictable, emotions are strong. emotions are strong but undefined. i gave up. my psychiatrist is giving me instructions how to act in real life. “this is good, this is bad, in this situation you have to cry, in this to laugh, in this to imitate some nerd.” i was even using small notebook where i wrote “acting explanations”. i met mary, but who cares. i'm used to living on my own. there is no friend. i am distanced form everyday life, like there is invisible barrier between me and others. it makes me being special; but obviously not in a good way.

we're now good friends. she is the best one for me; but also the only one. oh, there are more freaks here. haha. impossible. she understands my needs, my mind, my reactions, my way of viewing stuff.

the second – don't worry. robots are walking down the streets. everyone is the same as the others. they define themselves as normal guys. just define, don't worry. you can define them as you want the left person is copy of the right one. everyone is the same. everyone
has striped hair, blue narrow jeans, the equal brains, the equal opinion.
it's easier acting like they are acting. just go down the street, listen to the others, turn off your mind, point of view the world and your charm. just be like others. be stupid. be robot. i'm starting to believe einstein. this is not myth he's very smart. but also you need to be good. brave, beautiful, funny, intelligent, popular,...(just kidding) ;)

be who you are, and help humanity. and believe there are also people worth respecting, because they are not robots. you just have to find them. also they'll find you. they exist. look bright, go straight. we're here and we can't run out of it. imagine our life is one adventure we are lucky to have chance to play in. you're not a weirdo. just go on, enjoy the adventure, be yourself, even when you have to be pathetic as i am now. :) after that, sense of life will come to you; you don't have to search so much! just relax ;)

let the game begin!

i'm not a fan of dogs... in fact, i'm one of those people who never had dogs, and that's why i didn't develop a great admiration for these animals, despite recognizing that they are excellent companions and can make a difference for many people, in different situations (for example, as part of police units or as guides for the blind). but the truth is that i feel every day how uncomfortable dogs can be, if they fall into the hands of careless owners, or those who do not teach them properly: they howl when alone, they make a lot of noise when other animals pass by, they run to sniff and lick other people without their owners paying attention if they want to have contact with their animals and, worse, they defecate anywhere without their owners taking care to collect the droppings. yes, the education of dog owners in portugal is non-existent in most cases. the fault, of course, lies entirely with the imbecile human owners, but it helped me not to harbor sympathy for these animals. the fair, in these things, always pays for the sinner.

however, even the human being with less affinity for dogs will recognize the value and the moving beauty of this film, loosely based on a true story that took place in japan, before the second world war, and which has already given rise to at least one japanese film, in 1987. what this film does is to take this japanese story and transport it to the united states, telling it as if it had taken place on us soil, but keeping a lot of elements, implicit and discreet, that link us to japanese culture (the dog breed, the dog's name, even the martial arts). i have nothing against remakes and i have to admit that hachiko's true story deserved a movie... but the truth is that there are a number of similar reports around the world attesting to the loyalty and unparalleled attachment of various animals to their owners. so, if the idea was just to take hachiko to the us, maybe it would have been better if the script had created a new and entirely fictional story, albeit inspired by the real hachiko (and other dogs).

having made all these considerations, i believe that we owe a tribute to richard geere for another exceptionally well done and very palatable work, in which the actor manages to monopolize our attention in a friendly character, that touches our emotional side. however, and if we exclude the three dogs that participated in this film and played the role of the protagonist, there is virtually nothing more to say about the cast! the remaining actors only say what they are told to say, without adding anything truly positive, nor receiving interesting and developed material for their respective characters. this includes joan allen, who appears to have dropped in this movie by parachute.

on a technical level, there are several positive aspects to be highlighted, such as the pleasant cinematography, the good choice of filming locations and the intelligent use of the sets and some visual and sound effects. it's not a flashy movie, but it does everything it can to touch our hearts and can even feel corny and sentimental, especially towards the end. i handled it very well, but of course not all people will like it. the choice of animals for this movie was really good, and they are just cute and adorable in the extreme. and we can't forget about that incredible soundtrack, based on sweet piano melodies. it all helps this movie to be exceptionally sweet and suitable for family evenings. however, i leave a note for parents: if you don't want your children to ask you, in an insistent way, to adopt a puppy, don't let them see this movie.",high

running man with a dash of facebook, and not much more. maybe more the book running man, less the schwarzenegger thing. but essentially, it's that story - bits of which have been filmed numerous times.

the logistics and the logic in this story don't add up. unclear rules and chaotic action scenes permanently maxed-out on violence make it impossible to either feel the danger, or compassion with the protagonists during the battles. 
and outside the battles, there is not much suspense either, nor acting possibilites, nor dialogue, let alone character development. even the technobabble is off.

oh, and the cgi at start is sub-par, even for its day. (hint: if you can't afford to do it with good cgi, use physical effects instead.)

this is all about the ""art world"", which means it's not about art, the quality / value of at all: it's all about capitalism, so it becomes an business / politics movie.  it's all about these people we don't know or care about diddling each other and trying to out extort each other.

1866,"great watch, will watch again, and highly recommended.

this has a wonderfully exciting premise: alien refugees on terra, how terrans react and how the aliens react.  the premise, as delivered, has some odd holes in though: it's specified that all of the crew have died, mysteriously, and no one knows how to operate the ship, but it's been in the air for some time.  the idea of gravity alone should have motivated johannesburg to evacuate, but their government interaction seems decidedly weak.

the advantage of setting the story in south africa, for an american audience, is that it's a very capitalistic society where they speak chiefly english: it's very similar to being set in mexico and using mexican cartels instead of nigerian gangs.

so if we accept that we haven't been able to extract an incident report, that we're not able to move the ship, and none of the xenos can move the ship, then the premise includes that one xenos knows what to do.  one would think that he just talks to someone and he gets all his people off planet, but since he's smart enough to do what he's been doing for 20 years, then he knows not to trust anyone.  but this self-serving principle is key to understanding character motivations going forward.

the writing in this is so good, along with the effects, and performance delivery.  as vickis deals with his transformation, it prompts so many philosophical questions of what it is to be a person / human / xenos, a citizen, a government agent.  it also sort of resembles a gangsta / heist movie at parts, as opposed to a anti-government escapee.

if any of the deep stuff worried you, then be at ease that this movie has plenty of explosions, gunfire and sci-fi goodness.  it's also filled with some silly cliches that serve the points of the story, but there are several points in this movie that i have to shake my head at.  the motivations don't make sense unless you're reminded that everyone, including the protagonists, are (forced) in a self-serving mindset and it's about what they can do for themselves, even when working together with the contrast being, of course, that only when anyone is cooperating that anyone gets anywhere.

you can just imagine the suits sitting around their big round table discussing how to churn out another financially beneficial final destination movie and get away with it. big suit number one puts forward that they obviously need more inventive mouse trap like deaths. big suit number two has the genius notion that 3d is again taking off so why not utilise that option too. and that's pretty much all that it took, with the end result being a movie that is very self aware of its roots, but still plays out as the runt of the final destination litter.

just as the director of the first one, james wong, was brought back to direct part 3, the makers here bring back the director of part 2, david r. ellis, to direct part 4! which ultimately proves to be nothing more than some sort of nepotism like factor because the final destination is basically just over 82 minutes of poor acting, bad writing and a series of kills weaved together by the odd 5 minutes of barely relevant characterisations (the exposition as painful as the gory deaths!). 

the kills entertain as they pretty much always have throughout the franchise, with the opening disaster sequences (here set at a speedway stadium) continuing one of the series' great traditions. while the opening and closing x-ray/skeletal credit sequences are superb and a credit to those involved. yet it all feels so tired, where in spite of the willingness to upgrade the technology, it's still lazy and has nothing to really justify its very being other than that to make easy money.

the story, as written, is actually pretty goo, but there are certain comedic points that only sabotage the movie.  the biggest problems are simply that the lead actor just is not charismatic enough for the role:  the character can still be a wimp and likeable enough for the audience to be behind him from the start.  the second problem, which probably hurts the lead, is that the ""best friend"" character has too big a personality and is gratuitously stupid far beyond the point of irritation.  there are several points where the movie stops just so we can watch him be a moron.

it's all about pacing.  the movie wants to shock and awe, but doesn't build to anything, it just randomly flings things at the wall to see what sticks and then forcing you to look while it asks, ""isn't that crazy?""

1897,"gerty, we're not programmed. we're people, do you understand?

directed by duncan jones and starring sam rockwell, moon finds rockwell as sam bell who is coming to the end of his three year contract on a lunar station working for lunar industries. his only companion is an intelligent computer named gerty (voiced by kevin spacey). when sam has an accident he awakens to find he is now not alone and all he thought and believed in is just not as it seems.

forget any fears about a low budget and any plot similarity to 2001: a space odyssey, for this is a cracker jack of a science fiction picture. film quickly fills us in on sam bell the man and his function up there on the lunar station. his relationship with gerty the computer grabs our interest whilst the production design has a sort of medicinal sheen to it. once sam's solitude is established, the minimal contact with earth explained, the pic then spins into another dimension, dragging both sam and us viewers into the vortex.

to say more would be churlish, but this is adult science fiction, clever in existential whiles and scathing with observations on corporate shenanigans. narratively it's evocative in its telling, even haunting and philosophical, where a brilliant rockwell nails every inch of bell's search for being, and crucially, the truth. it's all building towards a finale of some devilish substance, no cop outs or easy fed answers, just a pertinent question asked of the viewers. moon comes highly recommended to sci-fi fans who are after a bit more than mere sparkly fluff and robotic chaos. 9/10",high

1901,"the only thing that’s beyond a reasonable doubt here is this movie’s stupidity. the film opens with district attorney mark hunter (michael douglas) addressing the jury at a murder trial: “the defense would like to tell you that our entire case is circumstantial. there are no eyewitnesses, no ballistic match, no alibi."" odd. one would think that a prosecutor who has scored 17 murder convictions in a row would view the absence of an alibi as something that favors the prosecution and not the defense.

reporter c.j. nicholas (jesse metcalfe) is convinced that hunter is corrupt; all 17 convictions were decided by dna evidence that 
nicholas is certain was planted in some way by hunter. for example, a cigarette butt photographed at a crime scene belongs to a cigarette the defendant is shown smoking in an interrogation video; nicholas's boss asks him rhetorically, ""how could someone plant the cigarette at the crime scene when the interrogation took place three days after the crime scene photographs were taken?""

undaunted, nicholas concocts a harebrained scheme to frame himself for the murder of a prostitute using circumstantial evidence (we know it’s harebrained because is a life of david gale ripoff). this includes buying a balaclava (and macing it while he’s wearing it. d’oh!) and a pair of sneakers from an ""extremely rare"" brand that ""they stopped making in 1999.""

these shoes leave a footprint that matches in “size and weight” one found at the crime scene. i'd say this is a hint that (spoiler) nicholas is the killer after all (otherwise the ""size and weight"" thing would be a huge coincidence), but that would be giving hyams too much credit — especially considering that nicholas forces a poor jack russell to bite him in the calf of his left leg, to recreate the bite received by the murderer courtesy of a witness's dog; however, since he really is the killer, this means he already has a bite mark. 

the second bite occurs off-camera, which leads me to assume either nicholas managed to get the second dog to bite him in exactly the same place as the first, or that corey (joel david moore), his friend and accomplice (in everything but the murder), who is also supposedly a journalist, is unable to tell the difference between a fresh dog bite and an old one. and let's not even talk about the sneakers of which nicholas actually owns two pairs (so much for «extremely rare»).

the icing on the bullshit cake is that nicholas's plan depends entirely on hunter actually being corrupt and willing to plant evidence, even though it's been well established that this is nothing more than a hunch on nicholas's part, all his evidence of it nothing but pure speculation.",low

the library of alexandria no longer existed during the time of hypatia. furthermore, the circumstances surrounding the destruction or closure of the library of alexandria remain shrouded in mystery. the precise cause, whether through fire or deliberate demolition, eludes us. yet the film decides to come up with its own narrative as to how the library was destroyed. additionally, the depiction of christian riots in the film does not align with historical accuracy, a complete falsehood just to add drama and tension to an otherwise boring feature film.

1924,"**despite swinton's powerful performance, luca guadagnino proved it a mistake to put narrative at the service of technique.**

what is the origin and focal point of cinematographic art? it's a question that seems rhetorical, but which, for me, is fundamental to understanding the problems of this film. why? because for me, the essential point of cinema, what is most important, is to tell a story. this means that aesthetics, style and art must serve the narrative, not the other way around. and what this film does is, precisely, use a narrative for an exercise in aesthetics and style.
 
the script had everything to work, with a dramatic story that, despite not bringing anything new (there are lots of movies about adulteries, mature women dissatisfied with their lives, rich families that work badly, etc.), at least had everything that it needed to entertain us. basically, it's the story of a russian woman who married an italian textile tycoon and had three children. she is not necessarily unhappy, but lives a monotonous existence, at the whim of social and family conveniences, so she ends up finding excitement and pleasure in a torrid affair with a friend of one of her sons. and of course, when all this comes to light, the family's life is shaken.

the film has its value for the narrative and the script, even considering that there is a lot of cliché and predictable melodrama. but director luca guadagnino doesn't seem to give relevance to the story he wants to tell. he is not interested in entertaining us with a film that blends art and entertainment harmoniously. guadagnino just wants to show off and show everything he has learned about cinema, all the technique, the mastery of cinematography, the use of the soundtrack, sound and image. this film is simply a vain exercise in technique and style.

tilda swinton cleverly took the opportunity to, in open collaboration with the director, build for herself a character tailored to what she needs and knows how to do. it was a work that took several years, but it leveraged the project to its happy conclusion. and we have to admit that swinton is wonderful and gives us a deep and powerful interpretation of the main character. unfortunately, she is the only actress who stands out in this film on a positive note. the rest of the cast, mostly italian, is quite average, with empty and disinterested interpretations, and there are really annoying and tiresome characters.

as i said above, it is in the technical aspects that guadagnino really bets, and tries his best to stand out, and we have to admit that he knows how to use cinematography and film work very well. the film makes good use of the filming locations used in milan and elsewhere in italy, and manages to convey the pleasure of eating a good meal. in fact, it even conveys the pleasure of gluttony more easily than the pleasure of sex, because all sex scenes, however intense, are manifestly artificial and exaggerated. the feeling that everything is over the top becomes even more latent due to a very slow pace, which makes us numb, and due to the intrusion of an irritating histrionic soundtrack.",low

the first 20 minutes or so was not too bad. then it just went to hell. rob zombie must have been high on drugs when he wrote this crud. a god chunk of it is just some drug-induced psychedelic mess.

i have to agree 100% with peter's review here, the star is a loud, foul mouthed, and extremely irritating and ignorant character, she is also a terrible actress in this movie unless you just want her for her screaming in y our face.

i've seen the original franchise, but i confess that ""halloween"" will never be a movie that i enjoy. it's simply not the style of horror i enjoy: ""slasher"" films are simply too ""campy"" and will probably scare only those whose fear is measured by the amount of fake blood used in the scene. however, carpenter's films acquired, with some merit, the character of classics. none of the older sequels even deserve to be used as a benchmark. they are simply awful, and it was the franciscan poverty of subsequent films that motivated rob zombie to take the franchise and start over from scratch. and if the first movie was bad, this one is worse.

the film wastes no time with introductions. starting at the point where the predecessor ends, it immediately transports us to the action, with a lot of deaths of characters that we do not know, and with which we do not care. the film thus functions as a virtual meat mincer. the script is downright amateurish, and an excuse for a horror film based solely on gratuitous bloodshed.

the actors are pretty bad. malcom mcdowell, who is usually a very good actor if he is well directed, has one of the worst works of his career in this film: in addition to having almost no time to do anything, the little he does is terribly bad, and the character is very bad. and unhappy. brad dourif does what he can, but in all fairness, i can't rate his effort beyond merely satisfying. even so, he is the best actor in the film. the rest of the cast is forgettable, or downright awful, and that includes the entirety of the female cast.

technically, the film bets heavily on cgi and liters of fake blood. the director completely forgot that the audience tends to feel the film more if they really sympathize, or care, with some of the characters, and in particular with the protagonist. instead, he offers us all the fake blood he could buy with his millionaire budget, and grotesque deaths. it's no more exciting or frightening than an expensive video game, but it must have brought in a nice bag of money for the main players...",low

tom hanks remains on top form as woody, as do all the others including buzz lightyear (tim allen) and jessie (joan cusack). ned beatty does a terrific job as lotso, while barbie and ken are brought to life well by jodi benson and michael keaton.

once again there are some excellent scenes, with the ending also being entertaining just like in <em>'toy story 2'</em>. there's also a lot of heart in the concluding scene. i'm surprised they did a fourth time, even if i do agree it's still a very good new instalment.

i have to say that i am at loss as to why. there are loads of much better films in the action/horror/fantasy genre’s that, at least the so called “critics” totally hammer. why the hell this trash got so good scores is beyond me.

the female acting consists of showing off your boobs then get eaten. the male acting consists of being an asshole, get your dick eaten, then get the rest eaten. the main “event” is a contrived scene when the main asshole get his dick bitten off and the piranhas eat it and spit it out again under water. i’m sure the 3d effects made it even more ridiculous than in 2d. i usually have rather high tolerance for poor acting and bad scripts when it comes to otherwise effects and gore loaded films but most of this film i was just thinking, “what the f... is this shit!”.

most of the film was just scenes stashed on top of each other designed to show of 3d effects with boobs and various ways a human could get eaten. this is a typical example of why 3d is bad for the movie industry.",low
1972,"in 1975, richard dreyfuss starred in jaws; 35 years later he had a cameo in piranha. his connection to the first film is obviously the only reason he’s in the second, wherein he’s killed off before his name even appears in the opening credits. 

dreyfuss is not alone, though; elisabeth shue and ving rhames also get to whore themselves out. in the latter's case, there was never any danger that piranha would result in another hand-me-down acting award for jack lemmon; on the other hand, rhames has easily the best scene in the entire movie — using an outboard motor in a way that would make ash williams proud. 

but i'm getting ahead of myself; shue and rhames first have to find the remains of dreyfuss, then capture a piranha which they take to christopher lloyd (in full doc brown mode), who identifies it as a species that has been extinct for two million years (according to the subtitles, lloyd calls it the ""regional piranha,"" but he may actually be saying ""original""; either way it doesn’t matter because neither term makes sense). 

an earthquake released the piranhas from an underground lake, or some such bullshit. q: ""how could they survive for so long cut off from the surface?"" a: ""cannibalism. they must have fought each other to survive.” until, presumably, there could be only one. piranha macleod? well, that would actually explain their apparent immortality.

piranha is supposed to be a comedy — or, specifically, it's a remake of a parody of jaws released three years after jaws and 32 before this one. in other words, this material was so diluted it was almost homeopathic. 

shue and rhames are big fish in a small pond here — kinda like those poor sea world orcas (i know they’re mammals; you get the idea, though); as such, the only emotion they inspire in the audience is pity over their career choices. 

only jerry o'connell, in a role no doubt based on joe francis (of girls gone wild infamy), moves as if he's in his own element — ​​because he is; he knows exactly, having been in several others of the same ilk, what kind of movie this is, and navigates it accordingly.",low

1985,"decent watch, probably won't watch again, but can recommend, especially for rock fans.

i've fantasized about dwayne johnson in a tutu as much as the next guy, but this is kind of the movie equivalent of when the rock went heel in the wwe (wwf at the time).  he's playing an obnoxious, borderline mean, character who isn't all that smart (basically a dumb jock type) , and while the movie is about redeeming the character it is hard for the character to be redeemed.

it's just awkward, he normally plays smart capable roles where he is likeable, as dwayne is naturally on-camera-likeable, so making him a jerk is hard, and they overcompensate.  you seem something closer to what they should have done in ""the pacifier"" where vin diesel is rough but well intended, and you can see elements of that in this, but he just goes full jerk.

i have a lot of issues with it being common practice to lie to children (which we teach them to be wary of when strangers do it), but digressing.

i have all sorts of issues with the logistics of a world where this type of tooth fairy exists, not to mention the other things they mention existing.  it's not too far off from the ""santa claus' sleigh flys by christmas cheer"", so there is a theoretical version of ""the santa claus"" in here somewhere.

so the movie doesn't make sense a lot, but it's a kids movie: which would be fine, but it wildly goes back and forth between goofy antics that should almost only make kids laugh, and high concept business jokes.

i think this movie tried to do too many things and ended up getting some of the fundamental things wrong.

1991,"you know people get up everyday, tell themselves something's gonna change their lives.

the town is charlestown, boston, a place where crime is a way of life. following a bank robbery, professional thief doug macray (ben affleck) has to keep a watch on bank manager claire keesey (rebecca hall) because after using her as hostage leverage during escape from the heist, she is the only witness who could possibly identify his gang. but once the two meet they start to fall for each other, forcing macray to re-evaluate his life in charlestown. it's a re-evaluation that will upset a lot of people close to him and the gangster boss who hires him, and all this at a time when fbi agent adam frawley (jon hamm) is closing in on the gang.

one of the most startling things about ben affleck's second film as director is that even with the conventional plot, and the formulaic characters, it's still an exhilarating and fresh picture. with affleck comfortable in his boston surroundings, it's evident that he and the team went for authenticity, something which in the main they achieve. sure there's the odd implausible moments, they are - like it or not - cops and robbers staples, but ""the town"" is not your standard run of the mill actioner. it is, for want of pigeon holing, a modern day noir, resplendent with bleak mood and well oiled characters. based on chuck hogan's novel ""prince of thieves"", pic follows the formula of a rotten town with rotten people doing their best or worst to live and get by. into the pot comes the bad guy who meets a good woman who wants to leave his crappy life and crappy home behind. so far so well trodden path, then, but this is not a giant gangland operation, like, say, ""the departed"" or ""the godfather"" et al, this is a small neighbourhood setting, with a small group of everyday dressed young men. it's one of the reasons why affleck's film feels so very authentic.

helping to exude the naturalistic and human feel of the drama is that affleck doesn't overdo his action sections, yet they are terrific sections for sure. this is not tony scott/don simpson/jerry bruckheimer action for popcorn excess. from the electric kick-start of the first heist, to the mid-section car chase - and to the knock out coup de grâce set in motion at red sox stadium - affleck shows great skill as a crafter of action - aided superbly by dylan tichenor's energised editing. other violence is swift and to the point, the director knowing not to dwell too long on vicious passages in the narrative, thus keeping his characters free of caricatures. mind, he is thankful to the great cast assembled for his picture, for this is very much an actors piece. well written without flabby periods of talk for talk sake, the town provides proper drama for proper actors - and that includes the director himself.

jeremy renner is quickly turning into the go to guy for edginess, here as macray's best pal, jem, he deals out a frightening loose cannon turn. chris cooper and pete postlethwaite have small roles, but both impact hard on proceedings, both memorable and both adding a touch of classy know how. hamm arguably has the hardest role, for as fbi agent frawley he has to carry on his own the other plot thread that is the investigation. not just that, but the film lends itself to one which dares you to root for the bad guys, it's a tough ask of the ""mad men"" actor but he nails it, with one two-fold scene in a bar, as he grills macray's ex, krista (blake lively heartfelt and believable), particularly offering a glimpse of what a good actor he can be. ultimately the main load has to be carried by affleck and hall as the central doomed lovers. there is death and misery every where in charlestown - and for the protagonists of the story, including doug & claire. their relationship offers hope, a beacon of hope in a murky world, but it's a relationship founded on black secrets and built around falsehoods. that affleck & hall draw us in with charm and acting gravitas further serves notice as to why the town is top draw stuff.

2002,"**a frankly well-made film, but very painful to watch and highly contraindicated for the most sensitive and grieving people.**

i cannot conceive of a pain stronger than that which a father or mother can feel when having to bury a child. no matter the causes of death, it must be as if the world, god or fate, whatever, took away a part of us that we couldn't live without. i have to confess, honorable reader, that i have never been in a comparable situation. i can only imagine, and i honestly don't want to go through that, nor do i wish that on anyone. i am still young, and the closest person i saw go was a loving grandfather, whose memory is still with me. i suffered with that loss, and that certainty of never seeing him again, but i faced it peacefully, after all, none of us live forever and the elders leave first… it's the nature of things.

this film addresses, precisely, the mourning of a child and the way in which the parents, each in their own way, live this pain and try to find ways to digest it. the world and society almost force us to overcome this after a certain moment, and return to normality. but what normality? there will be “normality” for a parent after something like this? these are questions that deserve reflection and that the film leaves open. we see that couple look at things differently: the father want to keep their son's memory, wants to feel surrounded by his things and touch his objects as if a portion of his son were inside them; the mother prefers to get rid of that objects and even move, in an effort to go forward where anger and frustration are vented on a lot of people around her. to what extent is it pain, not love, that unites them as a couple?

for all this, i need to leave a note of warning, advising this film for people who have lost someone and are going through a grieving, or for people with depression or who are more negative. it's not an easy movie, it's one of those movies that squeezes where it hurts the most. it is based on a play that nicole kidman had the good idea of ​​taking to the cinema, and the script is by the same author of the play. kidman brought the lead role to life with great skill, in a deeply psychological work, full of commitment and awarded with a nomination for an oscar. aaron eckhart brought the heartbroken father to life in a poignant, heartfelt way, in one of the actor's most interesting works. the film also has the frankly positive collaboration of sandra oh, tammy blanchard, diane west and miles teller.

the production wisely decided not to bet too much on big technical resources, giving the story and the cast's performance all the space needed to shine. even so, i wanted to leave a note of praise for the cinematography, with a good shooting work, low contrast, a palette of cold or pastel colors and a very well done editing, which gave the film a slower pace that seems to be perfectly adequate. without flashy visuals and sound, everything is elegant and discrete. the set of the couple's house is perhaps the most relevant, with the large, empty and almost impersonal spaces being, in practice, the mirror of a family that no longer exists, and of an increasingly distant couple.",high

but rickman was kind of out there on his own for most of the film and able to do his own thing and cut loose...while poor freeman was stuck opposite costner in every scene and, being a generous man he stepped back and gave kevin the opportunity to not even attempt to act.

here wen have, again, some pretty good actors and some pretty clever character actors...and russel crowe.

my issue with a lot of crowe movies is that he's not generous like freeman. he doesn't step back and let others do their thing so the movie will succeed.

crowe hogs as much of every scene as he can and, when he's not directly talking, moves, does things to draw your attention to him and not the other actors.

master and commander suffered for it. he was probably too afraid to do it opposite pacino in the insider, i can see bale being just as aggressive in 3:10 to yuma...but in robin hood, crowe is up to his old tricks again.

so you have the russel crowe show once more and that gets tiresome. it gets tiresome fast.

2028,"according to wikipedia, centurion “received mixed reviews and performed poorly at the box office” when it was released, but i wonder how many people picked up on its fascist undertones. 

the movie is set in britain during the roman invasion in 43 ad. now, unless it’s propaganda or revisionism, the long and short if it is, or should be, that in an invasion the invaders are the bad guys and the invaded the good guys – forget geopolitics; i’m talking about simple storytelling here. 

but centurion expects us to identify with the invading forces, a rapport that it slyly, yet deliberately, encourages by having the romans speak the queen’s english, while the native picts – the ‘others’, as it were – speak gaelic, a scottish language that even scots hardly know. in modern terms, what this movie wants from us is tantamount to asking us to cheer for nazis or, conversely, jeer at ukrainians. 

sure, the hero is but a soldier and, as we know from tennyson’s charge of the light brigade, a soldier’s lot is “not to reason why … but to do and die” – but precisely therein lies the problem. quintus dias (michael fassbender), and by extension writer/director neil marshall, never question warmongering; what does bother them, though, is “war without honor.” we are, therefore, meant to take a moral stance based on whether one side fights ‘dirty’ or not, without taking into account what each is fighting for. thus the picts, who are defending their home and freedom, are scorned because they “will not be drawn into open combat. instead, they pick at the scab until we bleed, hiding in the shadows like animals, striking hard and fast then falling back into the night.” never mind that the romans were the ones who drew first blood. 

meanwhile, the main antagonist is a character whose “village [was] slaughtered as punishment for resisting roman rule … they burnt out her father's eyes …. raped her mother until she was begging to die … before she too was raped … finally they cut out her tongue that she may not speak ill of the bloody roman empire.” 

that’s your plucky, underdog hero right there — but when it comes down to quintus and her, we’re somehow supposed to root for him. moreover, we are required to approve of quintus’s romantic interest, a woman called arianne who helps the romans out of spite because she has been ostracized by her fellow britons (i believe the denomination for such an individual is ‘collaborator’). quintus himself eventually turns his back on the roman empire – but only because they, for reasons not worth mentioning, try to kill him – in order to join arianne as a pariah. 

did marshall figure that, given enough time, one can look at history as if it were mythology – without the hindrance of having to make a distinction between right and wrong? after all, you can safely choose between greeks and trojan in the iliad and retain a clear conscience, but i shudder to think of a future where saving gefreiter reichmann would be a viable idea for a blockbuster.",low

2039,"the book of eli is one of those films that, at first glance, doesn't offer a terribly thrilling premise: a post-apocalyptic world, a lone wolf who fights for whatever is left of the good of mankind, and the young, naive and somewhat annoying girl he reluctantly takes under his wing. and of course, the bad guy. sure, there are many more films like this you can find at any local video store.

however, when you put two acting grandmasters like denzel washington and gary oldman head to head, you already know you're in for a treat. and in that respect, ""eli"" absolutely delivers. denzel washington, in the role of eli, does what he does best: he delivers his most perfect rough-around-the-edges, i'm-a-good-guy-but-i-don't-care routine we all know and love. he is a hard knock alright, and he has absolutely no problem whatsoever severing a few of your body parts if you get in his way. but he is still good to the core, one of the few decent human beings left in a world forsaken of decency. all you need to do to know this is look in his eyes, because the warmth and charisma washington possesses say it all, even if he is completely covered in scar tissue.

and then there's gary oldman. good old gary oldman. i have to say, it's really nice to see him play a stone cold, heartless scumbag once again, especially after his soft good guy role in batman, where he was almost dorky – to no fault of his own of course, but still. this man deserves to get every inch of space to act freely, and thank goodness, the hughes brothers allowed him exactly that. he plays a sort of mob boss, the self-appointed leader of a dingy little town and owner of the bar. he beats his wife, prostitutes his stepdaughter and he does it smiling. he is the most filthy kind of evil, absolutely rotten and loving it. why? we don't know. he's just a bastard, and that's that.

which is another thing i really like about this film, even though i realize many other people might actually hate it: it offers absolutely no motives, no answers, no explanations to anything, no bite size plot lines, nothing. there's no intro, no voice-over telling you where we are and what's going on. only half-way through the film there is a scene with eli and solara (played by mila kunis) where he tells her a little bit about his life, but that's it. like i said, some people might hate this, so if you are the kind of person who likes a formula-driven action flick with catchy punch lines and nothing to think about, this is not the film for you.

i would also like to make a little note on mila kunis. i must admit, i first had some doubts about her taking on a genre like this (although i was impressed with her performance in black swan, but that's a completely different kind of film, and other than that i only know her from that 70's show), and throughout her first couple of scenes, she didn't do much to remove those doubts. however, as the film progressed, she got her act together and in the end, delivered a credible performance.

the visuals are stunning from start to finish. if you are a fan of the new, frank miller type of film style with high contrast colours and surreal scenery, you really need to see this. the bleak colours and images of darkness set against a really bright sky make the atmosphere heavy and haunting, making the anxiety of the characters almost tangible. you can just feel dryness, the desert, the hunger and the thirst. the western-like scenery of the town with the ""saloon"" at the heart of it, only adds to that sensation.

another thing i'd like to mention is a quality not many modern-day films possess: the lost art of being silent. it is very rare for a film in this genre to simply be so... still. there is no dialogue except where it's absolutely necessary, and even the music is only used to actually add something to the scenes, but never as filler. the absence of sound here is just as important as its presence. perfect.

on a similar note, the final credits go to atticus ross, who created an absolutely magnificent soundtrack, with music that sounds somewhat like the hybrid lovechild of trent reznor and thom yorke. it's just stellar and truly adds (emotional) value to every scene.

finally, i'm not going to tell you what the story is about, i will simply recommend that you go into it with an open mind and no prior knowledge. that's what i did and it worked perfectly. (i will only say that you really need to stick around for the awesome, slap-in-the-face plot twist at the end!)

of course it's not the best film ever made, but i still give it a 10, simply because it's beautiful, it's cool and it delivers a few excellent and satisfactory action scenes. and because it's been a really long time since i have downloaded a soundtrack immediately after seeing the film.

original? no. eye-candy? absolutely.

go see it.

2055,"**lots of style, lots of high-quality visuals, but little substance.**

there are things that are inexplicable, and one of them is how “tron” managed to become popular, even after not being a big hit in its time. i have already written about it and i stand by what i said: it is a film that i understand, that came in the wake of a popular fever around everything electronic, but that was made before its time, with visual and special effects that, today, seem as archaic as a 1990s cell phone. i don't know if this movie should be a sequel or if it should have been made a remake instead, but there's no doubt about the superiority of this movie: not only does it feature visual effects and cgi of great beauty and quality, as it has a frankly better script (which does not mean perfection).

indeed, the script is satisfactory, presenting an unlikely story, where a very rich young man decides to sabotage his own company thinking he is doing what his father, who disappeared for years, would approve. after that, he receives a message from his father, and the clue leads him to an old arcade, long closed, and to his father's old computer. it is there that the young man is sucked into a cybernetic space, controlled by a vile and dictatorial program. yes, humans sucked, physically speaking, into computers. as if social media weren't enough! added to this, the worn-out clichés of the relationship between an absent father and a needy son, an essay on a loving sub-plot without any logic, a cartoon villain without personality and made to hate.

jeff bridges returns to the character he played in the first film, both in the person of the actor we know, and in the figure of a young alter-ego, created digitally. the actor is good, and we already know his merits, but the truth is that he doesn't seem to be in great shape. he accompanies the film, following the action, but he is not particularly noticeable in this work, as he was not in the initial film. garrett hedlund has a little more visibility and is, in fact, the protagonist here, but he doesn't do much more than be an action figure.

it is in the technical aspects that the film stands out and deserves some praise, particularly thanks to the extraordinary design of the visual effects and the cgi, which are among the most elegant and well-executed we have seen. recreating the concepts of the original film, they show a cleaner and more finished look, without obvious gimmicks that are unbelievable to the eyes, and with much better worked colors. however, a film is not made of style and extraordinary visuals, and there are many recent examples of visually amazing films that are worthless because they do not have quality stories. also noteworthy are the sets and costumes, as well as the electronic soundtrack, by the french dj duo daft punk.",low

jaden smith is amazing in this movie. i kept on saying that will and jada pinkett made a good investment in their son. just like his parents, he's a great actor. he's good in both drama and comedy. he did well in this movie. there were even ""kilig"" moments with him. i just love him. 


jackie chan is of course amazing as well. his character was an older man but that didn't stop him from having a fight scene of his own. we all know he has great comedic timing but i was really impressed when he did his dramatic acting in this movie. it's a different jackie chan. and that's what makes him great. he has always something to surprise his audience with.


jaden's nemesis is also great. he's scary. but i like the pictures of behind the scenes in the end because it showed that he's not that scary after all. he looks like a nice guy who's friends with jaden.

2070,i can not understand which was the purpose of this remake . a really bad choice . a movie which was 100 times worst than the original one . it was a waste of time for me . i am a huge karate kid fan but this one was one of the worst remakes i have ever seen .,low
2075,"this is a pretty movie. its apparent from the start, that this remake of the 1984 classic, has a pretty good sized budget to work with. in fact the budget for this incarnation was $35 million according to wikipedia. the budget for the wes craven original, $1.8 million. you don't always get a better movie if your budget is huge, look at avatar. you just get a really pretty movie that looks polished and has flawless special effects. again, see avatar. that movie was nothing but flash. the story is unoriginal and weak... and don't try coming at me with this whole ""shut up man! avatar proved itself!"" shut up! the larger budget in this case makes the movie look too polished to be takes seriously. why the hell are we caring about watching clones of the twilight teens being chased by freddy kruger? were not. this movie didn't need a budget of $35 million. it feels wasted. some of the appeal of the original came from watching the director be a director and figure scenes out. this movie didn't do that. it felt trite and forced.

freddy kruger is less of a movie villain in the horror industry and more of an icon. everyone i knew growing up all had freddy kruger nightmares when they were a kid. perhaps this new version of freddy will serve to scare the shit out of kids these days. i would hope so. maybe when they remake this movie again in twenty years they will bitch about it then as well. who knows.",low

2083,"clint eastwood has once again proved himself to be a formidable director. the style and structure of storytelling used in hereafter will not appeal to a large audience, but something tells me he knew this all too well but honestly, didn't care and rightfully so. because let's face it, he can afford it and it's certainly a privilege he has earned. and with hereafter, it seems that all mr. eastwood wants to do is share a story. a very beautiful one at that.

hereafter is divided into three story lines, spread over three different countries. we have matt damon as a reluctant psychic in the united states, cécile de france who plays a journalist in france and a young pair of twin brothers (frankie and george mclaren) in england. all of these peoples' lives are in one way or another affected by different aspects of death, whether that be a near-death experience or the passing of someone very dear. or, in damons case, the ability to establish a certain connection with those who are no longer with us. eastwood has decided on a particularly art house-like approach, which, like i mentioned earlier, will certainly back off a large amount of potential viewers. however, i personally very much appreciate his decision. he has obviously chosen not to make this some big, hyped-up monster movie about all things paranormal. instead, hereafter deals with its subject with great integrity and subtlety. although, despite said subtlety, it features a few moments which are, by contrast, incredibly intense and shocking (in a non-scary way). in fact, i would even go so far as to say it is not for the faint of heart, but i mean that mostly in an emotional sense, rather than a spectacular one. on a side note, i would actually not recommend this film to anyone who has, in any way, shape or form been confronted with the 2004 tsunami, or even the london terrorist attacks. it might be really confronting, so be advised.

i personally think the film's user rating is a bit low, but on the other hand i do somewhat understand why this film has not received the appreciation it deserves. simply put, not everyone (actually, many people) will not understand it. it is a small story, for a small audience. also, anyone watching this because they think it's all about matt damon will be somewhat deceived. i fully understand why they put his name and picture on the poster, since he is the only big name on the payroll. but this is really not 'his' film, he just plays a part in it. and he does it well, but the rest of the cast actually deserves a great deal of credit, because they are quite simply phenomenal. and i mean *all* of them. cécile de france is really impressive, she plays her part with great dignity and empathy. she truly carries every scene she's in, and she will definitely do her country proud. personally, i was most affected (both story- and acting wise) by the 'london segment' of the film. the story of the two young brothers is absolutely heartbreaking, and the mclaren boys do a superb job at translating this onto the screen. anyone who doesn't at least feel a shudder of emotion when watching their story unfold, well... honestly doesn't have a lot of heart. i refuse to give away any plot points at all, other than what i already have. this is really the kind of story you just need to surrender to in order to really appreciate it. the pacing demands some patience, but if this is your kind of film it really won't be too much trouble and you will be greatly rewarded.

the way the story unfolds (the three-way structure, which doesn't come together until the very end), inevitably evokes comparison to 'babel', but honestly, that one cost me a far greater deal of effort to sit through than hereafter. but that is entirely personal of course, and the structure is really the only similarity between the two; the stories are completely different. and i also think hereafter is actually far more accessible than babel, despite its subject matter. the stories are told with such tenderness that it didn't actually bother me at all that they were three separate stories which, until the end, had nothing to do with each other. they all intrigued me in their own personal way.

actually, i could go on and on...

it's been a long time since a film has really touched my heart, but this one has. i've been thinking about what rating i should give it, but honestly, i can't think of a single reason why i wouldn't give this film a 10. hereafter is a film of true beauty, a real gem. which, unfortunately, won't be understood by many people, but who knows... perhaps someday, its time will come.

2118,"**a film that seemed very promising, but ended up being very disappointing.**

i have to say that i have never read _the tempest_ and i needed, before seeing the film, to read a little about the original play. personally, i really like the works of william shakespeare and have read several of his plays. and i've also noticed that the most staunch defenders of the renowned author's work are sometimes quite suspicious of cinematographic approaches. to some extent, i understand them, but i am also able to understand the need to make adaptations, cuts or changes. perhaps the most shocking or questionable, in this case, is the change of sex of the central character, who would be a man and here was played very well by helen mirren.

the script essentially follows the story that almost everyone will know better than i, who have not yet read the book: prospera, the duchess of milan, is expelled from her lands by king alonso of naples and her brother antonio. accused of witchcraft, she flees with her daughter, miranda, and manages to reach an island inhabited by a creature, caliban. twelve years later, miranda is a beautiful young woman, of marriageable age, and chance blows again in prospera's favor when the men who removed her from power board a ship that, by magical arts, sinks in a furious storm, forcing them shipwrecked on her island.

the film is pleasant, but it suffers from a major flaw that is common in films with theatrical material, particularly shakespearean adaptations: it sounds contrived and overly staged when it should sound more natural and realistic. cinema wants actors not to act, speak or behave as if they were in a theater. if i wanted to see the original play, i would buy a theater ticket. i understand director julie taymor's effort to maintain fidelity to the dialogues and source material, but the truth is that she should have made the necessary adaptations, and sought to achieve greater realism and authenticity, both through the dialogues and material given to the actors, as through his personal effort in directing the scenes. the affected modes and complicated dialogues are not suitable for a cinematographic work.

with these notes, it's easy to understand how much the cast's efforts were conditioned by the material received. the cast is good, it has several great actors, with proven evidence, but it doesn't manage to give us a truly good final product that corresponds to their merits and talents. as i mentioned, helen mirren is the main actress, in the role of prospera. it was a risky gesture, both for her and for director taymor, but the truth is that mirren did a good job and proved to be up to the challenge. another actor worth mentioning is djimon hounsou. in the role of caliban, the actor showed great physical expression and good vocal modulation. also, ben whishaw leaves us an interesting and well done work, although more contained and heavily supported in cgi. the rest of the cast just do what they really need to do. on the negative side, i would highlight felicity jones, for the total absence of presence and charisma, and also reeve carney, who is too sugary and idealistic.

technically, the film leaves a lot to be desired, and in many ways it still appears to be an incomplete project. the cinematography is pretty bad: it's incomprehensible why they didn't think of betting on a more vibrant, colorful and spectacular visual, where the cgi gained additional strength and the hawaiian landscapes were better enjoyed and more impressive! editing is regular, but the film's pace is still quite slow and sometimes tiring. although some costumes try to bring to the film an aroma of the renaissance period, the fact is that the clothes worn by the actors lack any kind of historical realism. there is a lot of green screen in the film, but the visual and sound effects are weak, and the cgi used is amateurish.",low
2124,"when i first saw the trailer of easy a, i wasn't particularly intrigued. it looked like just another high school teenage comedy. but then i decided to watch it anyway (mostly because i wanted to know what all the fuss was about), and it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise! coincidentally, i had just seen emma stone for the first time two days ago, when i watched zombieland, and i thought to myself, ""hey this girl seems kind of cool"". but that still wasn't an answer as to why right now i can't read a single magazine without seeing her face somewhere. after seeing easy a, i finally know. this girl is fun. she has a great talent for comedy of the driest, most sarcastic kind and a perfect sense of timing. and you've got to love that husky voice.

easy a is about a girl, olive, who's a straight a-student with a flawless reputation, until she tells a little white lie to her best friend about how she supposedly lost her virginity to a guy that doesn't even exist. however, things go awry when this little anecdote spreads like wildfire and all of a sudden she has a reputation of being a hussy. (this plot line demands some suspension of disbelief, because it's obviously very hard to believe that any group of high school students would be shocked at the thought of one of their peers _*having sex*_, but whatever.) of course, like with any rumour, it changes constantly depending on who you talk to. so before olive knows what hit her, everybody in school thinks she slept with every guy around. now here's the twist: once it becomes clear that she can use this newfound reputation to her advantage, she does so to the fullest. simply put: unpopular guys pay her to pretend she had sex with them. obviously, at some point things get out of hand and she has to find a way to fix it all again.

this concept could have been really stupid, if it wasn't for the great screenplay. it is a tribute to classic 80's teenage films including, of course, john hughes, and it also features some great references to the scarlet letter and sylvia plath. the dialogue is quick and witty, and the characters are all really typical people without being cliché stereotypes. stanley tucci is a delight as olive's dad, bringing the same kind of dry-as-a-bone humour to the table as his on-screen daughter. patricia clarkson is a wonderful actress, and as it turns out, a really funny one as well. all the actors are perfectly cast.

one of the funniest elements in easy a is a group of christian students, the 'jesus freaks'. the leader of this little group is a girl called marianne, played by amanda bynes. she just can't stop preaching to olive about her 'indecent behaviour' and the dialogue between the two provides some of the funniest moments throughout the film. here's a small foretaste; marianne: ""there's a higher power that will judge you for your indecency."" olive: ""tom cruise?"" 

overall, this is mostly a 'chuckle' comedy rather than a 'rolling over the floor laughing' comedy, though it has some really good lol moments. and the 'chuckles' are widespread.

i would definitely recommend watching easy a if you're in the mood for a witty, intelligent comedy about a smart, sassy girl who takes control of her own life and everybody who thinks they have a right to think badly about her.

2127,"if you enjoy reading my spoiler-free reviews, please follow my blog @
https://www.msbreviews.com

here we go with the fourth review of a david fincher's film this week, in preparation for the upcoming mank, directed by the same person who delivered phenomenal movies like se7en, fight club, zodiac, and more. now, it's time for the social network, which premise can be summed up in ""the story behind the creation of facebook"". ten years have passed since its release, and the real mark zuckerberg already stated that most of the film is based on fictional events and conversations. truth is, this movie was never marketed as a true story, but yes as an adaptation of ben mezrich's 2009 book the accidental billionaires. it's a film like any other, not a detailed account of whatever happened in real life.

with that said, this is easily one of the best adapted screenplays of all-time. aaron sorkin, the man behind one of the best movies of 2020 (the trial of the chicago 7), demonstrates his incredibly talented writing skills in the social network, proving that he's one of the most meticulous writers working today. if you've been reading my previous reviews, there's a couple of compliments i keep giving to fincher, which are his extreme attention to detail and his impressive dedication to the narrative he wants to tell. so, what happens when you put together two of the most perfectionist filmmakers ever? an award-worthy, ""best of the year"" contender arises from their gifted minds.

there's not even much to discuss besides the narrative itself since this is, by far, the aspect that elevates the whole film. jeff cronenweth, who previously worked in fight club, brings out fincher's trademark realistic look and feel through his simple yet powerful cinematography. trent reznor and atticus ross' original score is packed with little effects that resemble computer sounds, making it quite addictive while also increasing the movie's energy in the most exciting sequences. finally, just like in zodiac, the editing work (angus wall, kirk baxter) is absolutely seamless, and it's definitely the technical component that better helps sorkin's screenplay shine due to the latter's structure.

throughout the entire runtime, the story is told through a nonlinear timeline, mixing up facebook's actual creation (ideas, planning, programming) with the future legal issues that mark zuckerberg faces. this structure allows for an exceptionally captivating and tremendously entertaining couple of hours by never letting the pacing slow down or to have an uneventful sequence. the protagonist is accused of stealing the concept from the winklevoss twins (both interpreted by armie hammer), gets in trouble with his best friend, eduardo saverin (andrew garfield), over the website's monetization, and sean parker (justin timberlake) is partially the trigger for a lot of the chaos that ends up overwhelming zuckerberg's life.

sorkin and fincher's greatest accomplishment is their success in making the viewer feel invested in a main character who's an utter ""asshole"", an adjective with a lot of weight in the film. jesse eisenberg is remarkable as one of those characters people ""love to hate"" (no wonder the real zuckerberg didn't enjoy the movie since he's depicted as a contemptible friend). eisenberg has a unique manner of speaking and distinctive mannerisms that are perfect for this character. garfield and timberlake are also formidable, incorporating their characters effortlessly. once again, comparing with zodiac, the social network is also a dialogue-driven narrative, but the latter resonated with me a bit more due to my area of work.

the only issue i have involves the winklevoss family. armie hammer is excellent as both twins, as is max minghella as divya narendra, but their subplot occasionally drifts from the main story, losing my interest for those short moments. there's even a rowboat race that feels out-of-place and unnecessary, but i admit that it's gorgeously shot and accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack. despite this little misstep, fincher continues to impress me with his outstanding directing techniques, forcing the actors to prove their worth by making them go through their dialogues faster and implementing long takes every time that's possible.

all in all, the social network is yet another masterful piece of cinema, this time delivered by not one but two magnificent filmmakers. david fincher and aaron sorkin employ their mutual perfectionism and meticulousness to create an extraordinarily engaging narrative. boasting a nonlinear but tremendously effective structure, the two pillars of any film - story and characters - are wonderfully built, even reaching the point of making the viewer feel invested in a despicable yet fascinating protagonist. jesse eisenberg shines in a career-defining performance, but andrew garfield and justin timberlake also rise to the necessary level of dedication, dealing with the rapid-fire dialogues and outstanding long takes seamlessly. technically, great camera work offers a realistic feel, an addictive score increases the excitement levels, and flawless editing makes the different timelines shift seamlessly. despite an occasionally unnecessary, irrelevant detour concerning a minor subplot, this is another brilliant addition to fincher's filmography.

2128,"full review: <a>https://www.tinakakadelis.com/beyond-the-cinerama-dome/2021/12/28/no-new-friends-the-social-network-review<a>

perhaps no other website has altered the course of the 21st century like facebook. its launch in 2004 forever changed the way society talks about social media and connects with friends and strangers, and became the lightning rod of a multitude of controversies. conspiracy theories, political propaganda, and mass surveillance became the norm. all of it a far cry from the basic “hot or not” site facebook sprang from.

_the social network_ takes the audience back to that fateful night at harvard when a primitive version of facebook was born in the dorm room of mark zuckerberg (jesse eisenberg) and eduardo saverin (andrew garfield). director david fincher and writer aaron sorkin are a dream team in this film. sorkin’s signature quick dialogue is a perfect match for the pace of this movie. it gives zuckerberg a smarminess that is easy for the audience to rally against, as though creating a website that objectifies women simply because his girlfriend dumped him isn’t enough to cause immediate dislike.",high

2139,"boring watch, won't watch again, and can't recommend.

paul rudd (especially) and jack nicholson are actors i would use as a barometer for movie quality, and even reese witherspoon (even though i'm not a big fan) usually is in quality movies, but this is just such a dud.

it's the rom com equivalent to watching paint dry.  everything about it draws enormous attention to what you would expect to be happening and not doing it.  trust me, i understand that subversion of expectation is comedy, but there is a rate of diminishing returns on the repetition and duration of the joke, and if you play with that line, then you're writing a comedy for comedy writers because they are the only ones that are going to look at the movie / life as a punchline, and i don't think that is what they were going for.

there is an underlying theme of patience and adaptability: life will even out even in the roughest of situations, but the movie just sort of stops without even an epilogue, they're just literally and suddenly not there anymore.

i think there is a lot to get out of the movie, if you're strong enough to reach for it: a man who has everything but doesn't give you what you need isn't as good a man who has almost nothing and wants to give you what you need.  it's a counter argument to ""nice guys finish last"".

the 'grow old together' scene stuck with me the most.

2164,"if paul haggis is going to keep on making movies, would somebody do us all a favor and sign him up for a basic screenwriting class? i mean, please, this film could be a lesson all on its own on how not to write a decent screenplay. its all in here: one-dimensional characters, supremely poor pacing, multiple threads that go absolutely nowhere and completely implausible action sequences.

and, you know, it's just a b-thriller. it's not like i haven't seen these mistakes time and time again. what really bothers me is just how highly it thinks of itself. it not only thinks it's interesting (which it isn't whatsoever), but it thinks it's smart, edgy, and it probably even thinks it's clever. i mean, there are so many characters who function for exactly one plot point and are then left behind in the dust. for example, this one chick who's name i forget (did they ever even say her name?) is introduced fairly early on in the film, and looks even like russell crowe's love interest. we see the very, very beginnings of a meaningful relationship forming and then it turns out that she was only a device to fill in a little potential plot hole (trying not to spoil the movie.) the same with russell crowe's parents, there are a handful of scattered scenes with them showing little glimpses of a meaningful relationship, and then the same exact friggin' thing is done, they're used as a simple (and illogical) plot mechanism.

it's almost like one of paul haggis's friends was reading the script and said ""hey, paul, this is completely ridiculous, how could they possibly manage to _________"" and haggis wrote in these characters as devices to satisfy the issue, realized they were one-dimensional, and wrote in a pseudo-intelligent relationship (which doesn't in reality make them any better.) and this is how the first 2/3 of the movie moves so dreadfully slowly. i mean, i'm absolutely confident that with a decent editor, the first hour and fifteen minutes could be whittled down to maybe half an hour.

they could have especially left out the symbols that don't actually symbolize anything. which seems silly to say, but the jar of quarters that keeps recurring in the movie not only has no plot significance, but has zero metaphorical significance. they barely explained what they were doing in their house. they were quite literally only in the film to make it look a little deeper. not to make it more meaningful, but to make it look more meaningful. to make it ""smart,"" and ""edgy,"" and ""clever."" i don't usually have a problem with making it through a movie but i had to push to make it through this ludicrous, self-righteous mess.",low
2169,"bloody and bloody hilarious.

tucker & dale vs evil is directed by eli craig who also co-writes the screenplay with morgan jurgenson. it stars alan tudyk, tyler labine, katrina bowden and jesse moss. music is by michael shields and andrew kaiser and cinematography by david geddes. plot has tudyk and labine as two harmless mountain/country men who head to their newly acquired vacation home in the woods to fix it up and get some r & r. but after a misunderstanding at a roadside store with some college kids, who think tucker & dale are hillbilly psychopaths, the wheels are set in motion for a bloody battle for survival, but who for?!

in 1996 scream came slashing forward to inject witty life into a fading horror genre, with freshness and inventive splinters from the slasher formula, wes craven's movie rocked the horror faithful's world. tucker & dale vs evil will not have the same impact, its limited release and low budget worth ensured it never had a chance of being a big thing, but still it's the freshest horror/comedy to have come out since scream made its bloody bow at the box office.

it's such a simple idea at the core, you have to wonder why it wasn't thought of before? craig and jurgenson have flipped the age old hillbilly killers vs preppy college kids idea on its head, and in the process smothered it gleefully with dark humour, laugh out loud moments and inventive deaths. there's also some social comedy nestled nicely in the narrative, big points about first impressions and ideas of stereotypes, and hell yes! there's even an opposites attract arc - though that admittedly helps to bog the picture down as the central joke premise runs out of steam towards the end. in fact were it not for a relatively sloppy finale, this would surely be falling into sub-genre classic status. thankfully all that comes before it is so full of vim and vigour, blood and bluff and fun and frolics, it's not hard to forgive the debut director his one misstep.

the neat trick is having the film unfold from the hillbillies viewpoint, where the carnage that unspools gets increasingly difficult for them to explain, this in spite of their innocence. each death is logical to the college kids who go on the attack when one of their number, they think, is kidnapped. and it's logical to us the audience as well, were it not for us being privy to these wonderfully funny sequence of events, we too would have them hung, drawn and quartered after a guilty verdict was reached in 10 seconds. this is the ultimate horror/comedy flip-flop movie. so many funny sequences light up the picture, with a chainsaw scene one of the finest moments to have ever graced a horror comedy movie, but the dialogue, too, is not found wanting in the fun and charming department. cast are on top form, with tudyk & labine a most agreeable double act, where their comedy timing is impeccable, and bowden & moss are more than just pretty faces.

craig (sally field's son) has started with a bang, if he can top this then he is a name to really get excited about. if he can't top it? well he will at least always have one of the best horror comedy movies on his cv. yes it's that good, fans of scream, severance, shaun of the dead and zombieland should seek it out post haste. 8.5/10",high

2174,"the gift of cinema does credit to the gift of speech.

the king's speech is directed by tom hooper and written by david seidler. it stars colin firth, geoffrey rush, helena bonham carter, guy pearce, timothy spall, derek jacobi & michael gambon. music is by alexandre desplat and photography is by danny cohen. the idea for the film came about after seidler read about how king george vi (firth) overcame his stammer after a friendship was formed with his voice coach lionel logue (rush). having himself overcome a stutter problem in his youth, seidler set about writing his story from informed information. a bonus came before filming started when notebooks belonging to logue were put forward for use. these enabled seidler to incorporate works from the books into the screenplay. plot picks up just prior to george's brother, edward (pearce), abdicating the throne, thus thrusting the stammering george on to the hottest seat in england. with world war looming, george will be needed to make the speech of speeches to becalm his nation, but first he must work closely with the affable logue and hope it brings an end to his vocal woes.

i first viewed the king's speech just a couple of days before the academy awards that year, so i didn't know how it was going to perform there. it would garner the academy award for best picture, best director (hooper), best actor (firth) and best original screenplay (seidler), with 12 nominations in total. this was a year when oscar and bafta (where it won 7 of the 14 categories it was nominated for - including best film and best actor for colin firth) got things right. the film at that time i watched it had already made over $230 million in profit, which was a figure guaranteed to rise considerably since the film was still playing to packed theatres in the uk (which was indeed the case as the last figure put forward was $412 million).

i myself ventured to the theatre on 22nd february 2011, which was over 6 weeks after it was first released in its homeland. as i approached the cinema i saw there was a queue! a queue? i haven't queued to get into a film since the halcyon days of jaws, star wars and close encounters of the third kind! i noticed there was many youngsters in this line, so of course they were going to see the yogi bear movie, or that gnomeo & juliet film, surely? not so actually. in they went to see the king's speech, an audience that ranged from 12 years of age to the fragile oap day trippers. for the next two hours the only sounds i heard were that of laughter, hushed words of praise for what was on the screen, and even sobs during some of the more tender moments within. no mobile phones, no chitter chatter about acne or the boy next door, just an across the board appreciation for expert film making.

there in is the reason why the king's speech coined it in at the box office and broke merry records as it went on its way. it has universal appeal, a film without tricks, just a simple involving story acted supremely by a cast of bona fide thespians. it beats a true heart,  whilst doling out a visual history lesson to those so inclined to matters of the british monarchy and the political upheaval about to surface as adolf started his surge. even for a film so chocked full of dialogue and basic human interactions, the pace is brisk and never sags, the quieter reflective moments only bringing anticipation of the next enjoyable scene. when all is said and done, the king's speech success snowballed because of word of mouth, it started out as an intended independent picture, to be shown in selected theatres only, and now it holds up as one of the best films of 2010/2011. believe me, believe the hype, that if you still haven't seen it then you owe it to yourself to see this beautiful movie. 10/10",high

2182,"**the movie works well, but there are some details in the story told that, to me, make little sense. am sorry.**

generally, i don't really like films that are too apologetic, that is, films that use cinema to advocate and defend causes, political ideas, social movements. it's ok to be part of the plot of a movie, but to make a movie for defense/publicity of these ideas is another very different thing. when i started to see this movie, i was scared to find just another movie defending the gay lobby, and its social and political flags.

well, now that i'm done, i'm relieved that my fears didn't go beyond that. the film has a fairly regular script, which seeks to tell an interesting story, focused on how a man begins a very passionate relationship with a charming frenchwoman he has just met. he was very depressed because of the recent death of his father, and while the film tells us how the couple evolves in their new relationship, it also tells us how was, lately, the relationship between him and his father who, shortly after widowing, decides to tell his son that he is sick and is going to die of cancer and, moreover, that despite having been married, he has been a homosexual all his life, suffering at the cost of that secret and having a secret boyfriend.

the strong point of the film is not only the dramatic story told (i never felt it was a comedy, as some say, despite having few funny moments in between), but also the original way in which it is told to us, with flashbacks and in a very visual way, using photographs and a very visual and interesting narrative style. there are certain moments when i felt that the narrator (the son) was actually presenting slides to the audience, which is us. and with that, i felt that mike mills, the director, took a calculated risk, and it turned out very well. unfortunately, i felt that the homosexual subplot is not as credible. i simply cannot conceive how such a sick and elderly man would be in a loving relationship with someone who is almost his son's age. it's not a situation i can believe in… not because it's a gay relationship… but because of the age difference and health situation.

in addition to the good story and the elegant way in which it is told, the film brings us a luxurious cast of great actors, with an evident highlight for the veteran christopher plummer, who gives us a moving and extremely worthy portrait of that father. by his side, and equally impactful and powerful, ewan mcgregor, in one of the strongest works i remember seeing him do. and this is not an understatement, as we know that mcgregor is a great actor, and he has already proved to us what he can do on other occasions. melanie laurent, fresh out of ""inglorious bast…ds”, has another excellent work here, although her character is not as remarkable and interesting as the two male leads. goran visnjic, unfortunately, has the most thankless role. i felt like he's really the most in the movie.

technically, the film is discreet, but effective, and bets a lot on interesting and well-crafted cinematography, with visuals that we can appreciate as the film unfolds. the editing is good, the pace is pleasant, and the sets and costumes are within what we could have expected to find. the soundtrack doesn't stand out or stand out.",low

2187,"127 hours depicts the true story of a guy named aron ralston, who went canyoneering in utah in april 2003. through a pretty serious event of misfortune, he gets trapped in a canyon by a boulder that pulverises his arm against the canyon wall; literally between a rock and a hard place. and, the desperate measures he resorts to in order to free himself. from a hollywood perspective, this sounds like it could be turned into a wildly spectacular action film with a bold, heroic protagonist, hysterical relatives and ""where is my son? please find my son!!"" (*intense sobbing*) - type of dialogue. yes? no. boy, am i glad this was directed by danny boyle... the man we all know for his raw, authentic film style. instead of aforementioned blockbuster drama, he opted for an incredibly realistic, documentary-like film. 127 hours starts off with no form of introduction whatsoever. we do not get to 'meet' aron or any of his relatives. however, any such introduction quickly proves to be redundant as, over the fast-paced opening credits, we see aron enthusiastically preparing for and taking off on a hiking trip (ignoring his mother's phone call in the process...), and there you have it: this is a 'too cool for school', overconfident adrenaline junkie, and that's all we need to know. this overconfidence gradually proves to be the source of pretty much all his problems, as it is later on revealed that aron neglected to tell anyone where he was going... oops.

like i said, this film looks and feels very much like a documentary, like national geographic made a big budget reconstruction of the event. the film makers' choice to cast james franco was a very good one. he is simply amazing. mind you – he is alone in this film for about 95% of the time. this requires an actor with the guts and skill to carry an entire film, and i must admit, franco probably wouldn't have been my first choice. but – to my pleasant surprise – he pulls it off, and is actually very worthy indeed of his oscar nomination. he displays an impressively wide range of emotions, all equally convincing. panic, disbelief, despair, delusion, hurt and hallucinations. but even confidence, coolness, exhilaration and rationality; it's all there. aron ralston, as a character, starts off as a seemingly quite cocky, confident, care-free dude who just wants to enjoy himself and do what he loves most: exploring nature. without telling his family. but as the film progresses, and aron realises just what kind of mess he's in, you can slowly see a change occurring in him. and the fact that, after a while you greatly start to sympathize with him and even admire him, despite his obvious stupidity before, is all due to james franco. he has really proved himself to be a very fine character actor with the capability of moving his audience. there is one scene in particular which i found really captivating. during the 'tuesday' scene, aron records himself on his camcorder, acting like he's on a talk show, answering his own questions. this scene is top-notch, acting wise, and this is where you really start to feel for him. 

throughout aron's ordeal, we are shown various flashbacks of his childhood, friends, family and loves. this might seem like a cliché, but honestly, what else are you supposed to think about when you're stuck in a canyon for five days? some people have suggested they think aron to be a superficial person for not having some kind of spiritual enlightenment while he was trapped, but honestly, i don't think it's anybody's business to judge what aron thought and felt throughout his ordeal. we all deal with hardship in our own personal way, and talking to god is not necessarily an option for everyone. some of us simply draw support from family and love and good memories. i know that's what i'd do. 

now, back to technical talk. the sense of realism of 127 hours comes greatly from the grainy, unsteady camera work and graphic depiction of everything. which is a note that comes with a warning: this film is not for the faint of heart. what surprised me is that the scene where aron 'releases' himself is visually very graphic. i won't go into detail, but you really shouldn't watch this if you don't have the stomach.

there were only a few minor things which bothered me during this film. it has a few moments which, inevitably are a teeny bit boring. but then again, even that seems to fit into the story, so perhaps it makes sense. and i personally think the music wasn't always very well chosen, some of it didn't really fit somehow. but none of this is really any bother.

127 hours may not be as profound as into the wild, but it's certainly a very well-crafted film which deserves respect on its own merits. also, the photography of the film is really beautiful and some of the scenery of the canyons is truly breathtaking. i would recommend it for the pretty pictures alone. anyhow, if you're interested in a really good episode of ""i shouldn't be alive"", this is the film for you.

it's starts off really cool, the wounded man alone in the desert, clearly just after a fight...and then it gives you the very real feeling that you've seen it before, the only difference is the alien technology on his wrist.

2224,"**visually grandiose and made with true technical and artistic mastery, it is a film with difficult and indigestible themes, which will scare the audience with its slowness and tiring atmosphere.**

there are films that are made for some audiences and not for most people, the general public. this film is one of them: being what it is, it doesn't even try to capture our sympathy or attention. the film did very well on the festivals circuit and even won the palme d'or at cannes, in addition to being acclaimed by critics and intellectuals. however, it was not understood by almost anyone but them, it seems extremely cryptic in its message and script, and it was not able to please the mass audience: the proof is in the fact that it received three oscar nominations without, however, winning any, and not even have been considered by the globes or bafta.

the film revolves around a middle-class texan family between the present and the 1950s, and focuses particularly on the figure of jack, the couple's son. the film shows how he lives his childhood, the unequal relationship he has with his parents (a more tolerant and good mother, and a more authoritarian and disillusioned father) and the way both, each in their own way, they try to prepare and educate him. in between, we observe the way they react to the death of one of the youngest members of the family. the film seeks to relate all this to the search for a meaning for human life, showing us images of the planet's history, and others that refer us to various spiritual and metaphysical meanings. we even got access to the characters' prayers and thoughts.

all of this is very beautiful and interesting, and i even liked the characters because they are believable, genuine, well-built, with a rich psychology and manage to capture the audience's sympathy. the problem is that this audience may not even be able to handle the first half hour of film! when cinema deals with philosophical and spiritual themes, it tends to make very meditative and slow films, which drag on and seem heavier than would be desirable. and this movie didn't even try to get away from that and make something minimally palatable. and as if that wasn't enough, director terrence malick decides to use a non-linear narrative that confuses us even more!

overall, the cast did a very good job, within what was asked of him: brad pitt is a strong actor, who draws fans to the cinema by himself. he seems quite mature and aged in some scenes, but i think the character demanded that from him, as if visually conveying how old and world-weary the character felt. sean penn is just as good at what he does, even if the actor doesn't seem aware of what he's actually doing! young hunter mccracken, at this point, managed to untangle himself just as well and with more of a sense of direction and focus. jessica chastain, for her part, is stunning, and the visual beauty and costumes were particularly sympathetic to her.

on a technical level, the film really deserves to be named as one of the most significant of the year 2011, given its visual and aesthetic quality. the cinematography is some of the best and most beautifully executed i've seen in a long time, and that's all the more remarkable considering that director malick tried to restrict the use of cgi and adopt other more conventional visuals to achieve the same results. we saw something similar in scenes from “the fountain”, a film that came to my mind several times while watching this film, either because of the elaborate visuals or the spiritual and metaphysical theme. i also liked the sets, costumes and props, which were able to accurately recreate the atmosphere of the american middle class of the 1950s. the music and sound effects also do a very good job.",low
2227,"**a perfect example of how disrespect for the past and history can totally annihilate a film, even if it is fiction.**

i really enjoy watching period films. however, my work as a historian gives me some antibodies to these films, for reasons linked to the lack of ability to harmonize creative freedom and strict respect for the historical facts and period customs. so, it was with some curiosity that i decided to see this film. after seeing it, i just wanted to slap director dominic sena and screenwriter bragi schut. none deserve any respect for what has been done here. the film is an insult to historians… even if it is not deliberate!

the script is the film's biggest problem, with a writing that seems to glue together fragments of several different stories: we start with the crusades, we follow two knights in several military episodes and then, somewhat brusquely, they turn their backs on the church (supposedly) and leave, probably for their homeland. it turns out that, on the way, they come across the plague, and there is a woman, supposedly a witch, who was arrested, accused of causing the disease. now, it's up to them the task of escorting the so-called witch to a monastery where some friars will judge her, in the light of a book that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world.

when you make a film with a historical background, at the very least, you should ask for the support of a consultant, someone who really knows history. no one should have the presumptuous arrogance to think they know everything, much less to take the public for an idiot, thinking that they will swallow everything that is shown to them! this film is an authentic case study in cinematic anachronism! how can the production admit the placement of clearly baroque decorative pieces in the midst of a medieval setting? how the hell can characters to disinfect their hands with alcohol if that was something totally unknown to medieval man? since when is there a sea in styria, if that ancient region is an inland part of present-day austria and slovenia? how can characters defect if this military concept simply didn't exist at the time?

and if these small questions seem serious, there is something much worse: the crusades were an entire religious, political and military effort that involved christianity for about 300 years, but that effort had practically ended decades before the black death, and much before the dates that the film uses for the fights where the characters take part. there were, in fact, no serious crusades in the 14th century. the battle of artah, which is shown in the film, took place two hundred years earlier, in 1105. therefore, the film deliberately delayed the crusades two hundred years, in order to almost coincide with the black death, and the characters could participate in both situations! it's absurd! another thing that simply didn't exist in the middle ages was the notion of a witch hunt! of course, for medieval man, the devil was a threat, and of course there was a relationship between diabolical art and the works and studies of many scholars, alchemists or sages who contradicted the religious knowledge. but the so-called witch persecutions only began to be more notable in the 16th century, framed in a clerical response to the reformation and to ideas (all of them) that endangered the dominion that the church had over knowledge!

i pity nicolas cage and ron perlman. they are actors i respect, and seeing them participate in such a poorly made film is quite unfortunate, given that they have talent and are, as far as i've seen, almost the only positive things to highlight. even if everything had been done in a way that respects history, the end of the film is so unbelievably stupid that it would spoil any previous effort. the rest of the cast, except for the two names mentioned, do not stand out in any way.",low
2231,"fate? unknown... 

drive is directed by nicolas winding refn and adapted to screenplay by hossein amini from the novel of the same name written by james sallis. it stars ryan gosling, carey mulligan, bryan cranston, albert brooks, oscar isaac, christina hendricks and ron perlman. music is by cliff martinez and cinematography by newton thomas sigel.

driver (gosling) has a day job, he's a hollywood stunt man, but by night he makes the serious cash as a getaway driver for the criminal fraternity. into his life comes married next door neighbour irene (mulligan) and her little boy benicio (kaden leos), pitching him right into the middle of two wars; one is for his emotional worth, the other with the criminal underworld.

real human being, and a real hero.

they cheered at cannes, it has garnered instant cult classic status as well as gushing critical praise, drive is arguably the biggest surprise of 2011. some would debate that it arrived in a year that was dominated by blockbuster brain drains and pretentious parables, meaning it wouldn't take much for something like drive to find a favourable audience. yet drive is a special movie, the surprise being that it delivers a different film to what the plot synopsis suggests. there would have been many disappointed that it didn't turn out to be something akin to the fast & the furious 19, but as its reputation grows, one likes to think that many also had their senses tingled unexpectedly by refn's western done out in 1980s neo noir attire.

yes, at first glance it looks like a simple story given over to style over substance leanings, where the fact that our laconic protagonist is not prone to dialogue expansion, could lend argumentative weight to those potential dissenters only skimming the surface of the picture. but the material is in excellent hands, with refn, sigel, gosling and co, calmly unravelling amini's stripped down screenplay to reveal a gritty urban fable that's laced with ethereal overtones. a picture where a look means more than any words can express, a subtle holding of hands reveals many layers peeling, and then the serene state of play often gets punctured by bouts of shocking violence, yet always it remains a picture big on intelligence, beating a mighty heart in the process.

propelling the picture forward is the complexity of gosling's driver character. he has no back story for us to work from, and he gives nothing away outside of the tender bond formed with irene and child. he is actually one of many purposeful grey areas (or should that be gris areas?) within the plot structure. we learn just enough to be on his side, a noble but flawed hero battling against fate as he fights for the innocent, he be shane for a modern pot boiling los angeles. helps, too, that he's so cool behind the wheel, where he mines steve mcqueen's effortless charisma. refn delivers magic moments of car play, from the near ten minute opening getaway extended sequence, to a high speed kill or be killed pursuit, when the action flows it really pumps the adrenalin.

gosling is amazing, instantly iconic, soft voice matching his soft blue eyes, toothpick perched between teeth, it's a testament to his acting ability that the requisite homages to iconic characters of movies past never veers into parody territory. it's with the calm moments that he triumphs most, be it watching tv with the boy benicio or just gazing intensely into irene's eyes, gosling has a magnetic quality of some significance. mulligan, too, is wonderful, deftly underplaying irene to work off of gosling to create heart aching tenderness, their chemistry superb. isaac does fine work with the ex-con/husband character that is thankfully not stereotypical, brooks is colm meaney like, thriving on simmering badness, while cranston puts real heart into the role of driver's garage boss, the closest thing the driver has to a pal. the only one dimensional character lands in perlman's court, but perlman is such an ebullient and watchable life force the film survives the character's oafness.

from the opening pink neon credits, accompanied by the synth plink of a retro 80s soundtrack (a soundtrack so memorable it lands in the ears and stays there for days), it's evident that refn is a man who takes his style serious. drive is full of classy (yes arty) passages, fluid camera movements, single takes, non central framing of characters, slow motion unfurls and eye dazzling chopper shots of a neon lighted l.a., the director has an eye for the quality required to cloak his story. he of course is aided considerably by his editor matthew newman, and sigel's photography. the former is dealing in seamless precision, the latter a master of shades (a lift sequence is to, ahem, die for) and colour toning delights. marking this out as a blu-ray essential.

you can name about ten films that drive has been either likened too or put forward as an influence, and refn's work here has been touted as an offspring created by michael mann, walter hill, william friedkin and sergio leone (all viable and all actually high praise indeed). but rest assured, drive is still fresh and exciting, the perfect movie package. refn's masterpiece and one of the best films of 2011. 10/10",high

2234,"drive is a cinematic triumph that delivers an unforgettable ride from beginning to end. while the storyline may seem simple at first, the film's attention to detail and intricacy of world-building truly sets it apart from the rest. every character introduced has a connection to the crime world that is slowly pieced together, creating a puzzle that's both engaging and intriguing. this aspect of the film is truly captivating and highlights the excellent writing.

what's more, the family elements of the movie really shine. ryan gosling delivers an outstanding performance as a protagonist forced to do bad things to survive. however, the connection he forms with the family across the hall is heartwarming, slowly evolving from a romantic interest to a bond of familiarity and care. in the meantime, oscar isaac also gives a remarkable performance as a character initially portrayed as off-putting and egotistical, but whose love for his family slowly emerges as the movie progresses. his character's desire to get out of the criminal life and make good on his past mistakes is admirable and heartbreaking.

as the story unfolds, the movie takes a dramatic turn, introducing graphic violence and jaw-dropping moments that are genuinely wild. it accelerates to full speed, never letting up, and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. the movie's unique 80s aesthetic is also a standout, even though it takes place in modern times. it is visually impressive, especially when combined with the superb cinematography.

overall, drive is a movie that gets so much right and turns a seemingly generic formula into a film that is truly special. its superb storytelling, memorable characters, intense action, and unique style make it a must-watch for any cinephile.

2287,"wow… here i was, thinking i was going to get to see an awesome comic- like film about a group of girls kickin' a whole lotta butt surrounded by mind-bending fantasy scenery.

technically, i was right… but only technically. sucker punch is like chinese food. you can eat three plates and it will still leave you feeling hungry. it's a great deal of empty calories, is basically what i'm saying. substance? nah.

let me just get right into it. what's wrong with sucker punch is the screenplay. not the actors, not the director, just the story. this story revolves around a group of five girls in an institution for the mentally insane, in a fantastical, steampunk-wannabe 1940's (my best guess) setting. they are treated horribly and their lives are miserable, and to cope with it all, the main protagonist babydoll, escapes into her fantasies and in this trance-like state, devises a plan for them all to escape. 

the concept is not bad. it might have even been really exciting, had it not been executed so laughably unrealistic. and by 'unrealistic', i don't mean the fantasies themselves. i'm referring to the fact that these fantasies were so obviously not dreamed up by an actual teenage girl, but rather they look like the perfect fulfillment of the wet wishes of a horny teenage boy. it is very likely that a teenage girl would dream of being able to wield a samurai sword and beat up every monster, dragon and every other kind of bastard who crosses her path. she would dream of coming out of every battle completely unscathed and with every hair on her pretty head still perfectly in place. she would not, however, be doing all of this scantily clad in sexy lingerie wearing fishnet stockings and high heels… i am a girl, with very vivid imagination. trust me on this one. it was, in one word, ridiculous.

another thing that really bothered me was the way these characters were worked out. as obviously miserable as their personal predicaments were, i could not relate to a single one of them. they were all completely 2- dimensional and just flat-out uninteresting. i didn't care about what happened to a single one of them. i don't believe all of the blame for this falls on the actresses (although theirs weren't exactly oscar winning performances...), again, i chalk it up to poor screen writing. the only one who was able to make her character slightly more than moderately interesting, was not even one of 'the girls', it was dr. vera gorski, played by carla gugino. at least she was interesting to watch, and she was even somewhat of a scene-stealer, taking much thunder away from the girls simply because she (both the actress and the character) had the biggest personality. all the others, i felt were mostly just going through the motions, because they had zero character development and no interesting dialogue to work with. and that's bad when you're talking about the characters that are supposed to carry the story. a pleasant (and much needed surprise) came in the form of scott glenn, who only appears in the fantasy segments as several different versions of a wise man. that was a nice touch. 

however, the one thing that really stood out for me as the true axis of failure that sums up sucker punch, was the feeling of total confusion that was present from the beginning and never cleared up. i'm not saying i didn't 'get it', i'm saying it was a hot, incoherent mess. and i usually don't mind being thrown back and forth and to and fro throughout a film, i don't mind playing guessing games and wondering what it will all lead to. i do mind when the roller-coaster ride is over and all i feel is queasy. some people have suggested that this is a really deep and complex film, but honestly, i think they're just reading too much into it. the stupid thing is, for the most part it was completely predictable, and still it lacked structure and decent storytelling. that may seem like a paradox, but there's an easy way to explain it. in the words of the great roger ebert: ""now that's bad filmmaking."" 

the only element in sucker punch that was somewhat redeeming, were the visual effects. i must say, it was all very gorgeous and eye-pleasing. also, the soundtrack was excellent, filled with very well performed covers of well-known songs and some perfectly chosen originals. emily browning, who plays babydoll (and also sings a few songs on the soundtrack), was a good choice for the lead role, but i must say, in all honesty, that was mostly because she was visually very appealing as the main protagonist. more simply put – she was very pretty. still, i'm not sure that's enough to carry a film. 

all in all, i'm left feeling – zack snyder… dude. what were you thinking. you can do so much better than this. i guess i just finally have to come to terms with the fact that everybody's human and is bound to make one big mistake at least once in their lives. zack… this is yours.

hanna is directed by joe wright and written by david farr and seth lochhead. it stars saoirse ronan, eric banna, tom hollander, olivia williams, jason flemyng and cate blanchett. music is by the chemical brothers and cinematography by alwin h. kuchler.

hanna heller (ronan) is a 16 year old highly trained assassin on the run from the cia...

heralded by some british critics as original and thrilling, joe wright's hanna is neither. it's a gimmick movie dressed up as cool for the kids fodder that is both boring and cheesy. taking the gimmick aside, that of a 16 year old crack assassin girl slotting all who come in her way, it starts off promisingly enough as we meet hanna and her father erik (banna) out in the wilderness. there's training, a believable bond (both ronan and banna don't disgrace themselves) and the wintry landscape bites hard as we wonder what is in store.

then the film shifts to hanna being on the run, where the back story guff is just, well, guff, and the pace crawls to a standstill. blanchett's (badly miscast) cia operative is in pursuit, with that back story guff tattooed on her forehead, and it tries to gain momentum for the inevitable showdown between the big bad bitch and the little china doll killer. the chemical brothers drip their brand of techno beats over it, which is ok if you like that sort of thing. how cool?!

in the middle passages hanna rides along with a hippy family, with flemyng also badly miscast, and there's some cack-handed attempt at humanising poor hanna as she comes alive in the big old world. it's derivative in premise, boring in execution and designed to make teenagers think they are watching a masterpiece for their generation.

the amusement park finale is well staged, location photography is pleasing enough in that hip-euro way, and banna and ronan work hard to keep it from total damnation. but for much of the near two hour run time it's a butt numbing bore that has ideas far above its station. joe wright should stick to making keira knightley look good. 4/10",low

it doesn’t help that, when he first appears in the movie, he gets shot down by a simple “human” gun and ends up in hospital. this nonsense about, first trying to hide out in some obscure place a ’la the hulk (been there done that), and then trying to get rid of his powers and afterwards taking on satan without them is just ruining the fun. the film totally lacks the spirit of the first one.

2307,"**it's better to forget this movie.**

as i said before, in the review i wrote for “ghost rider”, i'm not a fan or even an expert in comics, so i'll ignore the source material and focus on the movie. i'm not the right person to say whether or not it's a reliable adaptation. however, i can already say that it is a bad movie. with all its weaknesses, the first film was a work of art when compared to this unfortunate piece.

the biggest problem with this movie is that it's a sequel designed to make money. producers and studios didn't even bother to try to disguise their greed, and rubbed their hands at the good box office obtained. poorly received by critics, the target of numerous criticisms from the public, but a relative success at the box office, the initial film paved the way for this sequel, which wouldn't be bad if it was a good sequel. unfortunately, almost the entire cast and crew of the first film (except for nicolas cage) is absent from this project, which adopts a totally different visual and dramatic language from the previous film and, thus, cuts any hypothetical continuity.

the script is mediocre and is based on a fight between johnny blaze and especially powerful evil forces that want to kidnap a child, supposedly the son of the devil, key-figure to armageddon. simple, extremely clichéd, very poorly crafted and poorly developed, it's a script worthy of a 70's b-movie. all the dense atmosphere and something sinister we saw in the initial film is totally absent, having been replaced by something lighter, ""hard rock"" and eventually designed for young adults and teenagers aspiring to be rockers. the fast pace with which everything happens favors the logical flaws, which appear in the script with the magnificence of baroque palaces, being impossible to ignore them: the case of the monks, with medieval robes and caves coexisting with high-tech devices, weapons that would suffice for ukraine for a year, and wine capable of getting half the russian troops drunk, is one of the most egregious. i'd rather not talk about the ability to decompose objects and food that one of the characters will acquire at the end, and that seem to work only when it's convenient for the film.

nicolas cage is still present in the film, but he is the only one from the previous cast to do so, since all the others, especially eva mendes and peter fonda, dropped out of the project after reading the script. smart decision. cage, if not brilliant in the first film, is mediocre in the sequel, with a one-dimensional, apathetic and sleepy interpretation. ciarán hinds is doing well and doing a great job and very worthy, but he doesn't have much to do, while violante placido and idris elba, despite their efforts and some good moments, don't make more than an average effort.

technically, the film bets massively on cgi, of great visual and dramatic effect, with the flames and the whole apparatus around the rider reaching hyperbolic levels. the mine scenes are perhaps the most obvious example of what i'm saying: enough bullets for a military battle, fire everywhere, that huge machine... everything taken to the extreme for visual grandeur and spectacularity. it sometimes worked, there's no denying it, but it often feels like something out of a computer game. set in an area of ​​central europe, the film was partially shot in romania and makes good use of the beauty of the chosen locations. the sets and costumes are decent given the script and location, and the soundtrack is heavy, tiresome and uninteresting. worse, however, are the sound effects used, as they are often clearly fake.",low
2308,"like the first one, this film can't find its footing. johnny blaze is also kind of dan ketch and the ghost rider spirit is kind of both blaze's and ketch's possessions.

it just doesn't work. it's pulled in two directions in character and because of that it can never find its footing. like the old indian saying ""if you chase two rabbits you'll lose them both""

the franchise would have benefited if they chose one of the stories to tell, one of the ghost riders to portray. pick blaze, pick ketch, it wouldn't have mattered, but two characters as fundamentally different as they are, dealing with two completely different demons meshing them together just loses focus on the story.

and beyond that, what you have left is too much cgi.

2311,"**when the electric mist from the sky struck down.**

this film came five years ago, but i watched it now. a us-russian collaboration product that's entirely takes place in moscow. this is an alien invasion theme, but slightly different than those similar films. it never gives the reason, just the destructions like apocalypse on its way. that means it is about the survival. a group of americans who are in the moscow for different reasons joins the hands after people started to turn into ashes with the contact of the strange electric mist that came from the sky. so what's their plan now and whether they get out of it safely or not focused on the remaining film.

surely some people would enjoy it. it's not all bad if you are not expecting a masterpiece. i should have seen it in digital 3d for a better experience, even the normal watch is not that bad. the turns in the story were unpredictable, particularly the film characters, but the twist wasn't. they kept the open ending, and you know why is that. i liked the performances, not individually, but the overall everyone, including the russians.

the film was also shorter, which means fast moving tale. the graphics were okay, especially those electric mist thing, but disappointed for not show the aliens other than for fractions of seconds during the fightbacks. despite enjoyed watching it, i'm not in favour of it, because it's just one of those films that falls in the average category where the majority of those who watched it not happy for not detailing everything in the film.

_4/10_",low
2312,"**good cgi, good action scenes, good sound, moscow is an interesting place, but everything else is so weak and stupid that it's not worth watching this movie twice.**

i decided to watch this film yesterday, when it was shown on tv, but curiously i was waiting to see another film with a similar title made in 2017. even so, i didn't give up my time: even though i didn't have much predilection for alien invasion films, the film is quite dynamic, has good action scenes and a good amount of high quality cgi, and so it is, at least, a piece of entertainment that we don't regret watching... once. just once.

let's start with the good stuff: the scenes take place in moscow, the russian megalopolis, long before we ostracized the country due to aggression against neighboring ukraine, when russians seemed to want to have more contact with westerners. this was a real breath of fresh air because in sci-fi films we almost only see us cities. i also believe that filming in russia was a strategic option for the production to be able to film at lower costs. in addition to the clever use of the filming locations (which include red square and the gum shopping center), the film offers us a massive dose of high-quality cgi, which we see in greater glory when the aliens appear. but the whole film is a feast of cgi and visual effects. the sound effects are also very good, and the action and running scenes are fun enough to keep the film moving.

and unfortunately, good things end here. everything else is so full of flaws and problems that make the film unworthy of a second chance. this is just my opinion, but i think we can all agree on one point: there are a lot of films about alien invasions, and it doesn't take much thinking to remember two or three that make this film a total joke.

the film is directed by chris gorak, but it seems like he was more fascinated with cgi and action than trying to direct. thus, we have a very young cast who are left to their own devices and who interpret the characters according to what seems most appropriate to them. emile hirsch did an excellent work in “into the wild” just before this, but he had a solid character and was well directed. here, he has none: the result is a tepid, vague, lifeless interpretation without any personality. his partner max minghella, who had just done “the social network”, was not a good choice for his character. he is one of those actors who is “always the bridesmaid and never the bride”, so to speak: his lack of presence and charisma put him far from the main roles, although he is an option for supporting cast. joel kinnaman is stupidly weak as the villain: he behaves like a high school bully, and his character is as thin as paper. olivia thirlby also does little for the film, with a character who merely looks sexy, and who we expect to see kissing one of the boys at some point. worse luck was rachael taylor, who is irritating to the point that we say hallelujah when her character finally dies. and the russian cast? i don't know any of the actors, but i even liked veronika vernadskaya a little. unfortunately, the russian cast seems to be there only for us to see the russians as perpetual badasses, a ""rambo nation"" on horseback with machine guns. putin certainly enjoyed seeing this in a western film.

as bad as the cast and their performance, the script copies moments and elements from several sci-fi films (“cloverfield”, for example) to create a story where there is no logical sense or real threat. it's truly unfortunate that, with such good cgi and such well-chosen filming locations, the film is unable to cause a single shiver of tension in the audience. in addition to a rather weak story, there are several moments in which the film seems to be mocking our intelligence: moscow is one of the most densely populated places in the world: it makes sense that, even after the city is devastated in the first attack, there are only five or six people wandering the streets? seeing a commercial plane crashed in a shopping center is sensational, but where did its wings end up? and why is there no fire, debris or explosions resulting from the collision? the film ends with a nuclear submarine setting sail from the moscow river. however, you don't need to be a muscovite or even a russian to see that this watercourse doesn't have the depth or width to maneuver such a big thing! to think that the public will believe this things is insulting.",low

i was intrigued by moneyball, synopsis tantalisingly offering up a sports success story based on an improbable blend of maths (something i hate with a passion), guile and perceived misfits as a team. sure enough, after viewing moneyball it has landed joyously onto a personal favourites list.

unsurprisingly, when digging into the actual facts of the oakland athletics 2002 season at the core of the story, i found truths stretched, some character portrayals toyed with, and omissions to round out a better story. but crucially, the key element here is the moulding of a team for what in baseball parlance is financial peanuts. this makes their 20 game wining run as being an outstanding achievement.

the mathematical aspects of the story are easily explained via the interactions of general manager billy beane (brad pitt) and his economics right hand man peter brand (jonah hill). baseball operations behind the scenes are given fascinating clarity via the tremendous screenplay (steven zaillian and aaron sorkin). and ultimately the blend of on field action, family relationships and team assembling flows beautifully as one.

jesus christ. what just happened to my brain?

i was worried that _cabin in the woods_ was gonna be a letdown, ‘cause i had built it up so much in my head, and it seemed such a ridiculous concept that it would have been nearly impossible to pull off flawlessly. and maybe it won’t go to join the ranks of my favourite films in existence, but it was… so. fucking. good.

drew goddard (who wrote _cloverfield_) is no stranger to working with joss whedon (_buffy the vampire slayer, the avengers_) and my god do they ever make a team. joss whedon is my unopposed all-time favourite person involved in the film industry in any way, shape, or form. which is quite the claim, given my interests. he’s had a couple of fuck ups, and been fucked around a few times too, but all in all, nobody captures me quite the way he does.

i’ll try and aim for not-spoilers, if you watch the trailer you’ll get that this isn’t a typical horror movie. you’ll also pick up on that if you watch the first 5 minutes of the damn thing. i won’t go into the finer details, but let me just reiterate, it is not a slasher film. there’s a fair amount of horror, some action, some sci-fi, a bit of fantasy, some short but sweet comedy, a bunch of thriller, a little monster-movie, a bit of homage and a healthy (but not overdone) dose of parody. joss whedon tends to do that, his work is usually less in the horror genre and more in the… genre genre. if that makes sense.

i seem to recall it performing kind of averagely at the box office, but critical reception was fantastic. and rightfully so. and fan-aimed movies as good as this always manage to fall into their cult, so there’s a pretty avid group of people who are super keen on it, too. again, rightly so. i think the best (as well as most important) thing about _cabin in the woods_, is that it pumps some new blood into horror. sure, it wasn’t 100% original, but then it never claimed to be. at least it wasn’t a sequel or another bloody remake.

seriously, i hate on remakes much, much less than most, but come on people! this is all rather ridiculous. imagine if the wachowskis had said “hey, we’ve got this great idea for a dystopian, industrial sci-fi type thing called _the matrix_… actually, you know what? that sounds like an awful lot of effort. let’s do an over the top american remake of _the castle_ instead!” yeah, sounds like a great world to live in. fuckin’… lazy ‘n shit…

lost track there, anyway! _cabin in the woods_! fuck! good! watch that shit! make up your own mind of course, but i really dig it. there’s something to be said for being fucked up and going with it. i’m sure some people will dismiss _cabin_ entirely, because it’s so out there. and i’m sure even more people will get pissy about the ending. but if you have no expectations, and just try enjoy the ride, then i think you damn well might.

2352,"**it has quality, it has several interesting points to observe, but it has a stupid humor that is completely lost by the message it conveys about drugs and sex.**

i saw this movie on television by mere chance, just now, and i confess that i didn't like it. it is in fact a light film, it has some good scenes and moments, it even has several quality points as i will discriminate, but if we think about it, its style of humor, based almost entirely on jokes about sex, use of all kinds of drugs and such, spoils everything. i know there are people who like these easy laugh comedies, but i'm far from being one of them.

kal penn and john cho give life to the main characters, who they already know very well because it is the third film in this franchise (which i haven't seen and, after this, i won't see it). the film also introduces us to danny trejo, paula garcés, richard riehle and danneel ackles, to name just a few supporting actors in this film. the actors are doing what they can with the material at hand, i think that's one of the redeeming values of this film, but there's not much they can do when the material is intentionally bad and still makes money.

on a technical level, what i liked the most were the stop-motion animations that appear in a given situation in which the protagonists are stoned. it was a quality asset, and using it was creative and original, even though the film isn't worth our time and money. the settings are also good, especially cho's house, overloaded with decorations and christmas lights to the point of being cheesy, thus evidencing the lack of taste of its owner, a drug addict of korean descent who simply gets rich. the soundtrack also deserves a positive note, if only for its work with the classic songs of the season.

as you can see, the film had the potential to be very interesting and was only lost by its lewd humor, the vile, absolutely despicable jokes, and the film's total obsession with sex and drugs. what was the target audience for this crap? drug addicts and sex maniacs? a bunch of teenagers without any brains to think? let's be honest: on the one hand, the film conveys the idea that harold and kumar (the junkies on duty, that is, the main characters) are totally irresponsible, immature and unworthy of being considered for a serious matter. this is a positive message because indeed drug users and sex addicts are despicable, irresponsible, unworthy of being considered mature or trustworthy. and i emphasize: marijuana, whatever the name you want to give it, is a drug and its consumption is addictive and leads to crime and death. it's an addiction like any other. however, on the other hand, and despite the fact that the film gives us this positive message, it also makes an apology for consumption! what do we see? people who have fun and laugh when they're high, even if they do stupid things! but drugs are like alcohol and all other addictions: at that moment it seems like a good idea, but in exchange for these moments, we sell our soul.",low

2356,"on imdb, x-men: first class has garnered the highest rating of all films in the x-men franchise so far. given the fact that this film features only a few of the familiar characters of the previous films, portrayed by different, younger actors, and the complete absence of wolverine, the (current) rating of 8.1 somewhat surprised me. that was before i had seen it...

being a pretty big x-men fan myself, i was excited to see this, regardless of plot or characters. however, i was also a little wary of what to expect, for the reasons stated above. i suspect that anybody reading this might feel the same way. but rest assured, any doubts were quickly dispelled no later than the opening scene. first class starts off very well, with the exact same opening scene as the first x-men, featuring a young erik lehnsherr being separated from his parents in a nazi concentration camp. what follows after this familiar story is something completely new and particularly dark and brutal. i won't give away any important plot lines, but suffice it to say there won't be a single person left wondering why magneto is so resentful of ""normal"" people. this event also sets the tone for the rest of the film, and, to a great extent, explains why first class is such a success: this film is all about character. whereas all the other films were mostly about cool superheroes and special effects, first class is all about character development and the history of those who would later become professor x and magneto. this concept might have failed big time if it wasn't for the superb screenplay. i take my hat off to whoever managed to incorporate every little, but crucial, character and storyline and made it flow together so beautifully. literally everything comes together in this film, everything you might have wondered (why is xavier paralyzed?) is given a credible and fitting explanation. 

another real strength of fc is its cast. everybody in this film is right where they should be. kevin bacon is the perfect villain (but we already knew that…), james mcavoy not only looks, but sounds and moves like the young charles xavier would. jennifer lawrence is a convincing, young (and believe it or not, insecure) mystique. all other characters are perfectly cast as well, humans and mutants alike. however, i feel that most credit is due to michael fassbender, an actor i am now ashamed to say i had never even heard of before. the way he portrays the 30-something erik lehnsherr/magneto is stunning. his entire physique, down to every little twitch in his face, truly captivates all the pain and agony erik has had to endure throughout his life. it makes you sympathize with magneto and understand why he is the way he is. whereas the ""old"" magneto was little more than a bitter old man who despised homo sapiens for undisclosed reasons (with no discredit to ian mckellen intended here), michael fassbender does something i thought was almost impossible in a superhero flick: he gives magneto a soul.

in case i might have given the impression that x-men: first class is no more than some wishy-washy character drama, don't worry. there are plenty of awesome action sequences and special effects to keep the more adrenaline-pumped movie-goer satisfied. and before i forget: there are two small, but awesome cameo appearances which i know you will enjoy… 

finally, a small note on parental guidance: i was absolutely baffled to see that half of the audience consisted of parents with small children. like i said before, this is not just another cool superhero movie. x-men: first class features elements which are quite dark and graphic, and especially the scenes portraying nazi brutality are not intended for a young audience. personally, i would say 14 is the appropriate minimum age. 

with all that said, i would recommend this film to anyone, even to those of you who aren't x-men fans. it doesn't happen very often that i can't find a single flaw in a film, but i guess this is just one of those rare cases. great directing, great acting, great everything. period.

2364,"warrior was the most exciting, detailed and emotional movie i saw. it had action, drama & descent cast.

it dwelve into the backstory for each character:
brendan resented his father for being an abusive alcoholic, and made a life for himself and his family. he cares for his family too much to let them lose their home, and so he goes back to mma sport to win a few money. but circumstances had gave brendan the oppertunity to win big at the sparta tournament. once there, mhe comes face to face with his brother.
tommy is another side of the coin; he has so much anger in him; he blames his father for the past and blames his brother for abandoning him and their dying mother. but he made a new family in the marine corp, for which he enlisted, particuraly one marine who called brother, who was killed in a friendly fire. tommy then desserted his regiment and decided to enter the sparta tournament to win a prize money as a promise to his friend's family (this shows that he does have a kinder side, even for a biref moment). he turns to his father to train him, but still resenting him for the past. but near the end, he sees his father relapsed and drunk (as drunk as he was in the past) and seeing how sad it all looks, tommy realised he wasted all that anger over a broken down drunk and (may implied) forgave him (which was a sweet moment).
paddy is the father to brendan and tommy, but he lost them both (and his wife) when he was an abusive alcoholic. he regretted his actions and went sober. he tries yet fails to reconcile with both sons for the past. while brendan had fogiven him (but don't trust him), tommy still held that anger. eventually, paddy became heartbroken that tommy will never forgive him and so he relapsed and got drunk. this inadvertantly changed tommy's perspective his of father. in the end, paddy looked on with pride as his sons reconciled.

i really liked the ending of the film, where the two brothers, tommy and brendan, went face-to-face. and right near the end, it was really emotional, when the brothers finally let go of the past.

blitz parades its dreadful lack of logic and experience, making its short runtime feel much too long. the writing chases side plots and rabbit trails that lead nowhere despite an effort to tie it all together later in the film. the result is a distracted storyline with awful pacing. the score and soundtrack didn’t help either, as grunge rock music punctuates every action scene. the one part of this movie that shines is the casting with several big actors that have significantly risen since their time in this film, including an oscar winner. unfortunately, the horrible directing overshadowed its cast’s great skill. i am a major statham fan but not a fan of this movie at all.",low

the plot is a very standard and unoriginal one about agent getting double-crossed and subsequently deals out some pay-back. i have no problem with that. it is a valid setting for some nice action. the problem lies in the implementation.

the acting is never anything to write home about. you get the feeling all the characters are just reading of the script in order to get the scenes done and over with. as a consequence you never really get any attachment to neither the heroine nor the bad guys. most of the movie i just sat and waited for the next action scene to begin. there are quite a few good names in this movie but, sadly, none of them are really allowed to “take the stage” and give any real performance.

2428,"when i first saw another earth several years ago i thought that, like some science fiction out there, it was light on the science and heavy on fiction. fantasy, maybe. i was okay with that as long as the story and characters were strong. besides, nowadays it seems like many mainstream physicists are seriously promoting the ideas around multiple universes or perhaps even an infinite number of alternate universes, perhaps science is catching up with the fiction. (though i still think a planet popping into our galaxy so close to us would cause cataclysmic tides and whatnot.) . in any case, i recently bought and downloaded a digital version of it to watch it again.

but another earth isn’t about physics or science or what would become of humanity if a twin earth and moon suddenly showed up in our sky. it is about a heart-stopping event that cause a planet full of people to stop what they are doing and look up and wonder. is that earth different than ours? am i up there, and if so, is that version exactly like me or have they made different decisions that affect who they have become? could i have made different decisions, or was this version of me locked into what i decided and thought? and in the case of our lead character, rhoda, it leads her to a path to seek forgiveness and try to make up for a tragic mistake she made a couple of years earlier, actually on the day the second earth appeared.

so i will say no more about the plot, let alone the surprising little twist deep in the movie. you really feel for these characters. they seem real and you care about them. kumamoto pallana steals the scenes he is involved with. because of the internal turmoil and the questions rhoda is asking herself, even ordinary interactions with other characters feel imbued with deeper meaning. as a side note, it was written by the woman who plays rhoda.

director soderbergh is intelligent enough to really make this material work, going at it from every conceivable angle (and many inconceivable ones!) yet still giving it coherence in a decent runtime (not a bay-esque three hours) and there's enough star power to keep one's attention. the best kind of review for these sort of films is that it leaves you thinking twice before you have an affair, or even throw out your kleenex, and that's specifically what soderbergh's work here does.",high
2449,"i am amazed by how many people on imdb that have given this movie 8, 9 and even 10 stars. it’s perhaps not the worst movie i’ve seen but it is in no way worth that kind of rating.

the good part of the movie is liam neeson who makes an enjoyable performance with the script that he was given. he is pretty much the reason that i gave it as much as 4 imdb stars. the rest of the film is just plain wrong.

my first impression is, god this director likes film grain! now this is a matter of taste of course but i don’t like when movies have artificially been made to look like they were filmed on old and crappy film. it has its places but it didn’t add anything here.

the film starts off with a plane crash which is not done very good. neither in terms of special effects nor in terms of realism.

the lack of realism, unfortunately, continues throughout the movie. the behavior of the wolves is utterly unnatural and unrealistic. i can live with this if it’s a horror movie or some other fantasy movie but this is not supposed to be that. the actual footage of the wolves is rather mediocre as well.

then there is this so called experienced hunter and “wolf expert”. leaving the crash site is a dubious decision to say the least. then we got the jumping of cliffs with a flimsy home made rope instead of just walking a bit further to get down not to mention making ammunition go off by poking wooden sticks at it, what the f…? in addition the guy knows nothing about wolves, or any other wild animal for that matter.

just to add to this not so enjoyable experience, the film has an utterly lousy ending.",low
2452,"**glenn close shone in one of the most interesting films she's made in recent years.**

glenn close is undoubtedly a great actress, with a lot of credit, even if she has terrible bad luck at the oscars, with eight nominations and eight letdowns. i've seen several works that she really puts a lot of effort into, and this film is just one more. she had already played the same character on broadway before, but this time in addition to being an actress, she was still dedicated to scriptwriting, production and other details. so, the film entirely bears the imprint of this great artist.

based on a fictional text, the film introduces us to a mature woman who, after a life of difficulties, decided to hide her gender and disguise herself as a man in order to work. so, albert nobbs is a shy and withdrawn woman who never lived a full life because of this lie. her dream is to save enough to start her own business. he finally meets someone in a similar situation to her and gains the courage to woo helen dawes, a chambermaid at the same hotel where he works... but she's not entirely genuine in the way she lets herself be wooed. she has a boyfriend who is interested in nobbs' savings.

the film has an excellent initial premise and that works very well, but the truth is that the characters are too dense for a film that i would classify as a “light drama” given the inability to create a more tense and more serious atmosphere. to make things more difficult, the film is extremely slow and most of the characters don't evoke any sympathy, and they weren't particularly well-thought-out.

the strongest point of the whole film is close's enormous multipurpose exercise, who writes a song for the film, helps with the script, produces and still acts wonderfully. she gives nobbs a typically british composure and sheer shyness that i thought suited the character. mia wasilowska does what she can and makes the most of her beauty and charm, but the character seems shallow and uninteresting. aaron johnson doesn't look bad to me either, but the truth is that he, like pauline collins and janet mcteer, had almost no screen time. they are actors who have been set aside.

technically, the film has low-key production values ​​and successfully seeks to set its story in the dublin city of the late 19th century. the props, costumes and sets are what you would expect in a good movie. cinematography is average, editing is not very good, dialogue is decent but not particularly good. the soundtrack has moments of quality and a lot of inspiration.",low

except in j. edgar where, for the first real time, dicaprio doesn't look like dicaprio, he looks a lot like the cross-dressing fascist he's portraying.

and being leo, he acts like him too.

thank you. for once the studio didn't bank on his face and it paid out.

so we not only get to see leo acting the part, but for the first time we get to really see him looking the part too and the last time he did that was in ""what's eating gilbert grape."" and on top of it all we have clint eastwood directing and, honestly, not a fan of him as an actor, love him as a director.

given his politics i walked in thinking right wing love story...i walked out with ""honest depiction"" and that helps a lot.

not only does that help, but the scandal around hoover's sexuality was done appropriately, that is to say it didn't take center stage, j. edgar did...and, as i said, you were watching j. edgar and not leo doing his best to be the man while having to still look like himself.

it's just a win all around...except it could have benefited for time. trim it down a bit. i know he's hugely important to history and eastwood is a great director with a great cast but...it got a bit long in the tooth at places and that hurt the flow of the film.",high

a retired cia operative is paired with a young fbi agent to hopefully solve the case of a serial killer whose style of killings point to a soviet operative long thought dead.

in amongst the plot holes and ridiculous resolutions there's a more than competent cold war political murder mystery trying to get out. unfortunately first time director and co-writer michael brandt thinks he's john le carré and in his attempts to be clever and tricky for the final third of pic, he just comes off as an amateur who is insulting his audience.

initially the pic is on safe footings. ok! so it's conventional in formula, but the intrigue is there, richard gere and topher grace in the lead roles have our attention, and a turn of events at the 30 minute mark has us firmly in the story's grip. sadly it never materialises into the top line suspense thriller the makers clearly were aiming for.

as the narrative spins into a muddled mess, brandt is forced to rely on a couple of livewire sequences to save the day; cue interrogation machismo and some car crash chaseville, but it's never enough to save the day. more so when martin sheen wanders back into the fold, it is here when you realise you have forgotten he was in the pic anyway! that pretty much says it all. 4/10",low

super 8 is written and directed by j. j. abrams. it stars joel courtney, elle fanning, kyle chandler, ron eldard and riley griffiths. music is scored by michael giacchino and cinematography by larry fong. the film tells the story of a group of young teenagers in lillian, ohio, 1979, who are filming their own super 8 zombie movie when a train derails and crashes, releasing an unknown being into their midst. as the town is threatened and mysteries start to mount up, the youngsters must come to terms with not only that, but also growing up mentally and physically.

it's feels nigh on impossible to come across a review for super 8 that doesn't contain the name spielberg. with the film overtly spiebergian in themes and production, and the bearded maestro of the film geek masses on producer duties here, his name hangs over abrams' movie like a watchful father figure. if that bothers abrams, or indeed if it detracts from the quality of his movie? then that's up for debate by those not enamoured with spielberg's movies of the late 70s and early 80s. but to my mind it's a blessing, a triumph of sorts to be mentioned in the same breath as the beard and those wonderful movies of his. part homage, part nostalgia harking, super 8 is still one great, sweet and affecting j.j. abrams movie.

abrams himself is on record as saying that super 8 is born out of two movie ideas he had, this while also being drawn from his own recollections in childhood, and the two movie idea shows. it's very much a two part picture in structure, part stand by me coming of ager, part goonie like monster hunt. nothing wrong with that, mind. however, with that comes some form of irritation to those who venture in expecting a big ole alien attack movie. oh for sure he exists, and he is big and mean, although he has just cause, but the creature is not the centre piece of the movie. it's the human characters that form the basis of super 8, be it the kids adjusting to their changing emotions and hormones, or the single parent fathers coming to terms with absence of love and grief, super 8 is brimming with human heart. yet never is it schmaltzy.

production value!

aided by fong's warm metallic hued photography and giacchino's beautiful heart tugging score (both energised in blu-ray), super 8 always carries a magical mysticism to it. the warm glow of nostalgia cloaks the proceedings, never cloying, always smile inducing, offering comfort as the narrative deals out observations about the need to let go while playing out as a deft, if unsubtle, meditation on grief and growing pains. the cast do wonders for their director, fanning and courtney are exemplary, so much raw emotion and energy, it's unfussy and believable acting. griffith's, too, is wonderful as the booming voiced wannabe director, a tender nod of the head to the many young amateur directors out there; of which abrams was once one himself. while eldard and chandler as the two fathers are most affecting, the pangs of juggling single parenting with loss are deeply portrayed.

of the director himself? he crafts it with care and precision, a knowing of the pulse beat of the thematics to drive it forward. his attention to period details are admirable, from the dialogue sparks involving walkman's and soviet paranoia, to the items located within the bedrooms and houses of our young protagonists, he is a man who knows his late 70s and early 80s onions. spielberg was far from finished as a film maker of note at the time of super 8's release, but it did feel then that the torch was deftly being passed sideways. after the excellence of star trek he followed up with this most delightful of movies, where abrams showed in his work a love of cinema that's wholly infectious. 9/10",high

it seems to merge genres slightly: science fiction, of course, a bit of coming of age, a slice of movie-within-a-movie - is that all?  
 
i think i have watched this movie three times, and probably will again. it reminds me of monsters, another low key sci-fi/monster movie i really like. the train scene about twenty minutes into super 8 is a blockbuster scene, so much so that i believe most movies wouldn't be able to keep the rest of the film from being anti-climactic. usually a tremendous scene like that is saved for the end of a movie, but the plot required to be right where it was. but although the action and suspense ramps down a bit following it, the movie goes to work on building up the rest of the plot and growing the characters.

the young actors starring in this movie are terrific, in my opinion, which may place me in an unfortunate minority. but judge for yourself, and try not to set the bar of excellence higher than we do for adult actors. they are smart and witty at times, but are clearly kids with kid behavior at other times, rather than miniature adults with adult lines.

anees basmee is very well known for his bollywood comedies, very often about marital problems, in the french tradition of french theater author vaudeville (his name was used for the genre later). i usually only mildly like his movies, but this one is more cunning in making the cheating husbands ridiculous and guilty. the first part is more of kishand trying to find proof of the guilt of the three, then it's more revenge of the wives for their husband's disloyalty.

what's great in this one is that the wives are really more than angry shrews, they are really affected by the deception, and have their own reactions. the cast is doing a phenomenal job, akshay as the cunning guy that gets moved by these cheated wives, the three friends trying to save the appearances by using stupid lies that put them in miserable situations, and the wives having very realistic emotions for the situation.

synopsis: (from google)
successful and handsome new yorker brandon (michael fassbender) seems to live an ordinary life, but he hides a terrible secret behind his mask of normalcy: brandon is a sex addict. his constant need for gratification numbs him to just about everything else. but, when sissy (carey mulligan), brandon's needy sister, unexpectedly blows into town, crashes at his apartment and invades his privacy, brandon is finally forced to confront his addiction head-on. 

review:

i'm certain shame will always be my personal favorite mcqueen film. mcqueen tells a story with the camera and with the voice. 

mcqueen brought on sean bobbitt as cinematographer for this amazing project and bobbitt does not disappoint. together they craft some of the most revealing and beautiful scenes in recent cinema. the lighting for this movie (also headed by bobbitt), aids in the visual storytelling.

abi morgan and mcqueen's script really shines, bringing brandon's addiction further into the light. 

harry escott's haunting score will never leave your brain after you see this film. escott's use of both classical and original pieces bring the film together.

michael fassbender gives a stunning performance as brandon, one moment he's casually strolling about, the next he's acting on his most basic impulses, and the next he's yelling at his sister. carey mulligan gave a great supporting role next to fassbender as well. both are given several scenes to shine.

the film uses its nc-17 rating to its fullest extent, yet none of the sex feels sensationalized. it's all very real and most of the time almost disturbing to watch. mcqueen delivers the entire story very artistically, including the sex scenes, which many directors could have messed up. this makes the film as a whole flow better. the movie portrays sex addiction (and addiction in general) in a very real way, while everyone is different we all feel shame after we've gotten our fix, and sometimes we'll do anything to get that fix.",high

filmed in texas in under three weeks, killer joe is a film that walks the fine line of misogyny and perversity for perversity's sake. but it never falls over that mark, even though these are scummy characters living in a scummy world, where there's sex and violence, and violent simulated sex and nudity; all of which is cloaked by a sweaty crime gone wrong caper. much of the film is dialogue driven, rest assured this is very talky, but the director wrings out much tension and salaciousness from every character interaction, the slow-burn approach only heightening the sense of dread. when the finale comes, and it's a cracker-jack ending, there's an almost merciful release that it's all over. these are people you wouldn't want to hang out with ever, only there's friedkin chuckling away to himself having made us spend an hour and forty minutes with this grime laden crew. if you feel like you need a bath afterwards, that's perfectly natural.

friedkin has garnered terrific performances from a top line cast. hirsch (powder-keg), church (naievity extraordinaire), temple (virginal piggy in the middle) and gershon (bold and suspicious), are all giving disturbing credibility to the material, but as good as they are they are trumped considerably by mcconaughey. one of the most frustrating actors working today, much like cage, a ream of poor movies adorn his cv, but once in a while he throws in a performance of such genuine quality that it begs to be acknowledged by his peers. here as killer joe he lays on a faust like menace, delivering his lines with clinically calm precision, yet still there's a glint in his eye, we know a black heart beats there but he can charm a snake out of its basket, a girl out of her underwear...

the cast is excellent: daniel day-lewis is really impressive as president lincoln. lincoln is believable, human, showing several sides of his personality. he is at times funny, wise, empathetic, coarse, tortured and — well, everything i would expect after reading so much about him over the years.

for me, the movie lost a little of its energy when it shifted to the political maneuvers undertaken concerning the obtaining of votes to pass the amendment lincoln wants to push through congress, but it is integral to the plot, illustrating that lincoln was pragmatic and willing to play the game to achieve his goals. because he narrowed the scope of this lincoln biopic to the last months of the great president’s life, spielberg was able to cover a lot of ground, and explore the issue of slavery and the war from numerous perspectives.

a young man who survives a disaster at sea is hurtled into an epic journey of adventure and discovery. while cast away, he forms an unexpected connection with another survivor: a fearsome bengal tiger.

i did not have huge expectations on this movie since it is not exactly my style of movie but nevertheless i have to say that i was disappointed. the movie is certainly quite beautiful to watch, at least part of it. however it is also a movie with a strong theistic agenda. even though it is, luckily, not really religious/political extremism it is thick and intruding nonetheless. i was expecting pi to actually learn something during the course of his adventure but he does not. he starts the movie gullible and foolish looking for meaning in life (religion) and the movie ends pretty much in the same way with him claiming that he had faith and therefore he survived. yet none of the decisions he made was based on faith but simply pragmatical decisions of survival. if anything the movie proved that faith or religion had nothing to do with it.

as i said the movie was, partly, quite beautiful to watch and this is entirely what rendered it the stars that i gave it. for the rest it was a very boring movie. the only mildly entertaining part was the scenes on the boat with gérard depardieu playing the very unpleasant cook. as beautiful to watch as they were many of the scenes were quite unrealistic though and had an artificial look to them even when, i believe, it was not intended. we bought the movie because my youngest daughter loves movies about animals but not even she was overly entertained by this movie.",low

this movie has the ring of a simple action movie with a small twist. the twist, actually, is quite obvious if you think about what is happening in the beginning of the movie.

i remember seeing the trailer a long time ago, and it painted a picture of a comedy, but this movie is not that. it might have one or two funny fight scenes (and dialogue with robert duvall), but it is actually quite dark. this is kinda what saved the movie a bit for me, having judged it beforehand.

tom cruise is... tom cruise. at least in the way that we have seen him protrayed in the most recent years. the silent, cool guy who knows how to handle the problems, and who seems to always be one step ahead of everyone. i am not a big fan of this guy, and therefore, ultimately, not a big fan of jack reacher, however, it is slightly better than i thought it would be. and werner herzog has a nice little cameo, that movie aficionados will surely enjoy, being the great director that he is.

my new favourite marvel cinematic universe film, undoubtedly! order goes thusly;

1. the avengers
2. iron man
3. thor
4. captain america
5. iron man 2
6. the incredible hulk

i had the privilege of going to sydney and watching this almost a full three weeks before it’s american release, in a special advance screening for fans and a handful of critics. i drove up and back on a day trip with my mate hrv, spent over $400 between us… so worth it.

i think perhaps my expectations of the avengers were too high. in fact i know they were, even so, i feel that it almost managed to meet them. all but two of the fears i had about this epic were quashed without a doubt. i initially was worried about mark ruffalo helming the role of the hulk/bruce banner after taking over from edward norton who was ousted after his first appearance. my complaints were completely unfounded however, as mark ruffalo presents us with an at least as good marvel hero. 

in terms of entertainment, the avengers is one of the greatest feats ever produced. at the screening i went to, i actually missed more than a couple of lines due to the fact that the entire bloody cinema was in hysterics from some classic joss whedon (director - buffy, angel, firefly, dollhouse) humour. the squabbles between these larger than life characters are not quite up to the peak that jon favreau’s iron man & iron man 2 sit on, but in terms of film in general, they are some of the better interactions i’ve ever seen.

the only weak points i really have to whinge about are both quite minor, and perhaps can be rectified in the mcu future. firstly, thor’s return to earth (whilst brilliantly dramatic and pretty) was quite weak in terms of exposition. that said, this isn’t a thor movie, so we don’t need to know everything that happens to him. also, in next year’s thor 2, it is very possible we’ll discover more specific details about the first few scenes of his return. secondly, loki’s army also came across to me quite weakly. in case we have any marvel aficionados in the crowd, i won’t spoil it by telling you who they’re supposed to be, but in general the whole army was essentially a meat shield used to bump out scenes in which the avengers get to kick ass. a very enjoyable part of the film, but one that doesn’t really drive the story at all.

i feel the only way i can adequately describe just how much you need to see this movie (in cinemas) is this: for those of you who understand me, you will be know and be aware of just how much i fucking hate the concept of blu-ray. i am going to buy a blu-ray player, a hd television, and blu-ray discs, just so that i will get more special features when the avengers is released. never have i even considered doing such a thing before.

the avengers doesn’t get into your mind and rape it in the best way possible like revolver or donnie darko. it doesn’t get into your guts and turn them with nostalgic violence like the brilliance in doomsday or outpost. it gets into your heart, and leaves you not just wanting, but needing more. long live the mcu!

2551,"i give this 10 stars based on it being not only better than the trailer and the hype made me thing it would be, but also that it was the first time anything the size and scope of the marvel cinematic universe was pulled off successfully. having joss direct this movie lives and dies on character interaction. this movie is on the definitive list in my opinion even just for that.",high
2552,"everything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old fashioned.

the avengers (aka: avengers assemble) is written and directed by joss whedon, with zak penn co-writing the story. it stars robert downey junior, chris evans, mark ruffalo, chris hemsworth, scarlett johansson, jeremy renner, tom hiddlestone, clark gregg, samuel l. jackson, cobie smulders and stellan skarsgard. music is scored by alan silvestri and cinematography by seamus mcgarvey.

asgardian outcast loki (hiddlestone) has struck a deal with the chitauri to exchange the tesseract for an army with which he can attack earth and thus control it. with the earth in mortal danger, s.h.i.e.l.d director nick fury (jackson) activates the avengers initiative; a collection of super heroes and deadly assassins who, if they can actually come together as one united force, hold the fate of the earth in their hands.

i have no real frame of reference with the avengers comic book world, when i was young i read a bit of spidey, batman and was kind of partial to the fantastic four, but i really don't remember story lines and gave up reading that sort of stuff once sport and exams came into my life. i love movies and as i enter the later stages of my forties i'm pleased to say i have a wide range of film genre interests. i have very much enjoyed the avengers solo films so far, with the exception of iron man 2 which quite frankly is average at best, but the reality is that if the avengers failed as a movie, that whedon got it so wrong, then i wouldn't be foaming at the mouth or proclaiming that the director be stripped naked and whipped around the streets of hollywood! as it is, with one or two minor irks aside, the avengers is about as much fun as i have had with a movie in quite a few years.

i wouldn't know if the makers got the essence right, or if the story is at one in the marvel avengers universe, i just know that it is a right old blast and made a colossal amount of money at the box office, even trumping the dark knight rises in that department. it's a film full of derring-do heroics, ripe witticisms, wonderfully staged action, simmering sexual tensions, ego collisions, charm, heart and splendid human interactions. it looks fabulous on blu-ray, the art design, the colour photography and silvestri's score rumbles like thunder and crackles like lightning, just as a super hero movie score should do. the cast performances are hugely enjoyable as they bounce off of one and other, feeding off the respective thespian energy with a knowing of the right tone to make this colourful comic book world be all that it can be. while whedon, with a weight of expectation akin to atlas holding the world on his shoulders, comes through with flying colours with astute pacing and an impressive marshaling of an acting army.

flaws? jackson's nick fury could have done with more screen time and cobie smulders is sadly short changed as well. the chitauri are only really a threat because of their sheer numbers, not because of any great alien design, and, well, the hulk cgi hasn't really advanced much from the 2008 version, but really these are small itches rather than big ones. is the avengers the best film of 2012? it will be seen as such for many fans of the source(s) who have waited with baited breath for this coming together of their heroes, and that notion really shouldn't irk the more highbrow film fans out there. me? no it isn't the best film of 2012, but as i found my self perched on the edge of my seat as the finale unfurls in a wave of explosive heroic energy, and i caressed my ribs from laughing out loud, i knew then that undoubtedly the avengers is the most fun film of 2012. 9/10",high

ian mckellen (gandalf) returns and is as much a joy to watch as before. none of the others, though all good, stand out massively, james nesbitt (bofur) does bring decent comedic stuff.

2604,"argo is undoubtedly one of the most intense cinematic experiences i have ever had the pleasure of witnessing. from the very first frame, this film had me on the edge of my seat, holding my breath in anticipation of what was to come next. the director's use of cinematography to create a sense of claustrophobia and tension is masterful, with every shot making the viewer more and more anxious. the cramped cubicles of the embassy, the small apartment building, and the crowded streets of iran all contribute to the overwhelming feeling of being trapped with no escape.

what really sets argo apart, however, is the intricate and fleshed-out storyline. every second of the film's runtime is used to its fullest potential, with each integral piece of the master plan receiving the attention it deserves. the movie provides a deep dive into the complex and unbelievable story of the rescue operation, leaving no stone unturned and no detail overlooked.

in addition to the fantastic storytelling, the performances in argo are absolutely top-notch. ben affleck delivers a standout performance as the main character, but the supporting cast is equally impressive. john goodman and scoot mcnairy in particular shine in their respective roles, adding depth and nuance to the already-rich tapestry of the film.

overall, argo is truly a masterpiece of filmmaking. the pacing is perfect, leaving the audience with no time to catch their breath and adding to the mounting tension. the final act of the film is a masterclass in suspense and stress, cementing argo as one of the most memorable movie experiences i have ever had the pleasure of viewing.

2606,"well i can't call it different. i've never actually seen a movie with a plot like this, but it did feel exactly like a low budget cheap drive in comedy/sci-fi show and...kudos.

the best part about this is that, at no point in time, does it take itself seriously. it knows exactly what kind of movie it is and delivers the goods without any pretense, without any attempt to be a better film.

it seems like everyone involved knew the score and did their parts to sell the movie for what it is, and not what they think it could be.

so, what you have is a comedy that is ferociously entertaining. it's a stupid plot with a cheesy script and equally inane characters and it pulls it off brilliantly.

the end result is, when you sit down to watch it, you're going to laugh and be entertained and the time is going to fly by.

2609,"**an excellent film.**

i confess that this movie was better than i was expecting. i thought i would find a simple romantic comedy, conventional and relatively predictable, but i was very pleased with the way the story develops and the conception of the characters. the director, david o. russell, is also responsible for _the fighter_, a film that won two oscars but that i don't think is as good as this one.

the script is, in my opinion, quite well written, and follows pat, a man who has just been released from a psychiatric hospital where he served a sentence of a few months, after catching his wife in the act of adultery and violently assaulting her lover. with his marriage over, he goes to his parents' house, his father being a crazy fan of the town's football team and seems to be convinced that having his son close during games brings good luck to the team. in the midst of his attempts to get close to his ex-wife (who has imposed an injunction on him by law), he approaches tiffany, a young widow, with a strong temper and very explosive manners, who proposes to help him in swaps him being her date in a dance contest.

the story is very good, and it is full of shenanigans arising from the volatility of pat and tiffany's personalities. the characters, played convincingly and very committed by bradley cooper and jennifer lawrence, are complex and demanding, and it was great to see the way in which the two actors were facing the challenge and solving what they had in front of them. furthermore, lawrence won the oscar for the work done in this film, which, in addition, had seven other nominations – best picture, best actor, best supporting actor, best supporting actress, best director, best adapted screenplay and best editing. in addition to the duo of main actors, the film has an excellent supporting cast, including the impeccable robert deniro, the wonderfully restrained and maternal jacki weaver, and the dysfunctional and strange couple played by julia styles and john ortiz.

in the midst of so many good things, is there anything less good or possibly bad? i think so. although i really like the film in general, i feel that the ending was a little cliché, and that the solution found is a little too conventional for a film that seems to want to give us something different from most romantic comedies we are used to. i also thought that there are some characters that end up not getting enough attention (julia styles, john ortiz, in a subplot that gets very sketchy and underdeveloped). but these are points that end up not detracting from the film's value, criticisms and minor repairs.

on a technical level, i would like to positively highlight the excellence of the cinematography, with the film taking advantage of the good filming locations in the city of philadelphia, and the editing, which makes the film pleasant, giving it the right pace. good sets and costumes (in particular what is reserved for lawrence, who has a somewhat depressing look) complete the positive values ​​of a discrete production, without great effects or visual artifices.",high
2612,"skyfall is a great movie. in my opinion the best proformas by daniel craig i have see in all his bond movies. the title song was not to my taste like in previous movies. the story line is one of the most compelling i have seen in a while. silva, played by javier bardem was excellent and he played him very well. all in all a very good movie.",high
2613,"bond (daniel craig) is on another (important) mission somewhere in the big world, this time on the heels of someone who has stolen a hard drive with all the names of the british agents who work for mi6. on the mission, mr. bond is shot by one of his own (an agent named eve, played by naomie harris) and presumed dead. however, bond is not dead, and when he resurfaces, he jumps right into the game in the pursuit of an old agent called silva (javier bardem), an old favorite of m (judi dench).

while bond is out in the world, m discovers that someone, presumably silva, has hacked their computers and threats to expose the true names of the british agents. however, it is also clear that the enemy has other plans, plans of terrorism. bond is now in a race against time before more agents are revealed, or worse yet, before m is killed by their mysterious enemy. fortunately, everything works out perfectly for 007, who finds the mysterious silva with little effort.

ok, admittedly, this was a very short summary of the plot in skyfall, but in all honesty, there isn't a big plot in this movie. i could have given some spoilers about the ending, and maybe added a bit about mallory (ralph fiennes), but really, this is an extremely simple plot. not at all worthy of a big iconic character like james bond.

it is classic 007, with everything thats part of such an adventure, like product placement (not a favorite of mine, in fact i get rather annoyed when its as obvious as the watch in the opening of the movie), car chases (in this case, more like a motorcycle chase across the roofs of some unknown city), beautiful women (which are exactly as shallow and pointless as you would expect), and lastly a total lack of emotions and realism.

i am not a big bond fan, and haven't seen all of the movies in the series, so i am probably not the right person to review this movie. i do not understand what it is that draws people into the cinema time after time, to watch yet another bond movie… when they can watch something original with a real plot and real characters. perhaps these people like the shallow characters, who care little for the safety of the innocent people in the world, yes, i said it. look carefully in the opening sequence, how the female agent cares little for the people on the bridge, as she shoots after the enemy. later in that scene, she finds it really hard to shoot the enemy, because what if she hit bond instead. i may be wrong in this assumption, but isn't mi6 here to protect the innocent people? perhaps these people like the almost infinite number of one-liners that made my ears bleed at one point. why are we treated this way? do the people who makes these movies really think we are so stupid?

before i actually say something nice about skyfall, because i can do that, i just want to give a small piece of advice to future bond villains, because who are we kidding, there will be more bond movies in the future… my advice is this: always remember to close the door behind you, whether its an actual door, or maybe a manhole (cover). if you don't do this, bond will surely find you. but of course, perhaps you are dying to have him on your tail, in which case, you are doing it exactly right!

ok, something positive. skyfall is a beautiful movie, in a very obvious (and superficial) way. the colors are just stunning, especially when we follow bond swimming through the night of shanghai, high above the streets. there is no denying the imagery and action of the movie, in every possible way, this is some of the best the world has to offer. i'd also like to give a shout out to albert finney, whose character (kincade) raises the quality of the movie, and actually give it some human emotion.

the very last thing i want to say is this… why hire sam mendes for this movie? why hire him when he is not allowed to use the powers that god have given him? where are the human emotions, where are the dark humor, where are the personal stories that capture our hearts as much as our minds? if you want to watch a real sam mendes movie, i suggest the following american beauty, jarhead and even, revolutionary road.

_last words... only watch this movie if you have nothing to do… at all… and if you are a hardcore fan of 007 and feel forced to watch every movie in the franchise. this movie reminds me why i only rarely watch big hollywood blockbusters._",low
2614,"how safe do you feel?

bond 23 and 007 has to literally come back from the dead when a stolen hard-drive makes m (dench) look bad at a time when a face from her past comes homing into blood thirsty view. 

there is one sure fire fact in cinema that nobody can dispute, that of there never ever being a james bond film that all bondphiles will agree on. from each corner of the spectrum will come arguments that said bond film is not gritty enough, not fun enough, not enough sex, not enough action, not enough fantastical stunts and etc etc etc. well that's fine of course, we all have our peccadilloes we prefer in our bond movies, but we do live in different times now, the world has changed, and so has bond. you may not get the ultimate bond you want, but this is a 21st century bond and a new era of 007 is upon us, something which makes skyfall even the more bolder and braver because it marks the 50th anniversary by blending the old with the new and mostly achieving brilliant results. 

skyfall allows us to bathe in nostalgia whilst also forcing us to re- evaluate just where we are at in terms of our beloved super secret agent. one of the great things about this bond is that there is a bubbling under current of time's importance delicately perched on each side of james bond's shoulders. is he (and m etc) outdated? or is the future still in need of such operatives/organisations? director mendes and his team don't take any of the easy options that were clearly available to them to answer the question, they instead build a film around bond and m as characters, embrace the traditions of the series and hit us hard in head and heart. 

the plot of skyfall as written is simple, absolutely nailed on it is straight and true to hollywood conventions, but what fills out the simple plot is a series of bondian delights, thrills spills and emotionally splintered kills. the stunning pre-credits sequence sees bond traverse the rooftops of istanbul on a motorcycle and then fight on top of a speeding train. only to then find himself expendable. which leads to daniel kleinman's title credits sequence that is filled with ominous portents of death and blood, in turn backed by the wonderfully bondian of old title song warbled by adele. it's clear at this point that this bond movie is nodding to traditional values whilst promising to deliver some emotional pain. and so it proves. 

a washed up bond enters the fray, and he convinces, he's dishevelled, unshaven and unfit, but he's still a tough bastard who can drink hard and stare a scorpion down. he'll be back soon, we know this, and he will be in wonderful physical shape, and loyal to his surrogate mother for sure. ah, but there's the adversary on the scene now, a villain to finally give craig's bond something to fret about. it's javier bardem's (perfect) silva, a cyber terrorist with a shock of blonde hair, a nasty dental trick and a devilish sexiness that unnerves during an interrogation scene; to which bond cheekily opens up some wink wink possibilities. there is other sexual tension in the film as well, not just a steamy shower scene, but the ongoing banter with naomie harris' (excellent) eve that positively fizzes with smirking innuendo. 

but ultimately this comes down to the love between a man and a woman, the kind that is so different to the type that has so often underpinned a bond movie. bond will kill or be killed for m, and how marvellous to see a director really able to give judi dench the direction she so deserves, and bond, in craig's magnetic and gritty hands, responds in kind to deliver a last half hour as good as any in the 50 years of bond on film. as we know, all turf is bond's turf, but this time it really is his turf, and as a little back story comes seeping out, bond gets to exorcise some demons whilst kicking considerable ass. get ready bondphiles, this has the emotional wallop only seen in the best bond movies of old. 

all the bondian trappings are still here, exotic locales, gorgeous women, speeding vehicles, fights, stupendous stunts, bizarre lairs and balls out machismo. it's also funny! i myself commented when reviewing quantum of solace that it was pretty ace as an action film, but for many it's not bondian enough, and the truth of the matter is bond still needs to have a degree of fun, no matter how grim and gritty the story line is. thankfully skyfall is often a blast, with craig (surely convincing even the most stubborn of dissenters how good a bond he is) having the confidence and skill to lace his bond's macho broody instinct with a desert dry wit and shrug of the shoulders nonchalance. other side of the camera the tech credits are high, with deakins proving to be one of the aces in the pack. his capturing of vistas, be it a neon city scape or a mountainous valley, are eye delights, his colour tones are beautiful, i promise you, nobody these days does golden browns like deakins. 

it's not the masterpiece that i or gazillions of others hoped for, and it does have flaws (new q a bit too geeky safe, finale lacks a substantial battle with the villain) and it remains simple in plot, but it's bond's birthday and the birthday boy has been done proud by the makers. it's a new era bond for sure, but that most definitely isn't a bad thing, it knows its past and it now knows its future, and without doubt we all still know the name. 9/10",high
2615,"me and my oldest son have been doing a bit of pseudo binge watching of james bond. every weekend we have been watching two of the movies starting with dr. no quite a few weekends ago. last weekend we arrived at the daniel craig ones. i had actually not watched those ones before. i have to, grudgingly (i am a sean connery fan), admit that the first two we watched were not at all bad.

however, today we watched skyfall. what the f…? this is not a james bond movie! if it had been just some other movie i would probably have thought it would not be a too bad one. however, it pretends to be a james bond movie and as such it is utter crap. it is a bloody hollywood drama written by someone with a total lack of respect for the franchise, not to mention the old bond fans.

james bond should be out hunting international villains. villains with a good chunk of bad guy charisma i might add. what we got however was some loathsome prick having a grudge because m didn’t come to his rescue when he fucked up.

the british secret service should also be just that, a powerful organisation protecting britain (and the rest of the civilized world) from communists, terrorists, criminal superorganisations like spectre or whatever.  having scenes with m more or less on trial and having to defend herself in front of a bunch of clueless political asshats is just crap and it is definitely not the kind of crap that should be in a james bond movie.

the whole movie is just full of sensationalist shit, politically correct crap, killing of popular characters, sentimental bullshit and other nonsens of the kind you would expect in a bloody hollywood soap opera. and what about the new q? a boring brat with a over-inflated ego. not fun at all.

even the special effects are debatable. for example, if you make a subway train crash by blowing a hole in it’s path then for christ sake put some crash test dummies or something in it to at least make some pretense of it not being an empty mock-up!

this is undoubtedly the worst bond movie ever. my disappointment with this movie cannot be overstated.",low
2618,"full spoiler-free review @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/skyfall-spoiler-free-review

""skyfall is not only the entry that this james bond saga needed, but it's my favorite movie of the daniel craig era. from the exceptionally intriguing narrative filled with shocking developments to javier bardem's terrifying portrayal of a fascinating antagonist, sam mendes offers his remarkable directing skills to create a film worthy of much praise.

the goat of cinematography, roger deakins, makes every inch of the screen drip cinematic beauty with eyegasmic wide shots and mind-blowing lighting, making this the best-looking bond flick ever. technically, it's challenging to find elements less than simply perfect.

phenomenal acting all-around elevates an extraordinarily impactful character work, culminating in an emotionally powerful third act. a slightly overextended runtime doesn't stop me from considering this a flawless bond movie.

i can't endorse it more than this.""

rating: a",high
2620,"**skyfall understands, admires, and elevates bond to excellence and mastery to an unexpected level and unmatched by its predecessors.**

skyfall is the dark knight of daniel craig’s james bond films. sam mendes took all casino royale had built and elevated it to heights never before reached by bond. everything fires perfectly on all cylinders. the story is rich and delves further into the character of a bond than ever before. the action set pieces, the locales, and the cinematography are all masterpieces that establish skyfall as an excellent james bond film but take it further, placing it among the best movies of all time. judi dench’s performance as m cements her legacy as a bond great. and the excellent supporting cast grows with the brilliant casting and performances of naomi harris as moneypenny, ralph fiennes as mallory, and ben whishaw as q. still, the biggest standout is javier bardem as the villainous silva - one of the greatest bond antagonists of all time. his unpredictable and menacing nature is cloaked in a slightly goofy demeanor and skewed moral code. skyfall asks and answers questions unlike any bond before while staying true to what makes james bond so compelling and entertaining. just like the dark knight for batman, even people who are not traditional bond fans will be impressed with skyfall.",high
2621,"by the time skyfall dropped my hatred of craig era bond was pretty solidified. i started to realize that this was going to be the bond that hated being bond. that bond was going to go down a dark hole that i was really going to loath.

but... javier bardem really nailed it didn't he?

javier bardem nailed it. judi dench had her best showing as m... ever, in fact it was so good that it kind of made you made she was relegated to a side character in all the other bond movies.

and the story was great... it was so great that disneyer ripped off huge chunks of it when they made black panther.

by 2012 you got the feeling that sony was going to take the 007 down a dark and evil rabbit hole that would destroy the franchise, but skyfall still ranks as one of the best bond movies in franchise history.",high

poor daniel craig isn't at fault for these totally uninspired, unmotivated stories he appears in.
maybe his agent is at fault. but while craig makes money, his memory will be forgotten in a hundred years, if these 007 fiascos are his high points. 
they probably won't be his high points. good for him.
here, we get more of the modern day movie making which eliminates all the exotic scenery and all the wit and all the inspiration and all the motivation.
instead, we get another demigod villain on the order of horror movies. he may as well be freddy, jason, or wishmaster. that's how he's written.

2638,"risible!

that's my boy finds adam sandler on auto pilot, for this represents him not giving a care in the world about his fans or anyone remotely interested in watching a decent comedy. sure this has fans, and it's not my want to chastise people's personal preferences, especially with what makes them laugh, and certainly making light of serious issues doesn't have me signing up for the next pc brigade march, but this is pathetically played.

it was a colossal failure at the box offices, and it deserved to be. sandler and his writer, david caspe, blend edgy offensiveness with base juvenile comedy, throwing erection and sperm gags together with incest and statutory rape was always going to be tricky to successfully pull off, even more so when sandler and co seem to think shouting loud makes scenes more funny. it's just that it never comes off as a funny whole, just a series of mind farts dotted alongside a potentially warm bonding between estranged father and son thread.

next to this little nicky looks a masterpiece! it's a tough film for sandler fans to defend, and i have been one in the past, but when vanilla ice sending himself up is a highlight then you got problems. whilst susan sarandon and james caan should look in the mirror and ask questions about appearing in this... 3/10",low
2639,"bad watch, won't watch again, and can't recommend.

i really couldn't believe i didn't know about this movie before.  i've organized a series of happy madison watch parties before, but after watching it, then i  know why i didn't know about ti.

now i'm not a big fan of either adam sandler (though he has movies i enjoy, repeatedly) or andy samberg (i think he's better at creating comedy than performing it), but this was really like he was at a party with a big head and bet someone that he could make anything funny.

so, of course, the movie starts with a statutory rape case.  now, maybe, he was making a message out of the ridiculous double standard about whether or not the minor is male or female, but the seriousness of the situation (though flatly stated in the movie) is not conveyed properly.

since most of the movie is about sex, and possibly alcoholism (again, the point isn't made very clearly), there is a fair amount of sex positive messaging throughout the movie, being inclusive of maturity, skin color, body type, handicapability, and open expression.  however because there is a key component of adultery and incest used for humiliation and comedy, it throws any of the previous sex situations into comedy bits, which means not only the message to laugh at people in a messed up sex situation because of incest / adultery (the morality between the two directly addressed), but also statutory rape, the elderly having sex, people expressing thoughts about sex, sex with big black women as things that are comical and that you shouldn't do and should repress.  and if that's a thing, then fine, but don't make a movie about it and make me think about it, and then call it a comedy.

all of that is on top of the usual thing where everyone wants to bang adam sandler, and then he's an alcoholic on top of it, and then we add the litany of things that happen to andy samberg's character, to include child neglect, and probably abuse.  and it's great for a family to rectify and come to terms together, but to make a movie where they bond over donny's awful social magic is a weird message on which to make a production.

look, i like being able to turn off my brain and watch some silly movie, and i was ready for it, but then i go thrown into a someone else's debate about if it's okay for a high schooler to knock up his teacher, and it kind of ruined it for me.",low

the actors do wonderful jobs. alicia vikander is particularly brilliant, as is a fantastic mads mikkelsen. mikkel følsgaard also brings a strong performance, early on i wasn't fully convinced but by the end he won me over tenfold. the supporting cast are very good too.

i'm not a big fan of ben stiller (most of the time), and definitely not vince vaughn.  i like jonah hill, but this is after he found some range and before he learned to control it, intense doesn't not equate funny.  i thought richard ayoade would save it, but he just stood by and watched the train wreck happen.  i do chuckle a bit thinking of him asking the other guys if this is stuff americans find funny.

this has a great premise, average joes find alien invaders, so good in fact, it's basically a trope, but the way this presents it feels like they tried to steal it from ""laser team"" and then legally distinct it from that property.

long story short, there just isn't a lot of value in the movie.  it's not that funny, it is basically a huge commercial for costco and some other obvious brands.  there is so much money poured into something that feels like a waste.

don't get me wrong, it's done by professionals, it looks great, even if i don't like the xenos design, and there is a decent script at the core of this.  there is just an overall fail of execution, and lack of interesting characters and story.

i expected a little more _batman_ than we got (especially with a runtime of 2:45) but while the story around the fall of bruce wayne and gotham city was good i didn't find it amazing. this might be in fact, one of my only criticisms—it was a long movie but still, maybe too short for the story i felt was really being told. i feel confident in saying this big of a story could have been split into two movies.

the acting, editing, pacing, soundtrack and overall theme were the same 'as-close-to-perfect' as ever with any of christopher nolan's other films. man does this guy know how to make a movie!

you don't have to be a batman fan to enjoy these movies and i hope any of you who feel this way re-consider. these 3 movies are without a doubt in my mind, the finest display of comic mythology ever told on the big screen. they are damn near perfect.",high

whilst some think the film is too long for the story i didn't find this. the length of the film is longer than some (but doesn't feel it), i liked that the film took it's time rather than shoving more elements in it - i think this contributed to the dramatic ending (much like a classical piece of music will be relaxed and calm before the final crescendo).

at the end of the day whether you like this film will boil down to if you like films christopher nolan has directed and/or you like the christopher nolan batman series so far.

stupendously good film in my opinion.",high

2668,"so here we have it. the end of a trilogy, the end of an era of the universe of batman through the eyes of christopher nolan. and baby, it goes out with a bang...

going into the theatre tonight i actually wasn't sure what i was up for. i loved batman begins, but i didn't actually care that much for the dark knight. so the big question was, will tdkr actually be more like the first or the second film? the answer is: neither.

this third instalment of the nolan-franchise carries its weight all on its own merits. despite the lack of any kind of intro or opening credits, there actually is plenty of build-up (partly thanks to the insane opening scene). the foundation for a proper, action-packed story is laid down perfectly, explaining things just enough whilst keeping the viewer intrigued to find out more. but if you thought that nolan couldn't surpass his previous work, you will be pleasantly deceived.

christian bale as batman is terrific. never before was a superhero so human, so vulnerable. as his mask of intangibility and anonymity slowly starts to crumble, this is a man who questions his reasons to keep being who he is, and he must figure it out before it is too late. because somebody’s preparing to take him and gotham down, and he might just be too strong for the batman...

this somebody is a character called bane. as a character, an actor and a performance it must be incredibly hard to follow heath ledger's the joker, which was easily one of the greatest villains to ever appear on the silver screen. but tonight, tom hardy took a swing for the fence... and made it. his performance is thrilling and actually frightening, in the sense that you don't just *know* you're supposed to be afraid of this character, you actually feel it. he instils a feeling of horror and discomfort that is not rivalled by many other film villains. what i actually liked about his character the most is the fact that unlike scarecrow, who grew into being a villain, and the joker, who was just a raving maniac, bane was actually (literally) born from evil. born in hell, as it is said in the film. this is not a man, this is a creature. a living, breathing manifestation of evil that cannot be reasoned or negotiated with. hardy's performance is masterful. since his creepy mask is never removed, he, like only a few actors before him, must act without the use of any facial expressions, making his voice is main tool. his manner of speech (and the sound of it through his mask) is enough to send chills down your spine. this is more than just a another villain from a superhero flick, this is a character that just got torpedoed into the top 10 of the greatest antagonists in the history of film. now i realise that's a bold statement to make, but you just go and watch tdkr and prove me wrong.

i would say a slight downside to this film is the overflow of characters, both new and old. aside from the already familiar characters, three new major ones are introduced. and there are also many characters running along in the margin which may seem not important enough to pay attention to, but actually they are so you need to stay focused.

i understand the character of joseph gordon-levitt, blake, was written in specifically for him because nolan wanted him in it. and although as a character he works just fine, it does feel like it was at the expense of gary oldman. as a cop, levitt does everything that oldman's character could've done, but he spends most of his screen time in the hospital, almost like they wanted to get him out of the way, and that's really too bad.

now, i was extremely excited to see what nolan had done with catwoman, because she is one of my favourite film characters. when i heard that she would be played by anne hathaway, i had my doubts. i thought she was just way too sweet to pull this off. but i must say, ms hathaway did a pretty good job. she is actually much more sly and devious than i thought she could be. the nolan brothers, on the other hand, disappointed me here. catwoman isn't really catwoman, she's just a sexy girl in a spandex suit who can kick your ass. her movements aren't even typically cat-like... so that was a bit of a letdown.

i would also like to make a note on michael caine. i think his performance here was so much deeper and more character-driven than the other two films. in fact, there is one scene in particular, where he confesses something to bruce, that almost moved me to tears. and this is actually tdkr’s greatest strength; unlike the other two films, this one deals much more with actual human emotions, it gives us an insight into what actually drives these characters, both heroes and villains alike. 

as much as i would love to, the word-limit restricts me from elaborating more on the characters, so i'll just move on to the technical stuff. and in that department, actually pretty much everything was perfect. the pacing was very well balanced, and during those 2 ½ hours i didn't get bored once. great action scenes alternate with more quiet moments, and the special effects are absolutely awesome. hans zimmer once again delivered a terrific score and there was some high quality dialogue. also in store: a couple of great plot twists and two very cool cameos... there are a few plot holes, but everything else easily makes up for it. 

i highly recommend the dark knight rises. it is a worthy conclusion to the trilogy, and it far exceeded my expectations.

a trillion dollar expedition to discover the “makers of mankind” and they put together a band of asocial morons for crew where not even the scientists among them seems to have met each other before the wake up millions of miles from earth.

aside from their initial franchise, they seem to be unable to create animated flicks without treating the audience like simplistic neanderthals, and the lorax takes the biscuit. patience was running thin just from the introductory musical number alone. a young boy journeys outside the walled plastic city of thneedville to find a living tree so that he can impress a girl, but soon relives a tale that would change his way of life.

this is a mess. perhaps unadaptable due to seuss’ imaginative wordplay that inspiringly illustrates a creative warning against corporate greed and destructive deforestation. illumination on the other hand, whilst consistently producing colourful and vibrant animations, shoved the morality down the throats of its audience. within two minutes, the civilians are singing about their perfect plastic bubble and capitalistic functionality. the main character, not the titular creature, has yet to be seen. a kim jong-un lookalike imprisoning his people in a miniature north korean world fuelled by propaganda. taylor swift refusing to sing any of the forgettable songs. and an underdeveloped insight into consumerism by showing one advertisement for canned air.

danny “rule number 95 kid, concentrate!” devito. a legend if i’m being honest, but terribly mismatched with the moustached beast. in fact, all of the voice acting was generic and forgettable, never truly matching the wide mouths of its unmemorable characters. the, what is essentially two narrative strands, inadvertently produced an underdeveloped arc that had sole intentions on pushing its well-intentioned morals instead of genuine character development and emotionality.

having a movie about a real-live teddy bear existing in the every day life of a 30-something underachiever sounds like a winning formula. however after the first few moments, the movie stalls, the dialog gets stale quickly and the majority of the story revolves around ted getting high and/or trying to bang shallow, attractive women (even though hasbro didn't include on him full, working equipment) while the main character tries to balance his 4-year ongoing relationship with a woman completely out of his league and his life-long thunder buddy (ted).

i myself like a lot of cinematic offerings that require the brain to be left at the door. there's something very calming about being able to sit back and drive oneself into a movie with absolutely no worries about themes, agendas, politico posturing and etc. what shouldn't be tolerated is when film makers ask you to not only leave your brain at the door, but to also dribble with it and slam dunk it into the nearest garbage can.

alexandre aja's 2010 redux of piranha was a whole bunch of fun, even away from the 3d, in 2d form it had a devilish glint in its eye, but this on the other hand is an embarrassment to all involved. who doesn't love the female form? whatever your sexual proclivities et al, you would have to be dead to not appreciate the splendour of eve's offspring. but when it's your main selling point, when you are only trying to please a very small movie watching demographic, then you got problems.

john gulager (director in the broadest context of the word) wants to craft a porky's for this latest hairy palmed generation, whilst he even thinks a touch of grindhouse might curry favour with the mall rats and skaters. everything about this picture stinks, the acting, the hopeless attempts at suspense, badly timed jokes, poor stereotyping, laughable effects work, and on it goes. standing up and saying it's meant to be tacky, corny and tongue in cheek just doesn't cut the mustard here, bad film making is just that, especially when it's done purely to make money.

2809,"the words obliquely poses the question, what would have happened if someone had found the suitcase full of papa hem’s manuscripts that hadley lost at the gare de lyon, and published the con-tent as his own work?

unfortunately, the answer is: not much. the problem, or one of them, is that the movie establishes too long a period of time between the loss of the manuscript — shortly after the end of wwi — and its publishing — presumably, the then-present day.

as we all know, hemingway eventually got over the incident and went on to become arguably the greatest author of the 20th century, essentially rendering the film’s premise moot.

co-directors brian klugman and lee sternthal’s script, however, conveniently has its homologous character, played by ben barnes as a young man and jeremy irons as an old nurseryman, give up writing forever following his soon-to-be ex-wife’s misplacement of his text.

needless to say, this is the least hemingwayesque thing to have done. here’s another couple of problems. wannabe writer rory jansen (bradley cooper) finds the briefcase in an antiques store in paris, and buys it; lo and behold, not only is the manuscript still inside, un-touched — from the gare de lyon in the 1920s to an antiques shop in the 2010s, the briefcase sure-ly must have exchanged hands often (now, there’s you film), and yet it didn’t occur to anyone to rifle through it on the odd chance that it might contain something of value —, but rory actually leaves it untouched (""he retyped every word as it was written on those pages. he didn't change a pe-riod, a comma, or even correct the spelling mistakes""), which doesn’t stop from going directly to the printing press.

it’s at this point that one yearns for a movie like genius, about famed editor max perkins — who worked with the likes of scott fitzgerald, thomas wolfe, and hem himself; even an ernest hemingway at the peak of his powers wouldn’t crap out a best-seller just like that, and it certainly wouldn’t hit bookstore shelves without undergoing extensive rewrites and editing work.

but i digress. the old man (who, again, lacks the testicular fortitude of both papa and the character to which his moniker is a reference) recognizes his work and confronts rory — but don’t expect anything along the lines of secret window; the old man ""just thought [rory] should know the story behind these stories in case anyone was to ask.""

this comes right after the old man admits ""i don't know how you did it. to be brutally honest, i don't care."" but if he doesn’t care, and he clearly ne-ver did, why should we? why even bother?

the whole thing becomes even less urgen when we consider that the old man’s tale is only a story within rory’s story, which in turn is a story within another story: the latest book by novelist clay hammond (dennis quaid), who is discussing it with literary groupie daniella (olivia wilde). enough to make you wonder if there’s a point to any of this drivel, and if so, what the hell it is.

ps. that rory’s adventure is a fictional yarn — which might be based on events in hammond’s life, and then again it might not — could explain that he and the old man live in a world where hemingway existed (a copy of the sun also rises makes a cameo, being read by the young man), but neither ever stops to consider for the briefest moment that their little mix-up is eerily similar to one of the best known anecdotes in western literature.",low

2813,"this is one of the best movies i have watched in a long time. it is a pure tarantino blast. the somewhat unexpected and quite hilarious start of the movie catches your attention from the start and from then on it is 3 hours (almost) of pure enjoyment. 

the main actors are playing their roles very well. the dr. king schultz character (christop walz) is incredibly funny without being ridiculous, jamie foxx is excellent as django and leonardo dicaprio is doing his role well as a plantation owner and slave trader. none of the rest of the crew stood out as particularly bad. well with the possible exception of tarantino himself then when he made his usual in-movie appearance a’ la hitchcock. not that he was particularly bad but he is no actor either.

the movie starts of by dr. schulz liberating django and proceeding to a small town showing django what he is in the business of doing. those first minutes of the movie are somewhat unexpected and very funny to watch. after that the movie gets more serious as django gets to learn to be a bounty hunter and finally gets on with his quest to rescue his “damsel in distress”. it still has quite a bit of “tarantino humour” sprinkled around in it though.

during the movie we are treated to a long series of stereotypical people with, let us say, an “attitude” towards african people. it is tempting to say “nigger haters” but that would not be true since a lot of these people did not exactly hate them. they just did not consider african people to be people but more than live stock for them to use as they wished. unlike a lot of movies portraying these events this one never comes across as boringly finger pointing or overly morally lecturing. nor does it in any way support or glorify the way things were at this time. it is a movie made to entertain set in a period where bad shit happened and using it for the story. nothing more and nothing less.

as usual with a tarantino movie there are some violent parts, some more violent parts and some bloody violent parts in it. the ending fights are a glorious show of destruction and blood splatter. i am sure some people are complaining about the “unnecessary violence”. i am not one of those people. without these parts it would not be a real tarantino movie. as always it is made with the usual exaggeration that tarantino is so good and which reminds you that it is “only a movie”.
this is one of the few movies that i have given 10 out of 10 stars in a very long time. i enjoyed it immensely.",high
2814,"when django is unchained (pronounced jang-oh, not duh-jang-oh)

released in 2012 and directed & written by quentin tarantino, ""django unchained"" stars christoph waltz as an ex-dentist who befriends an ex-slave, django (jamie foxx) in west texas a couple of years before the civil war; they team-up as bounty hunters once they realize how good they jell. the second half focuses on their attempt to infiltrate a mississippi plantation owned by pompous southerner ""monsieur"" candie (leonardo dicaprio) in order to rescue django's wife (kerry washington). samuel l. jackson plays candie's overly loyal house slave.

this is an excellent american western with spaghetti western elements featuring tarantino's typical artistic flourishes. it takes place in the west and in the south, which is reminiscent of the underrated ""nevada smith"" (1966), one of my favorite westerns. waltz is magnetic as the nonchalant protagonist and he & foxx have good chemistry. there's a nice mix of interesting dialogues, amusing moments and over-the-top action. unfortunately, but to be expected, tarantino goes overboard with the 'n' word and the blood-letting, the latter to the point of cartoonish-ness. 

nevertheless, this is an original western that is vibrant with creativity, including stunning locations, cinematography and a great amalgamated soundtrack/score, which includes cuts by ennio morricone, like the excellent ""hornets' nest,"" the imaginative ""the braying mule"" and the moving ""ancora qui."" it's all-around superior to ""the hateful eight"" (2015) because it's not limited by a one-room whodunit plot (although ""hateful"" has its unique points of interest).

the movie runs 165 minutes and was shot in jackson hole, wyoming; evergreen plantation & new orleans, louisiana; and several locations in california (lone pine, alabama hills, semi valley, melody ranch, santa clarita, independence & los angeles). the cast includes numerous peripheral notables, e.g. ato essandohs, don stroud, james remar, bruce dern, ato essandoh, franco nero, don johnson, amber tamblyn and several others.

student of the year aka soty had a pretty good expectations, considering its youngistan theme, makers and star cast of the film, and not to forget the appealing storyline of it. however it had indeed satisfied the expectations, and further more had hit the right chord to their target audience. on the other hand, the movie was compared with many other movies which had similar kind of themes (college campus), but soty is an altogether a complete film with different storyline, and thus provides you a totally fresh and entertaining product.

**story**

it is the story about three friends - abhimanyu singh, rohan nanda and shanaya singhania - and their group of buddies. rohan nanda aka ro (varun dhawan) is a rich son of a well-known business tycoon nanda (ram kapoor), and rules the st. teresa's high school (dehradun) with his style, attitude and riches. he is quite flirty among other girls, but has a beautiful and gorgeous girlfriend, shanaya (alia bhatt). also though ro was a rich son of an entrepreneur, but he had a soft heart for everyone. shanaya is a rich modern girl, who thinks herself as a fashion designer, and rules the college with her charm, beauty, and sex-appeal. now the entry of abhimanyu aka abhi, he hails from a small town and aspires to become a big person one fine day. abhi rules the college with his style, attitude and a perfect victory in everything. this irks ro, and the two often clashes with each other. however because of his soft heart, both of them became friends and then best friends.

the turning point comes when an unexpected love triangle happens between ro, abhi and shanaya, which is further followed by the 'student of the year' competition in st. teresa's high school. how these three people copes up with their complicated relationship, and eventually who wins the coveted trophy of student of the year, forms the crux of the story.

**final verdict**

it's a new age mixture of kuch kuch hota hai and jo jeeta wohi sikander, with a complete different and engaging storyline. on the whole, karan johar's 'student of the year' is a perfect film for all the youngistan, a perfect film for entertainment, and a perfect film to watch it again and again.

now when i say dull i don't necessarily mean that it lacks action (it has a bunch of scenes with action, and being that these zombies run superfast unlike the typical zombies in film and series perhaps even a bit more than the average) but lack of interesting characters or good actors and any sort of originality in script makes it a tired ride.

brad pitt is not necessarily a great actor but he seriously did his most barebones performance here, you were just on the run from zombies with cars flying over and all kinds of stuff but you barely show any sort of emotion? borderline steven segal territory ocassionally, or at the very least jean claude van damme... but without the fighting skills.

2895,"wrong brother.

the early signs were not good, tales of production problems galore and
early critical notices wading in to kick the film before it had even
had a run at the theatres. the lone ranger seemed destined to be a
blockbuster stinker. yet in spite of it noticeably alienating original
lone ranger purists, and some western lovers as well, for a rollicking
action fun packed time then gore verbinski's movie delivers in spades. 

it's awash with the serial silliness of adventure films and tv shows of
yore, pitching good guys against bad guys with buddy buddy shenanigans
pulsing away at the core. the stunts are outrageously enjoyable, the
landscape photography as beautiful as it is respectful in homage to
past masters of the western genre, while in depp's tonto there's a bona
fide hero to root for just as much as he makes you laugh out loud. 

this is an origin story, a tale of how john reid (armie hammer) became
the lone ranger, and of course how the noble steed silver and indian
side-kick tonto became integral to his villain fighting ways. tom
wilkinson and william fitchner file in for polar opposite villain
duties, the former is the weasel business man trying to mould the west
in is own image, the latter a repugnant psychopath with a penchant for
eating human hearts! then helena bonham carter wanders in from some
grindhouse movie for a couple of cameos that are resplendent with
sexual energy. 

it's all very wacky and wild, and rightly so, but this is not at the
expense of very good story telling. some parts of the narrative could
have been trimmed, but as the bromance builds between our two heroes,
and silver gets up to all sorts of comedy horse escapades, there's nary
a dull moment here. producer jerry bruckheimer and director verbinski
throw all the action staples into the pot. chases, fights, swinging
from ropes, shoot-outs, people dangling from speeding train (pic is
bookended by awesome train sequences), grisly deaths and on it goes
from start to end. 

there's caustic asides to the machinations of organisations of the
time, from railroad magnates to the cavalry, while the catchphrases and
legends of the lone ranger tv series are deftly inserted into the tale.
it was interesting to see depp come out and defend the movie against
those damning early critic reviews, it's not something he does, being
as he is very much a guy who sees acting as just a job. bruckheimer,
hammer and verbinski backed depp up, stating that some reviews were
written before the film had even been released, the big budget and
production problems clearly making this a big stinker… 

not so, it's certainly not flawless, and those seriously into
anachronisms are likely to have kittens. but if you haven't seen it
yet, if you was put off by the venomous early reviews, then give it a
chance, you may just be surprised at just how entertaining it is. it
also looks and sounds brilliant on blu-ray, where repeat viewings even
show hammer to be better than first thought as that masked man. 8.5/10",high
2896,"if this film would not have been called lone ranger and would not have pretended to tell the story the lone ranger then i would probably have considered it to be an okay movie. maybe even a good one. however, this was supposed to be a lone ranger movie and that it is not!

i put this movie in the same category as the very disappointing green hornet movie. it is a typical case of some dumbass hollywood producer/director taking a known name and thinks he can do what the heck he wants with it. the lone ranger is supposed to be the only survivor of a group of rangers, a hero as well as intelligent and so is tonto. in this movie the lone ranger is a bloody lawyer, he is naïve and generally a screw up. tonto is, well, as looney as one could expect with jonny depp in the role.

it is really said when you feel the best characters in the movie are the bad guys. i think butch cavendish is quite nicely portrayed by william fichtner. okay, the movie have its fun moments, a few laughs, some nice special effects and is not really poorly done as such. unfortunately a lot of the time i phrases like “what and idiot”, “what the f…”, “this is not lone ranger” and so on, went through my head while watching it.

2905,"escape plan strategises an unbelievable route that never manages to break out of its cliches. stallone and schwarzenegger. the duelling juggernauts of 80s action. an impenetrable maximum security facility monolithically stands in their way, preventing them from being reliable gym buddies and exercising those lucrative vein-inducing steroids. will arnie “be back”? is stallone still missing “adriaaaaan!”

regardless of the nostalgic fuel that pumps through håfström’s reunion, it’s unfortunately weighed down by an implausibly ridiculous plot that believes itself to be smarter than it actually is, diminishing the non-sensical fun in the process. best get “back to da choppa!” ey arnie? (or governor of california...). an escape artist, hired independently to test maximum security facilities by breaking out of them, is setup by his own financial advisor and incarcerated in the most secure prison of them all.

soldiers, probably ex-military, walking around with black ‘v for vendetta’ masks scaring up the prisoners who just want to sleep. schwarzenegger delivering some excruciatingly brilliant one liners as per usual. “you fight like a vegetarian!”. stallone, probably extremely interested and involved, looking generally fatigued and uncharismatic. water hoses shoved down the throats of prisoners, whilst locked in steel boxes (crucial point...) with the brightest and hottest lamps beating down upon them. palaeontologist dr. alan grant recovering from the trauma of ‘jurassic park iii’, by medically assisting america’s most dangerous criminals. and vinnie “i’m the juggernaut!” jones putting the “cock” in “cockney”. suffice to say, it’s a paradise. a beautiful holiday retreat. if only the plot was just as idyllic.

essentially, escape plan fundamentally works due to stallone and schwarzenegger’s chemistry. divert away from this, and plot conveniences, holes and illogicality rapidly take precedent. ray is described to be the ultimate escape artist, which is essentially a cop out description for his character to do literally anything and consider it to be objective fact. example: using broken glasses, paper and other utensils to blindly craft an apparatus that aligns with the moon to determine the equatorial alignment of one’s current location. perhaps this is a legitimate tool that can be created under a prison table. i don’t know. nor do i care. my point is, due to the prison being “the most secure facility in existence”, the actual escape plan requires the audience to promptly suspend their disbelief.

the brawls and action are few and far between, resulting in the remaining hour and half to be weirdly edited conversations where the camera manages to go through stallone’s eye on multiple occasions. in fact the entire editing, from quick cuts to weird scene transitions that remind me of microsoft powerpoint fade out animations, decreased the quality of the general filmmaking. not to mention the obvious green screen and dreadfully unnecessary moments of cgi.

at the end of the gloomy day, you probably wanted to watch this just for stallone and schwarzenegger, in which case you’ll be satisfied. you just have to endure the mountainous implausibilities, overextended runtime and underwhelming conclusion. had it been made thirty years ago, could’ve been good. so perhaps conducting your own escape plan could be better?",low

prisoners is directed by denis villeneuve and written by aaron guzikowski. it stars hugh jackman, jake gyllenhaal, viola davis, terence howard, maria bello, melissa leo and paul dano. music is by  jóhann jóhannsson and cinematography by roger deakins.

when keller dover's (jackman) daughter and her friend go missing, he takes matters into his own hands...

at first glance of the plot synopis, one could be forgiven for thinking this is yet another revenge thriller filled out by police procedural side-bars. how pleasant to find that prisoners has more to offer than a simple who is the criminal? and just how far will a vengeful father go to satiate his grief?.

prisoners is such an apt title because all the main players here are trapped by either mental fragility or victims of their innocence, guilt or chaotic impulses. it's a multi stranded character piece that poses many questions, while of course it has a big mystery element. the narrative features a whole host of clues that might be something, or not, unanswered questions dangle throughout until the finale reveals thge edgy secrets.

it's safe to say that the themes at work here are dark and upsetting, with the core abduction thread siddling up against horredous back stories, torture and religious mania. gruzikowski's screenplay is quality, mesmerising even, there's no lazy filler or extranous sequences, even as the jigsaw pieces are put together in the last quarter, you may find yourself wondering how you missed something so simple?.

this was villeneuve's first english language picture, and it's not hard to see why he was highly touted as one of the next big director beings - his output that followed subsequently bears this out. his control of mood and pacing is superb, his garnering of high quality perfs from his cast (notably jackman and gyllenhaal) is impressive, and his teaming with the great deakins is a match made in photographic heaven.

it tries to make up for this in a few ways: a) bump up the intensity of scenes (comes across forced and awkward), b) add extra violence and dark semi-religious symbolism (seems out of place and largely meaningless), and most importantly c) maintain an air of mystery by throwing left-field plot points at you every 3-5 minutes to keep your attention. 

if you carefully note the clues, about half way through the film it strongly indicates the finale. after that the air of mystery that keeps the film feeling suspenseful largely dissolves and you are left with what feels like a ai-generated script desperately trying and failing to throw you off the initial clues.

in medieval germany, hansel & gretel (jeremy renner & gemma arterton) are now adults and formidable witch slayers, not to mention considered heroes in the community. when numerous children turn-up missing, they trace the problem to an unholy celebration orchestrated by a grand witch (famke janssen). fetching pihla viitala plays a redhead villager accused of witchcraft.

""hansel & gretel: witch hunters"" (2013) is a dark fantasy/action/comedy/horror that takes the german fairy tale by the brothers grimm and envisions events about twenty years later. imagine the excellent “season of the witch” (2011) meshed with the fantasy elements of the fable and you’d have a good idea of this movie. “dracula untold” (2014) and “snow white and the huntsman” (2012) are good contemporary associations, but “hansel & gretel: witch hunters” is noticeably superior.

this movie just kicks total axx from beginning to end with gemma jaw-dropping as the take-no-sheet heroine and renner rising to the challenge. the witches are ee-vil and worthy of nothing other than immediate slaughter, which is basically the siblings’ modus operandi. there’s a lot of thrilling action and gore, some of it so over-the-top it’s amusing; there’s even a terrible troll. and the movie looks great. if you like dark woodsy adventure and don’t mind fantasy, don’t miss out on this excellent film.

2999," it's november 1st, 1971, i'm sitting here with carolyn perron, who with her family, has been experiencing supernatural occurrences.

the key with the conjuring is not that it has freshness on its side, as evidenced by the ream of horror fans arguing on internet sites about ""nothing new on the table"" , but while those fans will be going hungry for a very, very long time, the conjuring does everything right for the splinter of horror it deals with.

there's a lot to admire about a horror film that in this day and age stands tall and proud against the ream of remakes, sequels and teen friendly slashers that ""haunt"" the multiplexes with all too much frequency these days. free of gore and sex, this was automatically going to alienate a good portion of the lustful members of the horror fan base, but for those who like their horror served with appetising scares and a cauldron of suspense, then this delivers plenty to your particular table.

forget the ""based on a true story"" tag, since it's kind of irrelevant in this new technological age, it's a selling gimmick that actually means ""this story might be true and we might have played with it a bit"". regardless of hoax charges and embellishments, just buy into the premise, commit to it as a scary story in the same way as director james wan has, for then the rewards are there for the compliant.

story essentially is based around an investigation in the early seventies by paranormal specialists ed and lorraine warren, who aided the perron family as they were victims of dreadful supernatural events at their rhode island home. wan builds it deftly, letting us into the perron families lives as they move into what they believe to be a dream home. then things start to happen, but again wan builds it in slow instances, creating a palpable sense of dread, his camera work intelligent. so when the big moments come they have maximum impact and have us also yearning for the warren's to get involved.

there is no over killing of the boo-jump scares, they are placed with care and marry up superbly with the mounting tension. naturally all the cliché conventions of the haunted house movie are here, strange smells, creaky doors, ominous cellar and etc, yet these are supplemented with wan's talented knack for a good scare and a very effective production design. from mysterious bruises and literal leg pulls – breath holding games of hide and seek – to bona fide pant soiling moments, the conjuring is a lesson in sustained unease until the big finale is unleashed.

the script is devoid of cheese and pointless filler, itself refreshing in a horror sub-genre that suffers often with these problems. joseph bishara's musical score is an absolute nerve shredder, and again it's a refreshing accompaniment because it doesn't resort to telegraphed shrieks to tell us to be afraid, it never overwhelms a scene. john leonetti's cinematography has gothic textures, both in the house and outside of the lakeside farmhouse, while the strong lead cast of vera farmiga, patrick wilson, lili taylor and ron livingston come up trumps for sure.

met with critical and box office success, the conjuring justifies its reputation as a superb haunted house movie. 9/10

3008,"i guess i am the rare viewer who enjoyed this movie.  but i tend to cut some slack for sci-if movies. i don’t carefully parse out the special effects or pull out a book on physics to make sure every detail is kosher. as long as i am entertained, the plot doesn’t insult my intelligence, and the dialogue is realistic and if possible witty, i am in for the duration.

early in the movie i thought i spotted a rather large plot hole and i thought, oh-oh, but i waded through it. then later i was pleasantly surprised to find they had subtly explained what i had thought was a mistake, and it wasn’t.  perhaps this wasn’t just a space opera with romance and action. i had to pay attention.

i wouldn’t call it a cerebral sci-fi movie, but i am glad i stuck with it.",high
3014,"wow... where do i begin? i just got back from the cinema and i can still feel the adrenaline rushing through me. i was already a huge fan of director neill blomkamp's previous effort, district 9, so my expectations were running pretty high. and for once, i was not disappointed. no, i got even more than i could have hoped for.

elysium is a terrific film. plain and simple. the story is fairly simple, which i consider a good thing because the plot was easy to follow and so it wasn't overly complex and trying to be too intelligent and contrived. it is the year 2154, and planet earth is one hot mess. the rich reside on a space station called elysium while the poor remain on earth, basically grabbing at every straw just to get by. the story we follow is that of max, who, after a terrible accident at work, is in dire need of medical help, which is only available at elysium. in order to get there, he must go to extreme measures. i won't tell you anything else, because that would just spoil the fun.

max is played by matt damon, and he is very good in this role. he truly carries the film, start to finish. it always pleases me to see an actor who is just as good at tackling the character elements as well as the action parts of his role. when you think about it, that doesn't actually happen that often. matt damon can do both perfectly, and he is convincing in every aspect. jodie foster plays the role of senator delacourt, a rich bitch who thinks she can get away with anything just because she calls the shots on elysium. well, somebody's about to prove her wrong... i absolutely love jodie foster, so it's hard not to gush, but she is a delight to watch. her character is cold, calculating and without a sliver of conscience. and jodie is so convincing you just want to slap her. it was great, and the fact that her accent is a little weird and distracting at times, is easily forgiven. william fichtner also appears in a relatively small, but crucial role.

the biggest surprise for me, however, was sharlto copley. remember him from district 9? he played wikus, a dorky and kind of sissy character... well, not in this one. his character kruger, is the meanest, most vile bastard you can imagine. a card-carrying sadistic psycho. it really was a great opportunity for copley to prove his versatility as an actor, and he used it to the fullest. also, somehow his south-african twang made his character even more menacing, so i'm really glad he didn't drop it in favour of a – perhaps more crowd-pleasing – american accent.

my biggest compliment goes to the special effects department. as was the case with district 9, the sfx are so convincing, it's actually hard to realise that you're watching something that was probably 96% computer animated. unlike d9, the visuals were even better here, if you can believe that. usually, when a director's first film is a success and they up his budget for the next one, they go completely overboard and essentially ruin the aesthetics that made the first film so successful *cough*matrix*cough*. in this case, all and everything was a major improvement. the action scenes are incredibly solid, the spacecrafts were eye-poppingly gorgeous (without being all flashy and futuristic – adding to the reality factor) and elysium was a true sight to behold. 109 minutes of pure eye candy.

there were only two things that slightly bothered me. one, the somewhat stereotypical characterization of the rich vs. the poor. simply put, rich = evil and poor = good, no exceptions. especially with the rich elysium folk i found it a little bothersome that there wasn't a single person who seemed to have a heart, they were almost mechanical and so the polarisation was pretty black-and-white. two, the lack of emotional involvement. i didn't really feel much for any of the characters, except max. there is a plot line with a woman he has feelings for, whose daughter is very ill, and that's a sad thing but the film failed at really convincing me why i'm supposed to care. could be personal, but that's the way i experienced it. 

however, these two minor plot points are not sufficient enough to deter me from giving this film any less than 10 stars. what i think is most thrilling about elysium is the fact that it actually paints a frighteningly plausible picture of what our future might just look like. it is, in any case, much more realistic than pretty much every other post-apocalyptic film i've ever seen. don't write this concept off too easily, this might very well be the world we live in one day.

in the end, elysium is a terrifically made film. it's gritty, it's gnarly and highly realistic. and, to the zero-attention-span mtv kids out there, it's also an incredibly entertaining, action-packed thrill ride. tiny side note: the violence is quite graphic at times, so some amount of parental guidance is definitely advised. 

that leaves me with nothing else to say but: go watch this film. you won't regret it.

3018,"let me begin by saying that captain phillips, as an action film, turned out to be much more than i had initially anticipated. i was expecting half drama / half moderate action film with likely a good dash of political hopscotch. it's probably a good thing then, that i knew next to nothing about the actual story, because i love a good surprise. captain phillips is two hours of absolutely intense and absolutely uncompromising physical and psychological anxiety. at the end of it, i literally had to sit for a minute and just breathe, because this story gripped me by the throat like few films in recent memory have.

for those still unfamiliar with the story – this is a retelling of a historical event; the first us cargo ship in 200 years to be hijacked by pirates. during which, its captain richard phillips is taken hostage by the pirates, on his own lifeboat no less.

i got the sense that, somewhere in between the lines it was the director's intention to perhaps create an opening for a different story to be told: that of the somali pirates, and why they do what they do. we are told that they are fishermen, and sheer poverty has driven them to these desperate acts. however, i don't know for sure if i'm supposed to feel any sympathy for these men, if i was supposed to 'understand' their motives – if this was paul greengrass' intention, it didn't work. because no matter which way you swing it, these pirates are the bad guys and that's as clear as day. no degree of poverty or despair should be held as an excuse for such gruesome acts. then again, if this was at all the point, i'm glad it wasn't hammered down in any way. it was merely a thought, and one conveyed subtly enough for anyone to make up their own mind about this issue.

what is clear here, is that these men (only four of them, surprisingly) committed a terrible crime. not even so much the piracy itself, but the kidnapping and abuse of one individual. this individual is played by tom hanks, and he delivers one of his most eloquent and restrained performances to date. here is a man, a captain of a large cargo ship, who is usually very much in control of his life and a clearheaded leader of his crew – but who, in the heat of reality, is just as human as any of us and simply does the best he can, even when (in spite of overwhelming protocol) one simply doesn't know what to do. because protocol doesn't apply to the emotions that take control of both the captain and his captors, when they face a situation none of them anticipated. this is immediately one if my favourite performances by tom hanks, whose strength here lies mostly in the quiet moments in between all the chaos surrounding him. you can tell that he never stops thinking, never stops analyzing his situation, no matter what the pirates do to intimidate him. he conveys it all in the eyes – all the fear and anxiety, while constantly staying calm and collected, trying to talk to his captors, never losing his head. even when fighting for his life, there is an assertive calmness that comes across so strongly that you can do nothing but admire this man. hanks' performance is so convincing, it almost doesn't look like acting anymore... and that's a huge compliment.

the same goes for the other actors, especially the men playing the somali pirates. before being cast for this film, none of them had any acting experience, which makes their performances all the more impressive. then, it also makes one wonder how much of a compliment it actually is when a director literally picks you off the street because apparently he thinks that you're perfectly fit for the part of a menacing pirate, but that's food for another discussion, another time... in any case, he was right about them. these men are absolutely convincing and authentic. especially the leader of the gang, played by barkhad abdi, is right on the money. he needs nothing more than the look in his eyes to convince you that you're right to feel absolutely terrified of him.

from a technical standpoint, captain phillips is very well made. my only grievance is greengrass' typical trademark: the shaky handy-cam. here and there it's almost enough to make you seasick, and i really wish he would ease up on this gimmick, because although it adds to the feeling of suspense and chaos, that doesn't weigh up to the headache it causes. steady-cam was invented for a reason, mister director. use it. still, the other qualities of the film are easily strong enough to make up for this one point of critique. the pacing is excellent, it grips you like a pitbull and never lets go until the credits roll in. colouring and lighting effects are perfectly used for an incredibly realistic feel and claustrophobic atmosphere. everything feels very real and absolutely no sentimental plot devices are exploited here. top-notch screen writing.

i can do nothing other than strongly recommend this film. it is very intense and at times very violent, and definitely one of the best films in its genre. and if this doesn't convince you, see it for one of tom hanks' best performances of his career.

3020,"captain phillips was fantastic, from start to finish. the performances were great featuring one of tom hanks' best. his calmness under extreme pressure was captivating but the ability to have that all crumble down once it is over was just, perfect. his raw portrayal of trauma was one of the most impressive feats of acting i've ever seen. for a nearly two and a half hour runtime, this movie was paced very well, filled with tension throughout. i was holding my breath in so many scenes as the pirates were within a foot of catching a crew mate or as they were creeping closer and closer in their small boarding boat. this constant tension mixed with a fantastic script and story left me glued to my screen for its entirety.

3024,"***too-campy, christphobic sothern gothic fantasy about “casters” aka witches***

released in 2013 and directed by richard lagravenese, ""beautiful creatures” chronicles events in a small town in rural south carolina where a college-minded high schooler (alden ehrenreich) becomes infatuated by a mysterious new girl (alice englert) who recently moved in with her eccentric uncle (jeremy irons) at his creepy antebellum mansion. he learns that they are “casters,” immortals with magical powers; and that an evil relative (emma thompson) wants lena for the darkness.

the director wrote the script based on the first of four young adult books of “the caster chronicles” by kami garcia and margaret stohl. fans of the book, however, say it’s one of the most unfaithful book-to-screen adaptions. since i’ve never read any of these books this was irrelevant to me.

there’s nothing wrong with the production as far as sets, costumes, cast, music goes. it cost $60 million and looks it. the southern gothic air is to die for and the first act is intriguing. unfortunately, the tone is semi-campy where several of the characters are overly cartoonish. it’s reminiscent of comic booky stephen king flicks (e.g. “silver bullet” and “needful things”), but a notch or two more exaggerated.

the first half is also encumbered by an overtly anti-christian slant. i don’t have a problem with movies that depict the evils of fundamentalist legalism, like in “the mist” (2007), but here the stereotypes are so overdone they don’t ring true, not to mention there’s no positive depiction of believers to compare with the negative ones (like in “the mist”). according to this movie, all christians are hateful, rash, judgmental, condemning bigots. lazy writers love stereotypes because they don't have to write interesting complex characters.

take lena’s first day at school where two girls automatically assume she’s “satanic” merely because she lives at the eerie plantation; they then proceed to openly pray for her. it’s so overdone, cartoony and eye-rolling it takes the viewer right out of the movie. this doesn’t even reflect reality in the modern world anyway: even in a backwater town in the usa it’s more likely that a devout christian would be persecuted by mocking unbelievers and nominal christians rather than vice versa. another thoroughly unrealistic element is how all the top community leaders are ee-vil fundies who go to the same church. why sure!

to be fair, the second half halfheartedly tries to make up for this by briefly revealing a more positive christian character and having the pastor give a worthy mini-sermon on sacrifice, but it’s too little too late after misrepresenting and offending half of the viewership.

another problem is how the two protagonists suck face too much. the girl’s only 15. i’m not saying mid-teenagers don’t make-out, but (again) it’s so overdone it’s eye-rolling.

for a better executed and entertaining fantasy/horror flick based on a young adult book series, check out “cirque du freak: the vampire’s assistant” (2009).

the movie runs 2 hours, 4 minutes and was shot entirely in louisiana (covington, madisonville, batchelor, st. francisville and new orleans).

3033,"my god what a disappointment! the original movie had a script worth watching and some good action and special effects. this one, well this was a typical hollywood script written by someone who either was incredibly stupid or just too arrogant to care. it is a script that i would expect from a syfy channel production.

there was absolutely nothing that made sense in this script. the actual plot about chernobyl that was ludicrous to say the least. i’m sure the special effects guys had a great day doing the car chase at the beginning but it was just exaggerated and silly to watch. obviously there are no cops or anything in moscow since they could drive around smashing cars forever without anyone seeming to care. they walk into chernobyl and sprays some magic fluid onto the highly radioactive place and voilà, the radioactivity is gone and they can take off their protective suits. what a load of bull! they steal a car and drive to chernobyl (which is around 1000 kilometres away and the roads in russia are not western highway standard) and they still manage to get there in time to catch the bad guys who are in choppers. not to mention the fact that they actually get near the place without being stopped. i can go on with this but it is only more and more depressing.

oh, my favourite (sarcasm), switzerland have obviously invaded france since grenoble is now in switzerland. funny that i, who lives a couple of hours drive from grenoble, have not heard about this. that is just so typical dumbass american script writer who have never set foot outside of hollywood. maybe it was supposed to be funny but i honestly do not think so and in any case, it was not funny.

the only reason this movie gets a 4 out of 10 star rating is because the special effects are indeed impressive if you can push yourself to look past the ludicrousness of them and it is bruce willis after all. it is a shame that they obviously handed the franchise over to some idiot(s) that obviously where utterly incompetent at what they were doing.",low

3041,"*** this review contains major spoilers ***

this is actually not so much a review as it is a vehicle for me to express my utter disgust of what was supposed to be a great sequel to what i consider one of the coolest movies ever made. i absolutely loved kick-ass. it was fresh, it was original, and in spite of its crude and graphic violence, absolutely hilarious. its sequel, is nothing short of an abomination.

for your convenience, i have comprised a list of everything wrong with kick-ass 2:

1. the gore. it's not that it was worse than ka1, it's that it was very different in tone. whereas in the first movie – where the violence was equally gut-wrenching – the nature of it all was laugh-out-loud hilarious, mostly because it was executed by a foul-mouthed 12-year-old school girl. ka2 on the other hand, feels more like a snuff movie where good guys and innocent bystanders are brutally slaughtered, just for the hell of it. which leads me to point number two:

2. the targets. in the first movie, the whole point was easy: killing bad guys. so, no bad feelings and no conflict of interest. for the second installment, it seems the moral compass has taken a 180 degree turn. here we have to sit and watch the good guys dropping dead one by one, and it isn't the least bit funny. i'd like to give you a heads-up on the brutal murder of dave's dad, the most innocent good guy of them all. yeah, i didn't see than one coming either.

3. the bad guys. good god. rarely have i seen such an array of dumb, sickeningly stupid villains. most of the slaughtering and mayhem is done by one block-of-concrete-with-boobs called mother russia (what's in a name?). everything about her just makes you sick to your stomach, especially the way she offs her victims. she is part of the main villain's gang, and don't even get me started on this guy… remember red mist? he was pretty funny in ka1, wasn't he. yeah well, those days are over. after accidentally on purpose killing his own mother (!), he proclaims himself the new great villain of new york, henceforth calling himself the motherf***er (again, what's in a name…). he rallies a group of equally douche baggy cronies. their mission is to kill kick-ass and all who follow him. their first strike? killing off the best new character.

4. jim carrey's screen time. the poor guy clocks out at exactly 7 minutes and 45 seconds. he plays colonel stars and stripes, and he is by far the best addition to the cast. what's remarkable about his performance is that he's barely recognizable. his speaking voice is low and brooding, and there's not a funny face in sight. really cool character all around. after waiting for what feels like forever for him to finally appear, guess what; not ten minutes later – gone. impaled, slaughtered and decapitated by mother russia. i'd like to have a hearty word with the ""screenwriter"" who's responsible for this. he needs to go back to school. here's my advice anyway – free of charge: you don't kill off the best character halfway through the movie. dumbass.

5. the ""humour"". in ka1, the humour was cheeky, intelligent, and perfect satire. and where it was crude, it was right up at the top, but never really over it. second time around, we have to make do with projectile vomiting and violent diarrhoea. really, poop jokes…? now this is a perfect example of what 'we' (we meaning – people over 13 with normal intelligence and a healthy sense of humour) call ""rock bottom"". yes. they go that low. i'm going to stop here before i start remembering all of the other ""jokes"". 

6. lack of proper hit-girl action. hit-girl was always the star of the show. in ka2, she is given a dumb sub-plot where she vows to quit her alter-ego job and become a 'normal', prissy little cheerleader, competing with other barbie girls to become popular. i really, really hated this story line. i don't even care if it was in the original comics, it sucked. the reason why it sucked the most is because effectively, this means that the essence of hit-girl is completely vacant for about 60% of the movie! and that's way too much time for the most beloved character to mope around apologetically before she finally gets her s**t together roughly 10 minutes before the end of the movie.

7. mister kick-ass himself. something went wrong here. i don't know if it was the character that was poorly written or aaron taylor-johnson that came up short, but he was very different from the first movie, in which he had a really cute, geeky charm about him. here, he was inconspicuous and dull, like a bystander in his own story. or perhaps he was just overshadowed by the abundance of new and reformed characters… in any case, he was barely there to be noticed.

8. soundtrack. the score of ka1 was so damn cool, with original, poppy punk music and electro that consistently added something to every scene. here, i only remember one scene that caught that vibe and it still wasn't half as good.

9. it was seriously offensive. a ""joke"" about rape? are you kidding me?! and i'm not talking about some guys hanging around, talking about wanting to 'do' some girl or whatever. no, i'm talking about the motherf***er seriously intending to rape night bitch, except he can't because he's got no wood. real classy.

there are some redeeming points to this otherwise complete crap fest, but honestly, they are so few and far in between they're not even worth mentioning. well, i guess this is what you get for hiring some d-grade nobody to replace matthew vaughn. don't waste your time with this garbage.

3047,"when monstrous, building-sized creatures (dubbed ""kaiju"") hell-bent on destruction begin pouring out of an extra-dimensional fissure at the bottom of the pacific ocean, humanity bands together to build titanic mechas called jaegers, each controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are linked through a neural bond called ""the drift."" as the kaiju get stronger and the signs point to an all-out flood of the beasts, the fate of humanity looks bleak, and the surviving jaegers are brought together for one last-ditch attempt at saving the world.

after an agonizingly long five-year wait, filled with some heartbreaking starts and stops (like the almost-weres of the hobbit and at the mountains of madness), guillermo del toro has finally returned with his biggest budget and story yet. the mexican master of fantasy returns to the toybox of his youth, drawing from the kaiju films of old (godzilla, gamera, mothra, and the like) and anime to create the modern-day monster movie we didn't even know we wanted.

i am a genre man through and through, and del toro's films are filled with both the intelligence of the best of science fiction, fantasy, and horror and a flawlessly-rendered vision unique to him. his innate knowledge of what makes those outlandish stories truly matter to us is the backbone of his work as a writer and director, and his visual style is one that invokes true wonder.

it's that wonder, that childlike glee that makes pacific rim work so well, and well it does work. this is a brawny, massive film made by a true artist and auteur at the top of his game, but while the technicals of this film could have been mounted by any number of working directors, the magic of guillermo del toro is that he infuses every film with himself. his love of the material, whatever it may be, shines brightly through every frame. it is this complete sincerity that makes his films such a joy to experience, and even when there are 250-foot behemoths slugging it out on the screen, there's not a trace of the disastrous irony or cynicism so readily supplied by other blockbusters anywhere to be found.

the cast gamely comes to play, with idris elba (tv’s luther) as stacker pentecost (one of my favorite character names of all time) as the stoic leader of the jaeger program, charlie hunnam (tv’s sons of anarchy) as former pilot raleigh becket, who suffered a tragic loss and has to be convinced to return to jaeger service, and oscar-nominated rinko kinkuchi (babel) as mako mori, another life touched by the kaiju and ready to serve up some righteous fury. if these sound like tried-and-true archetypes, it’s because they are. this is a grand, epic war film on a bigger scale than anything ever attempted before in that genre, and one of the strokes of genius from del toro and original writer travis beacham is that we instantly establish and identify with the characters onscreen. there are so many ideas flying around (monsters, mechas, neural bonding, kaiju culture, and many, many more) that the broadly-drawn characters serve as a perfect anchor for the audience, immediately relatable in their inherent humanity.

it seems that the mission statment of this movie was, in a word, “texture.” del toro delivered a visual feast unlike any other big spectacle films, with his insistence on it not looking like a “glossy car commercial.” instead, every frame is filled with rain, snow, scuffs, smoke, debris, and other visual elements that reflect the weight and dimension of these cyclopean combatants. unlike the ultra-glossy (and emotionally irrelevant) transformers films, or virtually any other modern big-budget actioner, this universe feels dirty, grungy, and lived-in, like the original star wars trilogy.

in fact, dubbing a film “this generation’s star wars” has been overused to the point of robbing the phrase of all meaning. but pacific rim feels just like that. it invokes those most elusive of emotions in the modern studio film: wonder, awe, and sheer enjoyment. do you remember the awe you felt upon seeing a star destroyer creep onto the screen? discovering a brachiosaurus on isla nublar? laying eyes on the verdant fields of middle earth? this film has that. no one builds worlds like del toro, and here he is, the master, inviting you to play in his sandbox with him. grab your favorite action figure and hop in.",high

3064,"**it took off reasonably well, but if we push it, it quickly stalls.**

i know that this movie is a spin-off from “cars”, but do you know? i was more curious to see this film than i am to see “cars” (i haven't seen it yet, i will see it very soon). it's just that, despite driving, i've always felt great affection and interest in the world of aviation, to the point of spending afternoons at the airport to watch planes arrive and depart when i was younger. i was also a regular spectator of the red bull air races whenever they were held here in my city. i know the film had relatively mixed reviews, with many critics hating it and others trying to see various saving qualities in just about everything. personally, i'll be fine halfway through: the movie isn't disastrously bad, i believe that, as far as the disney universe is concerned, i've seen far worse, but it's also far from good.

starting with the qualities, it is impossible to deny that the animation and visuals of the film were well done and are pleasant to look at. the computer effects and digital animation are the best available, and without a doubt, disney had the people and expertise in-house for the task at hand. the models used in the planes in the film are reasonably similar to their originals in real life, which reveals that the production was attentive to details and tried to give the film a very acceptable dose of realism. even more impressive is the footage of the races and aerial maneuvers. the film is very well edited, it is not bulky or heavy and does not stretch too much, being very suitable for young people, and quite tolerable for everyone else, including adults.

the work of the voice actors, for me, is at a very acceptable level, but not brilliant: with the exception of john cleese, who has an unmistakable tone and accent, and dane cook, who does an equally good job, the overwhelming majority of the voice actors just do what they had to do. i liked priyanka chopra, i think she managed to avoid the temptation to give her voice an overly heavy indian accent that people might not have liked, and julia louis-dreyfuss for her use of canadian french. carlos alazraqui sounded too dense to the point where i thought he was antonio banderas, and the accent was too strong, but he at least knew how to be funny.

for me, one of the things i didn't like is the way the soundtrack is so dull. the only moments in which it stands out and sounds good are in the love serenades and at the moment when planes fly over the taj mahal. if we consider that songs have been one of the strengths of disney animation, it's impossible not to be sad about it. but the script is where, really, the big problems of this film are: what the film brings us is the recycling of the old sports success story that we have already seen thousands of times in thousands of modalities: the outsider with no chances who, for his good heart, goes on succeeding and wins, after defeating the perverse and envious rival. and of course: there's a romance going on there, and the pretty, nice girl isn't all that innocent. it's old, it's cliché, it's not enough for what disney has used us to, and it's sad to see the studio settle down like this. the dialogues didn't help: i can still understand and accept the aviation jargon, but the sheer amount of clichés and barbershop talk is too much for me.

regarding the characters themselves, what i want to say is simply this: they are not really well-developed, and the poor quality of the script leaves one to guess to what extent this is true. however, and directly addressing an issue that has raised some controversy, i understand and accept the ethnic allusions and cultural “stereotypes” that were applied to each plane. i know that there are more and more people who take this badly, and i agree that yes, it is generally offensive and reductive. however, this is an animated comedy, it is not something that i feel should be taken too seriously, and if we consider that each plane represents its country, this turns out to be a way to bring a little bit of the mental imagery of that country to its representative. thus, the english plane is very cordial, but sarcastic and has a peculiar humor; the mexican plane is romantic and has the craze that is zorro; the canadian plane speaks french, the indian plane has saffron color and elaborate designs etc. if i, who am portuguese, were seriously offended whenever films or series show a portuguese character as a football player, a bearded sailor or a baker with a mustache, i wouldn't have time to do anything else in this life!",low

snowpiercer is getting a tv adaptation soon, so now it's the best moment to rewatch one of the best movies in 2014. at the time, bong joon-ho wasn't exactly a famous director that everyone knew about. therefore, the cast led by captain america himself, chris evans, and the intriguing premise did all the work in creating the cult following it got. ironically, i haven't watched this film since its release, so this is only my second time boarding its train. i'm going to start with the best thing that this movie possesses: its screenplay.

this is one of the most shocking films i've seen when it comes to delivering jaw-dropping twists, one after the other, exclusively through dialogue. as it would become a staple in bong joon-ho's filmography, his writing is so incredibly complex and multi-layered that it's truly a miracle that his movies end up making any sense. snowpiercer (which is co-written by kelly masterson) has literally dozens of logical questions that any other film would not only fail to explain, they wouldn't even try to. with any other screenwriters, this movie would feel too far-fetched and hard to believe. but it's far from that.

each character receives extraordinarily elaborate development, filled with mind-blowing revelations and eye-opening twists. every line of dialogue, every picture, every camera movement, every shot, every scene matters. everything the viewer sees or hears either means something or foreshadows an eventual payoff. snowpiercer is the definition of ""every shot counts"". don't you dare go to the bathroom without stopping the film first. you'll undoubtedly miss something significant. absolutely brilliant screenplay and astonishing, well-written characters.


it's indisputably a narrative-driven story. snowpiercer is a lesson in exposition. even though there's plenty of action (i'll get there), it's a movie that relies on the viewer's ability to be captivated by dialogue. the concept is definitely unique, and the story is extremely captivating, but only if the viewer can understand the value of entertainment in listening to these characters while they go through their revolution... in learning who these characters were, are and will be. just as an example, there's a third act's monologue performed by chris evans that not only delivers tons of information about his character, but it's also emotionally compelling to watch. if someone doesn't *feel* anything during this scene, then maybe snowpiercer might not be the movie for you.

i find the platform to have a similar concept. instead of a train, it's a vertical prison, but the allegory of how society works is evident in both films. how politics, religion, and early education can control humanity. the top/front people not only receive more than what they need, but they still overuse everything, completely ignoring the bottom/tail humans that need to fight for scraps. these films take entirely different paths, but snowpiercer owns a much more complex narrative than the platform. however, it's still interesting to see the comparisons between these two distinct approaches on a similar theme.

nevertheless, for everyone that needs some sort of dynamic entertainment, this flick is also packed with action set pieces. there's a tiny bit of too much shaky cam for my taste, but overall, it accomplishes the mission of delivering the chaotic, energetic, claustrophobic environment that the action sequences need. it's a train, after all. it's not like they could produce massive battles in such a small space. in fact, the screenplay allows the crew to show some really creative, innovative techniques. the use of slow-motion (not only during the action scenes) elevates the movie, generating great suspense/tension, and it's perfectly timed (including a fantastic one-take sequence with chris evans).


since i just mentioned him, might as well address his impressive performance. people might not remember this, but at the time of the film's release, evans was interested in pursuing a directing career, setting his acting as a secondary role. while i do believe he's going to make a great director, i'm beyond happy that he continued to use his acting abilities. as with most of mcu's actors, i feel like he's pretty underrated considering what he has demonstrated throughout his career. snowpiercer is just the tip of the iceberg. chris evans is a remarkable actor and much more than ""just"" a version of captain america.

tilda swinton (mason) also offers a quite interesting display, octavia spencer (tanya) is fascinating, while the legend ed harris (wilford) takes his short but effective screentime to prove how gifted he is, especially concerning plot exposition. he's always able to be captivating by merely opening his mouth. marco beltrami's score is riveting and memorable. the editing (steve m. choe, changju kim) is not only seamless, but it definitely helps the viewer better understand the story. finally, the production and set design are impeccable, offering the ""one-location"", claustrophobic vibe that a train unavoidably has.

my only major issue involves the ending. it's quite impactful but also underwhelming and morally divisive. a particular decision that affects everyone in the train (basically, the entire humanity) doesn't quite convince me that it's the best conclusion. it sort of diminishes some of the characters' efforts to get where they do, as well as the story's initial purpose. on one hand, it's an ending that raises a few questions in a movie that does a terrific job in explaining every little detail until this last moment. on the other hand, the train is far from giving a fair life to everyone...


in the end, snowpiercer is not only one of 2014's best films but also one of the best of the respective decade. with a brilliant screenplay, bong joon-ho delivers an extremely complex narrative, filled with emotionally shocking character development, and featuring excellent stunt work. the underlying theme of how humanity is controlled by how its society works (from politics to religion to education) cleverly accompanies the already twistful story. snowpiercer is a phenomenal lesson in ""exposition"", and the definition of ""every shot matters"". boasting jaw-dropping performances from everyone, especially from chris evans, every dialogue is remarkably captivating, packed with mind-blowing revelations, and an unbelievable effort in explaining every little detail regarding the train's functionality. this would undoubtedly be at the top of the decade's best movies if not for a morally divisive and somewhat underwhelming/questionable ending. technically, an addictive score, amazing editing, and impressive production/set design put the final stamp of quality in a brightly original, unique piece of cinema.

3067,"soporific shocker in shaky-cam.

what is it with mars based movies? it's a planet that has been in all our lives via press, geography, history and etc, yet when it comes to film it proves to be a subject too much too far for some film makers.

the makers here add a zombie slant to things, which in truth is just another excuse for a monsters on the loose plot. only it's in shaky-cam this time, the hope obviously was to add realism to the preposterous story. on the page it clearly had potential to be a fun-packed thriller, the execution sadly not only wastes a grand cast list, but plays out as dull and introduces nothing remotely smart or interesting to the sci-fi and horror genres. 4/10",low

3071,"_**a boy coming-of-age near cape cod and more**_  

a 14 year-old boy (liam james) struggles to fit-in with the family & friends of his mother’s new beau (steve carell) as they partake of a vacation at his beach house in the cape cod area. the teen finds a quasi-mentor (sam rockwell) at a water park while developing a friendship with the cute neighbor girl (annasophia robb). toni collette plays the mother, allison janney a friend and amanda peet a flirty woman.

“the way way back” (2013) is a coming-of-age flick that meshes elements of films like ""the squid and the whale"" (2005), “the summer of ’42” (1971), “meatballs” (1979), “swimming” (2000) and “lawn dogs” (1997), but this is arguably the best of them. 

part of the genius of the movie is that the potential stepfather (carell) isn’t made out to be totally evil nor is the seeming mentor (rockwell) perfect. they’re both flawed men with presumably good intentions toward the boy, but only one proves that he’s a worthy father-figure. moreover, the all-around writing/acting smacks of real life.  

annasophia is super cute on the female front while zoe levin is alluring as the pouty, bratty stepsister. meanwhile andria blackman has a standout cameo as the girl in a yellow bikini.   

the film runs 1 hour, 43 minutes, and was shot in the cape code region of massachusetts: wareham & nearby onset; marshfield & nearby duxbury.

3086,"i was not impressed by this movie. having said that i do not think it deserves the many 1 star ratings that it have received nor do i think that the acting by neither will smith nor his son jaden was as bad as some people claim. my gripe with this movie lies more with the actual implementation of the story.

the basic idea is not really a bad one. it could have been made into a rather good movie. however the result that we see is rather shallow. worse it is riddled with stupidities and illogicalness.

the movie starts off with the all too common humans are destroying the planet, we are so bad, bla bla. i am so tired of seeing that crap being stuffed into movies (and books) left right and center. when i read want to ponder those questions i read the appropriate science papers. stop stuffing it in my face when i just want to be entertained.

then we get to know that some alien presence where dropping monsters on the humans. monsters that where genetically bred to kill humans. okay…? if they wanted to exterminate us why make it in such a long-winded way? and what happened afterward? when it apparently failed to exterminate us did they just go “oh well” and left?

the basic story of the film is that the ship carrying cypher and katai crash lands on old earth which are now supposedly inhabitable for humans. okay but, apart from the fact that a thousand years in the future one would have thought that they could avoid meteor storms easily, what is this mumbo jumbo that cypher can somehow “feel” the storm coming?

let us continue with earth itself. it is supposed to be inhabitable for humans. could they not have made a little better effort to make it look inhabitable then? it looks like a semi-tropical/tempered paradise to me. also, the temperatures are supposed to drop to well below zero every night yet the vegetation is abundant and green? while we are on the subject of vegetation, how the bloody hell can they need “breathing pills” when the vegetation, and thus the oxygen production, is that abundant? things like this just sticks out like a sore thumb and drags down the movie.

then we have these ursa’s. they are bread for the purpose of exterminating humans. they are blind and tracks the humans by the fear pheremones. say again? what kind of idiot alien would do such a thing? any bioengineer worth their salary would ensure that such a creature had every advantage they could get. that would include sight and hearing as well as smell (and probably a few other senses like infrared as well). also, this idea of having to be fearless is just dumb. apart from simple things like staying downwind the only thing the humans would have to do was to outfit their soldiers with airtight combat suits.

i am not saying that a science fiction movie (or any movie) should be all science and believable but this movie is just too filled with glaring stupidities. for me it is not the total turkey that some people seems to think it is. it has some entertainment value but not more than 4 out of 10 stars worth.",low

3094,"i never thought i’d use the term idiot plot to refer to a film starring annette bening, ed harris, and robin williams, but then i’d never watched the face of love. nikki (bening) is a widow who is still pining for her dead husband garrett (ed harris) five years after he drowned on a beach in mexico. 

one day she meets tom (also harris), who looks so much like her late husband – complete with the exact same tone of voice and male pattern baldness – that the only possible explanation is that garrett and tom were twins separated at birth (i would also accept cloning, at least as the movies usually (mis)understand it).

the movie, however, offers no explanation for the fact that tom is a perfect replica – down to each and every single wrinkle – of garrett (or viceversa), other than “you know what they say. we all have a double somewhere in the world.” 

nikki becomes romantically involved with tom, but never even bothers to mention his uncanny resemblance to her defunct spouse. why not? it would be the perfect icebreaker, and tom would know it’s not just a pick-up line as soon as nikki shows her a picture of garrett.

she is also concerned, more reasonably so given the circumstances, by what people, especially her daughter summer (jess weixler) and neighbor roger (williams), might think about her dating someone who appears to be an alternate reality version of garrett. 

this actually leads me to believe that tfol would have worked better as a comedy, with nikki going out of her way to talk tom into an extreme makeover – the movie, nevertheless, is hell-bent on being a drama, and in that sense it would have been well advised to have tom played by an actor who isn’t harris but can reasonably pass for him (john malkovich, maybe?).

given the quality and credentials of the stars, i have no choice but to point an accusatory finger at director arie posin and co-writers posin and matthew mcduffie, who manage to get wrong even what they get right; case in point, williams gives the film’s best performance in what is essentially a throwaway role – one would have expected roger, who was garrett’s friend and has feelings for nikki, to at least attempt to drive a wedge between the lovers, but he and tom never even come face to face (again, if this were a comedy, and i’m more and more convinced it should have been one, roger would have gone to hilarious extremes to shape himself in garrett’s/tom’s likeness to win nikki over. oh well).",low
3098,"surprising depth and quality

expecting yet another revenge/vigilante movie - statham is an action guy, right? - i was disappointed, but in a very positive way. this movie has character development, good acting, and a story with more depth than to be expected. it's no psychological masterpiece, but it goes far beyond a simple action flick.

it starts out simple, though. former soldier became drug addicted bum, living in the streets; by accident, he gets a way out. and into moral grey zones - very dark grey. 

there is a love story in it, but it is a good one, i think; two complex characters each struggling with themselves, and their lives. and the most gripping part for me was where we see two people waiting, watching other people.

fear not, it's not all artsy and emotional; there's a bit of action as well - solid quality, reliably delivered by statham (and a good team). with a small side of humour. violence is not the core of this movie; it's just part of the story. which is a dark and gritty one.

3109,"but no piece of art is worth a human life... 

trance is directed by danny boyle and adapted to screenplay by john hodge from joe ahearne's film of the same name from 2001. it stars james mcavoy, vincent cassel and rosario dawson. music is scored by rick smith and cinematography is by anthony dod mantle. 

art auctioneer worker simon (mcavoy) does the double-cross on franck (cassel), his partner in an art heist, but after taking a blow to the head suffers amnesia and can't recall where he has hidden a stolen goya masterpiece. franck and his thug side-kicks decide to send simon to hypnotherapist elizabeth (dawson) in the hope of unlocking the painting's hiding place. however, once the therapy starts, secrets come tumbling out and nothing is ever as it at first seems. 

already this early in the day after the film's release, we know for certain that danny boyle's foray into neo-noir is going to split his fan base considerably. admired for his ability to turn his hand at any genre he fancies, boyle reaches back to his earlier movies and comes up with a mind bending neo-noir that crackles with the kind of sexual edginess that paul verhoeven thrived upon. it sounds snobbish i know, and i have been called a neo-noir snob recently, but if all things noir are not your thing then this really is a film you should stay away from. think basic instinct meets inception and they take out a 40s heist movie for drinks and you get an idea where we are at with trance. 

all the hallmarks of noir, both neo and conventional classics, are evident here, from characterisations to visual smarts, it's a noir head's dream and very much a must see on the big screen or on blu-ray formats. forget any notion of having someone to root for in this, there is scarcely a decent human bone on show. characters are either fuelled by greed, lust, jealousy or vengeance, or quite simply just not smart enough to operate in the circles they move in. amnesia is a key component of the story, something which again features a lot in olde noir, as does the central character being a complete dupe...to expand upon more would be stupid of me, the less you know the better it actually is upon first viewing. it really is a difficult film to discuss without delving into why it is such a trippy and deliciously cheeky piece of film. that's not to say that narratively it's smarter than a brain pie, because that's not the case. for as the threads untangle, several times, the mind meld aspect will fall apart if plot dissection is your thing? also cramming so much ""brain food"" into the last quarter of film kind of feels like too much, overkill if you will. while franck's side-kick bad boys are irritatingly disposable. yet it's a film that begs to be seen more than once, twice, thrice even... 

visually it's superlative, it's clear that boyle and mantle know and admire noir's visual splendours, with an awareness of atmospheric importance (noir is an atmosphere, not a genre. there's the snob in me again!) pulsing throughout. set in london but filmed out of dungeness in kent, the backdrop is a city of steel and mirrors, a thriving city of wealth and mistrust. the tricks of the trade are here but never once is it style over substance, the visual ticks matter to the narrative. night time overhead shots of a bustling city come and go, different colour tones for different character's apartments are clever, oblique camera angles ensure distortion of frame is equal to distortion of antagonists/protagonists minds (whose trance is this, really?...). smudgey silhouettes through bronze glass, outrageous pov shots and caressing camera shots of the human form, no shot is wasted in the name of adding detail. rest assured, boyle brings his ""a"" game here. all of which is covered over by smith's slow rumbling score that acts as a foreboding observer ready to unleash itself when the carnage begins. 

the three principal actors come out firing and clearly are enjoying themselves. mcavoy cements his ""a"" list credentials with a multi layered performance, cassel is as usual a mighty presence and dawson, in a bold role, does her best work so far and hints she's ready to move into the big league. while it has to be noted that all three actors have to play their cards very close to their chests throughout; and do so admirably. boyle's action construction is kinetic, with the pre-credits sequence one of the best opening sequences lately, and hodge's script has a playfulness about it that ensures those paying attention know the film is self-mocking and not taking itself half as seriously as some film fans seem to think. an audience splitter it is sure to be, but for those with a bent for noirish sexy mind bending heist capers? get in there! 9/10",high

this one has a story which was rather okay and held somewhat together. you have to remember that this is a comic book hero and the story is on that level of course. the special effects and the scenery is really nice as well. the views of asgard is cool, almost breathtaking.

anthony hopkins was excellent as odin or oden has he is called in sweden, my country of birth. tom hiddleston is also very good in his role although i have to say that i really do not like his role but then he is supposed to be one of the bad guys so… chris hemsworth is good enough in his role but i would say that he is really the weakest ones in terms of acting.

the movie is liberally sprinkled with jokes as well and, thankfully, most of them are not too bad. although a bit silly i have to say that i did laugh when thor politely hung mjölnir on the clothes rack in the apartment with darcy and dr. selvig.

3126,"watching thor: the dark world tonight, i got the feeling that hollywood might have finally figured it out. in theory, a sequel should always surpass its predecessor, although as we all know, many have tried and famously failed. but a new trend seems to finally be breaking through. x2 was better than x-men. spider-man 2 was better than the first. and now that i've seen it, i can tell you thor: the dark world… is better than thor. (and the fact that these are all marvel productions, that's food for anther discussion.)

i thoroughly enjoyed thor, directed by kenneth branagh, when i only saw it for the first time just this spring. in fact, i watched it again the same week. which is saying enough to imply that my hopes were high for the sequel. so i was really looking forward to tonight and i was not disappointed.

thor 2 was helmed by a different director, alan taylor, which typically always spells trouble in my book when they change the director, but i take my hat off to him. what i admire is that he managed to capture the tone that branagh set in the first film flawlessly – even perfected it in a way. he brings to the table a duality which almost never works successfully in any film, but here, does so perfectly: taylor made thor 2 notably darker, yet at the same time more humorous. i take my hat off to the writers as well – they put in a ton of great jokes, all at the exactly right moment. had this been done even a fraction less tactfully, the film would have sunk like a bag of bricks, like so many others have. i found myself (and the audience) laughing my butt off one moment, and feeling very serious and engaged with the on-screen emotions the next. even when it happened abruptly, it still never felt inappropriate. now that's good entertainment. two thumbs up.

the actors all wear their roles like a custom-made suit. it's obvious that chris hemsworth has really grown into his character, third time around. this guy is thor, hands down. the same goes for all the other actors, they were all perfectly comfortable in their roles and respective environments. the one that intrigued me most, however, was loki – personified absolutely magnificently by tom hiddleston. much like hemsworth, it seems he was born to play this role. he captures all the slyness, all the arrogance and all the torment of a man almost unable to bear the weight of his own ego in a single flicker in his eyes. and then that grin… perfection. the way hiddleston plays loki is strangely captivating. you know he's totally wicked and cannot be trusted, yet at the same time you can't help but really like him – you might even end up rooting for this guy, and i'm not sure many other actors would have managed this.

all the special effects were as good as one should expect them to be these days. i have nothing much to say there, except that it was all terrifically eye-pleasing, and asgard looked even more beautiful than before. it was all convincing and very well done. 

still, i have not completely explained why t:tdw is better than the first. actually, i might not fully be able to. it's mostly a feeling. as much as i was entertained the first time, i was even more entertained now. it was more action-packed, more exciting, darker and it just had a great deal more adrenaline. 

the only thing that i think was weaker in this film, was the character of jane foster. her character was just less interesting, kind of blank. i actually don't remember much of her at all, except that she slapped thor a couple of times and she had all this creepy stuff coming out of her… also she was somewhat of a damsel-in-distress most of the time with the look of a scared kitten on her face, and that's not exactly how we like to see our ladies nowadays. it's so common to see women being perfectly independent now, that it's a little weird to see a grown woman with ""three degrees in physics"" (as darcy so poignantly points out) scared and shivering like a little girl. most of the time, natalie portman just didn't carry her scenes very strongly, and that's strange coming from such a fine actress. so maybe one of the actors was actually a little out of place after all, thinking about it. 

having said that, that's pretty much my only complaint. every other element in this film was very solid, the story was very good and they absolutely nailed the pacing. those two hours went by in the blink of a eye. 

thor: the dark world is wonderfully entertaining and a definite must-see for every marvel fan. in fact – at the risk of enraging the marvel gods – this might just be pretty stiff competition to x-men… watch out wolverine, i think i have a new favorite superhero.

3169,"**although forrest whitaker gives us another excellent performance, the script is not particularly good and ruins the film with unintelligent choices.**

this is one of those films that is largely based on the interpretation of the actors, who do the best they can with the material given to them and the instructions given by the director, philippe caland. the story told did not seem to have an exceptional relevance: it becomes quite predictable from the middle onwards and have some serious problems to consider.

so it's not surprising if i say that the best stuff here is the solid dramatic performance by forrest whitaker, an actor who has been on the rise since the beginning of the millennium and who has had a very promising career. this film is not one of his best, but his powerful and intense performance gives the film more interest. he is absolutely believable as a person in pain, disturbed, mentally unstable, but who has a heart and is not evil, although he is threatening in a convincing and brutal way. anthony mackie cannot keep up with him, but he also does a positive work. his character is denser than it seems at first glance, but this will only be understood as we see him interact with whitaker. despite a worthy attempt by sanaa lathan, we don't have a good supporting cast, and mike eps is particularly disappointing with his uninspired portrayal.

the script is based on the relationship between a visibly disturbed man and a therapist and author of self-help books, who accepts him as a patient despite not usually doing so. after all, he needs the money to help a bully brother. unfortunately, he doesn't seem to understand that this isn't the kind of help his new patient needs: the man is showing signs of psychosis or schizophrenia and needs a psychiatrist, not a guru of happy thoughts and tibetan meditation. this therapist, if he has any experience, should have understood this: instead, he continues and makes the situation worse by suggesting that he stop the medication, perhaps an antidepressant, that was prescribed. the rest are consequences.

honestly, i feel that this was enough to make a good film, even with the painful scenes that follow and that constitute the “core” of the film. the story of the car accident didn't need to be there. a disturbed man does not need a logical reason to attack, he just needs to lose his reason and self-control. giving an intelligible reason for whitaker's character's actions, in addition to being redundant, is weakening the character and turning him into a villain that he is not. this really ruined the film for me.

the film has many violent and bloody scenes, including tortures and high tension situations. it's not a film to watch with your eighty-year-old grandmother or the children. however, the suspense works effectively, and the tension grows as the end approaches. the good design of the sets (in particular the dilapidated house) and the cinematography help a lot to create this hostile and sinister environment.",low

when i say inconstancy, what i mean is that the film changes radically in the middle, for the worse: the script starts with a good initial premise, which is the death of the parents of the two children, who end up alone in a cabin in the woods. five years later, however, they are found again in a mental and psychological state that borders on the wild. however, and in the midst of the legal battle for their custody, it becomes evident to those who care for them that the two children have conversations with an invisible entity, which they call mama. intense and disturbing, the film creates an impactful situation, with characters that we can like and that hold us to the film. the supernatural situation is intriguing, and the creature created for the film is intimidating and truly terrifying. at various times, i noticed similarities with cinematographic works like _the exorcist_ and _the orphanage_. so far, all great.

the problem is that, roughly halfway through, the film loses its momentum, so to speak. it's as if the director had changed, or the film's idea had been different, or they were different films. everything becomes gradually more predictable, boring, uninteresting and tiring, and the scares and suspense gradually decrease. the creature, which before only appeared furtively and for a moment, is now fully visible, and that takes a lot of impact. the level of melodrama and sugar in the story also increases substantially. the end of the film is as unsatisfying as a sexual act interrupted midway because someone showed up at the wrong time. and i'd rather not talk about the various glitches of logic that start to appear, big as mansions, when we start to seriously think about all this!

the cast does what it can, and there are some efforts here that deserve to be highlighted. at the head we have two excellent child actresses, megan charpentier and isabelle nelisse, who do everything impeccably and authentically surrender to their characters. more than any adult, they are the ones who deserve to be highlighted in this film, for the way they lived it all and contributed to the final product. right after that, we have jessica chastain, who gives us yet another good, albeit imperfect, performance. i got the serious feeling that the actress wore a wig. if that wasn't the case, at least it looked like it. and she never seemed to fit that character well either. javier botet also deserves praise for the commitment and patience with which he put up with hours of make-up. the rest of the cast isn't so happy: daniel kash should have had more relevance in the plot, but we get the feeling that the character is dropped as quickly as possible, and nikolaj coaster-waldau wasn't used happily either, despite the talent and abilities of the actor.

technically, the film has several points of merit that are worth watching carefully. this is the case with cinematography. the entire film was shot excellently, with careful and meticulous work from the cameras. the sharpness, the shadows, the lighting work and the dark and sometimes washed-out colors accentuate, in certain scenes, the atmosphere of tension and abandonment that can be felt by the audience. the visual effects work quite well, especially everything about the creature, which only loses interest when we can see it well. a good choice of sets and costumes also helped, and the cgi is elegant and satisfying until you reach the middle of the film, where it clearly loses quality and impact.",low

could not gather my thoughts to write this review at the end of the movie.feeling really bogged down by some heaviness on my chest. thinking about the times in history when we actually used to do these atrocities on other human beings makes me cringe.to imagine waking up one day and find me in chains just because i'm a colored man and living my life like an unwanted child of god makes me question humanity altogether. just sitting through a little over than 2 hours and watching this movie made my heart bleed, i can't even begin to think of the people who lived their entire lives as slaves... 12 years a slave heart breakingly makes you feel the pain and suffering of almost the entire human kind at one point of time or other. direction by steve mcqueen is brilliant.chiwetel ejiofor plays a helpless slave in solomon northup to the hilt and also the small but impactive role played by brad pitt as a man with conscience is superb.lupita nyong'o's patsey too was depicted heart warmingly. you can't help but question yourself that how could man stoop such low and do these cruel acts and that too over such a prolonged period of time without even a single ounce of doubt in his mind for what he would have to pay for his actions.. all in all a gem of a movie showing one of the lowest point in human history !",high
3186,"utterly brilliant!

i haven't watched <em>'mary poppins'</em> itself in many, many years but still have memories of it as a kid. that meant i had the desired knowledge of the key parts about that film, which i'd say is probably wise to watch before this - though not a requirement, at least in my opinion.

ironically, travers' complaints about the animation segments to the 1964 film are justified on my end - i've been on a disney marathon since may, but to ""shorten"" the watch load i decided to only watch the studio's productions that are straight up animation or straight up live-action, so mp missed the cut given it's a combo. if she had her way, i'd have watched it again relatively recently. damn you, mr. disney!

anyway, <em>'saving mr. banks'</em> is an outstanding film! one that's filled with so much heart and some rich storytelling - loved the back and forth between travers' early and later years. they entwin the two films together very well, while the disney stuff - while in your face - adds humour as well as meaning.

then you have emma thompson and tom hanks. two actors i adore already. hanks plays walt disney very good, he's top notch in this. however, it is thompson that steals the show. she's superb as travers, who isn't the most likeable character but thompson ensures you stay invested in her. she's great in <em>'treasure planet'</em> and <em>'nanny mcphee'</em>, but this is the best i've seen from her so far.

elsewhere, shoutouts to colin farrell, ruth wilson and paul giamatti for what they bring - especially farrell. jason schwartzman and b. j. novak are good as the sherman brothers, also.

what impresses me the most about the music is that it manages to keep the storytelling alive whilst it occurs. particularly at the beginning there are loads of songs squeezed in next to each other, which could mess with the premise building but it doesn't - it actually enhances it. the songs themselves are terrific, with ""let it go"" obviously getting the most plaudits.

idina menzel (elsa) and kristen bell (anna) are excellent in the lead roles, while josh gad almost steals the show as olaf - very funny character! of course it's aimed at the younger audience members, but it is still entertaining for us adult folk too - i've watched it a few times down the years and still thoroughly enjoy it.",high
3214,"olympus has fallen ironically insults america’s national security through lunacy and patriotism. “die hard in the white house” claims british lads’ magazine zoo, divulging into the testosterone-fuelled minds of its laddish readers. to be fair to them, fuqua’s patriotic perspective of a national terrorist attack is exactly that. a ‘die hard’ rip-off that relies on the same narrative rhythms beat-for-beat. one man, and only one man, can save the day by gradually depleting the numbers of the antagonistic gang that harness either monetary or diplomatic motives. but where the aforementioned feature excelled, this action extravaganza flopped.

in apparently thirteen minutes, the entire secret service force is massacred at the hands of korean ultra-nationalists, at the white house, in the middle of the day. “the most secure building in the world” exclaimed one of the useless decision makers attempting to assist the acting president. yeah. that’s an armoury of irony right there. olympus has fallen is so unrealistic in plot, that for the majority of its runtime you’re left baffled as to how any of it was conceptualised. fully trained security guards joyfully skip towards barrages of bullets. protocols are broken left, right and centre. the frickin’ army chief of staff sends a fleet of armed helicopters into a danger zone despite already acknowledging the opposition acquiring a ridiculously overpowered turret. boom! dead. the lack of intelligence for its characters is, quite frankly, insulting. especially when this action blockbuster is supposed to be shrouded in patriotism.

the worst offender though is the obtuse amount of horrifically rendered visual effects. from blatantly obvious green screens to clunky polygonal helicopters floating around aimlessly. it was as if the team played ‘grand theft auto: san andreas’ and directly extracted the models from it. just woefully terrible. fortunately butler emanated his “tough guy” brutality in the central role, because he was continually stabbing koreans through the skull, throat and legs. a convincingly physical role that was perfectly suited to his acting style, enabling him to destroy his opponents whilst injecting some light buoyancy. unfortunately the screenplay is limited in the “fun” department, taking the narrative extremely seriously, which hindered the nostalgic cheesiness of 80s action blockbusters that fuqua took inspiration from.

speaking of, his directing style was taut as expected, with much focus on the shenanigans taking place within the presidential bunker. but the frenetic editing hindered his clarity. eckhart provided strength as the president, but as usual, picks lacklustre films to repress his talent. freeman shouted at one point and i quivered. bassett, mitchell and yune were underused and leo overacted. oh, and who stops a countdown at three seconds? let it go down to one! create that suspense for flip sake!

so yes, for thirsty action viewers who crave violence blended with one-dimensional characters, unintelligent plot points and obscene amounts of polygonal visual effects, olympus has fallen has got you covered. however, if you prefer your action blockbusters with an ounce of excitement, might i suggest a minuscule film called ‘die hard’?",low

it is being more a gamer's tale is what turned down. seeing the title, i anticipated something brilliant or mind-bender. though most of the film it was the main character who hold the joystick and try to achieve a scientific goal. the melanie thierry part was good. brought some cheers, but did not end properly. the film did not fare well among the film goers. mostly a mixed response. but i think it was a below average, especially coming from such a great director.

3224,"i have to say, or in this case write, that this was a fairly disappointing movie. it is pretty much a die hard wannabee with a daughter-dislikes-father sub-plot. i do not mind the reusing of the die hard concept if the film is good. this one is not really. the script is a stupid, unintelligent political script.

it starts off badly with some nonsensical crap about a controversial (that is putting it mildly) political deal with the middle east about pulling out troops from all the bases in the middle east. to add to this the entire situation have come about because the president just left several people to hang out and dry when he decided to pull the plug on operations in the middle east. by hanging out and dry we mean get killed or spend some quality time in the regional prisons. that put the president on the bad guy list instead of the good guy as far as i am concerned. i do not know if the writer was trying to make a political statement, which i never like in my movies, or is just plain stupid. given the rest of the script i would go for stupid or both.

the good thing with the movie is that there is quite a lot of action and some of it is rather okay to watch. there are a few funny moments as well. i quite liked the tour guide for example.

unfortunately, even if you try to forget about the political nonsense, the rest of the script is just full of utter stupidity. it starts of not too bad with the diversion at the capitol and the initial take over of the white house even though a whole bunch of armed, obviously unscreened, guys getting into the white house to work on the president’s home theatre like that is not very believable.

after that it gradually degrades though. cale is nowhere as charismatic, nor as professional, as mcclane and there are lots of silly and stupid moments. for example, the car chase starts of not too bad but then cale get’s into some bloody dream mode and gets shot up. just dumb. during the same episode the tank scene is just ridiculous. would they only have one tank? not very likely. it takes forever for it to move. it is also highly improbable that it could be taken out like that by a hand-held launcher by a front hit. rear or side maybe but not a front hit. the writer is obviously clueless about military matters. the fumbled chopper attack is embarrassingly bad. the worst is probably when cale’s daughter stops and air-strike by waving a flag outside the white house. i almost turned off the movie at that point.

it is too bad because the movie had the budget and some nice actors to be a good action movie but was just ruined by a louse script with a totally unnecessary bunch of political nonsense in it. the next time i see a movie were the script is written by james vanderbilt i am going to be very cautious.",low

i have enjoyed the eli roth's films, even though in some cases i've rated them lower than average rating it had received. but this is not what i was looking for. this is a terror-horror, not actual horror with supernatural or sci-fi viruses. i've learnt the storyline before the watch, but the film was too violent. even for most of the grown ups. usually i won't feel a thing for film tortures, because 'fake' is the word always pops up in my mind whenever i see gore.

anyway, these days, killings in the films are considered entertainment. there is a separate group of fans who follow this kind of theme. but for me, the cannibalism was the one most disturbed. i have no issue with killings, but cannibalism brings totally uneasy. the story was decent, but intentional. you would guess most of the parts. but this film was not about that, just to make you go off of your seat with discomfortable and it succeeds on that.

it was totally opposite to 'embrace of the serpent'. it was inspired by the 80s italian film with the similar storyline. the film was about fighting for the survival of passengers after their plane got crashed in the amazon forest who are now hunted by amazon tribes. there's already a sequel on making titled 'beyond the green inferno'. i don't think so, it is a recommendable film, but some are doing that for fun, and some to challenge their friends. overall, a decent production, with casting, locations and visuals. but i won't favour it.

there's a scene where streep and bridges get into the conversation of whether free will is worth the hurt and pain that comes with it.  it's 10 minutes of acting every one should watch.

the problem is this scene comes near the end of the movie and it's not enough to offset the other 100 minutes of complete blandness.  there isn't this sense of dread or tension in the movie at all.  there really isn't any sense of drama or pace to the movie and what results is a movie that feels like a late night documentary.

i'm tempted to blame the young actors on drawing the audience in but that's completely fair.  the film utilizes the voice of the main character - jonas - as its narrator.  while this is a quick way to give the film its voice, it also diffuses all the drama out of the film.  we know that the narrator 'makes it out okay' since he's telling the story.  

there are so many themes - free will, destiny, joy, war, hope, emotion vs. rationalism - that completely get overlooked because the narrator is trying to get us through the story instead of just inviting us into the story. as a result, there isn't any tension in the first act to make you care about any of the characters.",low

3273,"well, one off from two of this year's most expected movies alongside 'the battle of five armies'. like all the chris nolan fans, i was equally excited to see the movie on the opening day opening show. but i slightly disappointed that it was not a digital 3d film. i agree, this science-fiction was more dramatized than usual space travel stories does with an adventure-thriller. almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. get prepared for this extremely rare voyage into the space with a logical explanation for everything you see on the screen. well done research for the most matured and intelligent writing. all the credit must go to nolan brothers. a good sign from jonathan nolan, who can make big in the entertainment industry in a future like his brother.

as we know many had liked 'inception', to me that was a simple multi-layered action movie, that's all. but the same stuffs that used in this film makes sense. in fact, you have to have a little knowledge over how the universe works, so then it will be easy to catch the scene and situations while watching the movie. totally like a documentary style concept, but with the additional stuffs like characters and its emotions add flavor that gives a movie look. an educational movie, though it also can work for those who wants just entertainment. only the slow movie pace would test their patience.

it all begins like shyamalan's 'signs' movie with a family living surrounded by corn field. then switches to 'the astronaut farmer' and going through 'gravity', finally meets the 'inception'. it was just a reference to call the movie setting that brings constant change for every half an hour. like the opening scene and the end scene had over a 100 years difference.

as i earlier said it was the story of a family alongside the future of humankind and decoding universal mysteries through travelling in space and time. this movie would a reasonable for those who thought '2001: a space odyssey' is a boring piece, cleverly written cinematic piece especially for science geeks. i don't know how perfect the movie to the actual present astrophysics, but will justify for the common people's capacity of understanding with an encourageable amount of commercial elements in it to entertain as well.

the first three quarters of the movie was well made. it puts me in a unblinkable position like a story was narrated by brian cox in a television series. like i said, lots of astrophysics involved in it, but strangely human emotions were also exhibited equally that i never expected one from nolan film. it was not an ordinary sentiment, but was strong enough to make a man cry for happy and sad situations in the movie. i liked science and emotion coming together. in fact, it saved the movie, otherwise it would have been a science documentary straight from nasa production through nolan direction.

there are many surprise elements in the movie and of course there is a twist at the end. we can call it a series of twists like the layers. compared to last quarter of the movie to the rest, it completely detaches which opens broadly to the different directions. and that happens so fast rushing towards the other end. which give an impression of the movie 'inception'. in a perfect way to say the first 75% was 'the tree of life' and the remains are 'inception'.

‘‘this world's a treasure,
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.’’

all the actors were so good. matthew mcconaughey steals the show as he dominates the majority of the screen space in the story presentation. there's no ruling out the fine performance executions from anne hathaway and the young star from the twilight movie, mackenzie foy. the remaining cast was having less scope which were like the guest appearances that was widened a little broader, but was perfectly fitted for the story. especially matt damon's was the crucial one.

remember the movie 'contact', a lovely movie, which was ruined by its fictional ending. something like that happened in this film as well. the story was initiated with a realistic approach with actual scientific contents as per the present understanding about the universe. but the end was let me down with the layered contents that kind of impossible to agree with it. as a cinematic theme it worked, yeah, a good solution for this wonderfully written story. we know that the time can't run backwards, so that's the trouble.

anyway, this movie defines in a new way, i mean scientifically the existence of ghost. it was not a horror movie, but i liked supernatural force that merged with this science fiction theme. that explains and gives vast ideas to expand our physics beyond something and somewhere yet to reach. hats off to the director, because he was not thinking of making money here. his idea was to implement what the humans are understood so far about the cosmos. and he very nicely transformed those into the silver screen with the blend of human emotions. in my opinion, this will replace '2001: a space odyssey' for sometime till another one make this way.

i could have not asked a better space travel drama than this, especially when i heard nolan doing a science-fiction i believed he gonna rock it. he was so true to the science and the human feelings in this film. if you had seen enough movies before like this one, you can recall your memories like the tom hanks parts from 'cloud atlas'. but still independently stands strong and falls in a never seen before category.

‘‘maybe we've spent too long
trying to figure all this out with theory.’’

the end scene leaves a hint of a possible sequel. i would be happy if that happen in a near future, but definitely that would be a completely different cinema as per how this one ended. i know his fans want that to happen and so am i.

the visuals were not that great, but simply very good. to see those in digital 3d would have given us a different experience, sadly nolan was not in favor of that technology. hoping this movie would get as many as the oscars nod. especially not getting into the best motion picture shortlist would be a shame. like i said i'm no one fan, i just love watching everyone's every movie. i would have went to see it again if it was converted into digital 3d, since i'm modern tech geek when it comes to the films.

it will become a talk of the week, perhaps month all over the world, so don't leave behind when your friends talk about it. what i gonna say is it is a must see asap if you are a movie fanatic like me otherwise nolan movies does not need anyone's recommendation because his movies usually sell itself like the hot samosa.",high

i read hat his next movie is to be released in july 2017, i can't wait to find out everything about it like i have since he began.
if you're unsure about christopher nolan, watch his career from the beginning starting with doodlebug.",high
3276,"""man kind was born on earth, it was never meant to die here.""

it has been two days since i watched it and i still can't get it out of my head. i can safely say that it has been a long long time since a movie had this much effect on me after watching it. and the only thing i can think of now is to somehow re-watch it again.

this movie was surprisingly different from christopher nolan's recent works because they had been great cinematic entertainment pieces catered to a wider audience with a blockbuster approach, this certainly didn't felt like that and hence the polarizing response it got. it is an ambitious project that is not meant to merely entertain, walk into it knowing that. i'll say this though, if it works for you, you'll be in heaven.

the premise of the movie is that earth is no longer capable of supporting humans on it, we must find a new home to avoid extinction. this scenario is told from a very personal perspective and not from a global scale like some sort of apocalyptic catastrophe disaster film. at the core of the movie is the father-daughter relationship. the movie takes its sweet time to develop it too.

mathew mcconaughey, not surprisingly, gives an amazing performance as the main lead. he really carries the film, some scenes were very emotional due to his great performance. the rest of the cast does a great job as well, especially the daughter played by meckenzie foy. the one character that i never expected to be great was the robot tars. he also acted as the source of the humor in the movie, well executed, timely and grounded.

interstellar tackles a lot of themes, survival, humankind, love, time etc, out of which 'time' had the biggest impact on me. with relativity being a big part in the film, the whole sequence about it just struck me very deeply and i found new respect for time. i'm actually at a loss of words to describe it. also, there is a lot science in it so it can be confusing for many and in nolan's tradition, it also has twists and mind numbing ending, where the more you think about it, the more numbing it gets.

the visuals of this movie are breathtaking. great cinematography and cgi. the depiction of wormholes and blackholes and other space entities were the best i have ever seen. they just suck you into the movie. along with that, you get to listen to one of hans zimmer's best scores. the score not only felt personal, going perfectly with the movie, but also different from his recent works. there were times where combination of epic photography and soundtrack made the scenes timeless, like i was completely sucked into it and didn't had a clue about my surroundings. i didn't want those scenes to end.

alas, the movie was not perfect. my biggest gripe with it is that the pacing and editing was off at times. some scenes dragged on while others were cut far shorter. the beautiful views of space could have definitely benefited from a few seconds longer onscreen time. also, i wished there was more space exploration in it.

with all the remakes, rehashes, reboots and sequels we are getting in these times, it is great to see original gems like these. this movie is definitely one of this year's best, one of nolan's best work and one of the best movie i have seen in recent years.

9.5/10",high
3277,"this was my most anticipated film of 2014, and i was not disappointed. 

the story was slightly difficult to follow on the first watch, but that was to be expected in a film dealing with complicated fields such as astrophysics and time dilation. many didn't find its overall message - that love is the most powerful force in the universe which transcends space and time - to be very appealing, but i thought it was an interesting take on special relativity and how two people can be bound by a common feeling, even when they're in different parts of the universe at different times. i also thought the acting was believable, for the most part, and i didn't think anyone was miscast. i enjoyed the surprise appearance from a certain famous actor about halfway through.

but what really blew me away were the visuals and the soundtrack. i believe it was quentin tarantino who once said movies and music go hand in hand; that a moving image complimented by the right piece of music can create art. well, the visuals in this film, which took my breath away, and the score, which perfectly captured the 'feel' of the cosmos and all its wonder, proved him right. i think this was hans zimmer's best work yet, and although i'm not christopher nolan's biggest fan, i will continue to follow his work if he can pull off more movies like this. 

my only regret was not seeing this film in imax.

3278,"that this movie, at the time of writing this, holds an 8.8 rating at imdb is simply beyond my understanding. needless to say i did not really like this movie. the story is not very good, the science is ludicrous and the visuals not all that impressive. maybe the latter would be better in a big theater (i watched this on my home cinema system which has a relatively large screen by european standards) but i am not really sure about that either.

be warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.

the movie starts of with the usual “i told you so” wet dream of the green fanatics on a dying earth so it is off to a depressing start right away. that is an overused concept today as far as i am concerned. then they pour it on with a school official claiming that he apollo missions and moon landings never happened. what the f…? if they wanted to depress the audience right from the start they succeeded, at least with this audience.

the story proceeds with our heroes finding these gravity waves in the sand and by a huge stretch of imagination decrypts them to mean coordinates which leads them to the secret nasa base. once there cooper is told that he is their best choice of pilot for a “save the human race” mission through a wormhole. yeah, right! this guy was former nasa. his whereabouts could hardly been unknown to them. if he was their best choice why would they entrust a mission to save the human race to someone else until he stumbled onto their door? typical hollywood nonsense!

the movie is full of this kind of rubbish. romilly wastes 23 years of his life doing pretty much nothing except deciding not to go into the sleep capsule. the supposedly highly trained and vetted professor that they do find turns out to be a psychopath as well as and idiot almost blowing up the ship when trying to proceed with a docking that all the systems tells him have not succeeded. then they proceed to dock with the main ship and stop its spin as well as bring it out of orbit around a planet with the shuttles engines. that is one hell of a powerful shuttle not to mention the strength of the docking mechanism! this just goes on. when someone is not doing something illogical or stupid (or both) they sit around talking, philosophizing and dragging the movie forward at snails pace. 169 minutes is way too much for this movie.

the movie ends up in one big time travel mess (okay they do not travel in time, just sends messages through time but still…) during a bunch of psychedelic scenes while traveling through the back hole. science? not so much. and what about this totally ludicrous massively illogical and inefficient robot design?

the one good thing i can say about this movie is that the performance of most of the actors, especially matthew mcconaughey, are quite good. for the rest, not my cup of tea.",low

the story is about a team of explorers undertakes the most important mission in human history; traveling beyond this galaxy to discover whether mankind has a future among the stars.

christopher nolan once said that 2001: a space odyssey was his all time favorite film and how he wanted to do a small tribute to he's next film. and then comes a movie called ""interstellar"" that will put a smile on kubrick face if he was alive today, because interstellar is one of the best movie of 2014 and the best movie experience i've had at the cinema.

i saw this movie in imax and all through out this film i felt like i was in space floating around with mconaughey and anne hathaway. i had that feeling that i was going deep into space just like are main character's, going deep into space just like the viewing auditions and me.

the visual effect's in this movie are some of the most stunning, beautiful and jaw dropping effect's i've seen since 2001: a space odyssey. the performances were brilliant, the cinematography was breathtaking and hard to look away. the directing by christopher nolan and let me get this out there, this man is a true director; he knows cinema and knows how to interested people into seeing he's films and i'm still shocked that he hasn't won an oscar yet.

now most people or critics have said that last third of this movie ruined the movie for them, but i actually like the ending to the movie. it's new for nolan because he always ends on a deep and cold note, but this movie didn't and i didn't mind it.

my only nick pick with the movie is some of the character's in this movie wasn't all that interesting. matthew mcconaughey, anne hathaway and jessica chastain are the only character's that to me were interesting and i cared for them, but the rest of the character's i didn't really care for.

overall interstellar is a mind-blowing movie with fantastic visual's, interesting story line and the movie will keep you interested till the end.",high
3282,"i will not add another in depth review to the several i see here on this movie. nor will i try to evaluate the accuracy of the science behind the plot. apparently a physicist was involved who had veto power if the script wandered out of the realm of what is at least theoretically true or possible.

but i have never let inaccuracies get in the way of enjoying science fiction movies anyway, as long as the movie is entertaining and otherwise doesn’t insult my intelligence. in the movie monsters, for example, i read that giant the aliens looking like octopuses could not have walked upright. fair enough, but it is entertainment, not a documentary.

so the human story of interstellar held my attention in spite of the length of the film, and despite the elaborate special effects, that story drove the movie and my appreciation of it. i have always liked good time travel movies as well, and theories of space and time come into play in interstellar as well.

3290,"bram stoker's count dracula is textbook example of my evil iceberg theory (the less you see of and know about a villain, the better). in an epistolary novel, the title character is the only one who doesn’t set his thoughts down in letters or in a diary (or, like dr. seward, a phonograph recording). 

if, as lovecraft wrote, ""the oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown,"" then dracula is the embodiment of this fear; inscrutable, unknowable, unreachable, impossible to negotiate or reason with. 

moreover, it’s futile to try to assign him complex motivation; like the shark in jaws or dr. lecter, the count kills to feed — no more, no less. taking all this into account, it's easy to see how bad an idea dracula untold really is.

the story is narrated — a long time after it took place, though oddly in the same childlike voice the narrator had when the events trasnspired — by ingeras (art parkinson), son of vlad iii draculea, aka the impaler, aka son of the dragon, aka son of the devil, aka dracula; let's just call him vlad (luke evans). 

""in the year of our lord 1442, the turkish sultan enslaved 1,000 children from transylvania to fill the ranks of his army."" one of these children grew up to become vlad, who ""disgusted by his monstrous deeds ... buried his past with the dead and returned to transylvania to rule in peace."" so vlad just took his ball and went home. just like that, no revolt required. someone should tell the sultan how slavery really works.

this notwithstanding, wallachia and transylvania remain under ottoman rule, and vlad must pay an annual tribute to sultan mehmed ii (dominic cooper); one can't help wondering why these two peoples are so hostile to each other, especially seeing how they share the lingua franca of british english. 

mehmed takes it upon himself to 'enslaving' a thousand other children (perhaps the first thousand just walked away like vlad?), including ingeras. vlad refuses, and knowing that this means war, goes to a cave in a mountain to seek help from ""a vampire. from the greek word pi, to drink [actually 'pi' is a greek letter; the language in which it is a word that means 'drink' or 'suck' is albanian]. the beast was once a mortal man who summoned a demon from the depths of hell to barter for his dark power. the demon deceived the man, granting his wish, but his price was an eternity condemned to the darkness of that cave, where he remains until he finds another to free him.""

the cave vampire (charles dance), who once was a roman and thus speaks, like all romans do in the movies, the queen's english, gives vlad a sip of his blood, and with it “a taste of my power. the strength of 100 men. the speed of a shooting star. domain of the night and all its creatures. see and hear through your senses. even heal grievous wounds ... once you drink, your thirst for human blood will be insatiable. but if you can hold out for three days, you will return to your mortal state having tasted my power, and perhaps saved your people. [what if i feed?] i will be freed having granted the darkness a worthy offering. you will become … like me. a scourge on this earth destined to destroy everything you love… i, however, will be free to unleash my wrath against the one who betrayed me. and one day, i will call upon you to serve me, my pawn, in an immortal game of revenge.""

all this does is show that sometimes no explanation is the best explanation. let's compare coppola’s dracula, in whose introduction — featuring modern romanian dialogue with medieval english syntax (perhaps not historically correct but still much better than english-english) — gary oldman plunges his sword into the stone cross of a chapel, and drinks the blood that flows from it. 

this doesn't necessarily make any more sense, but at least it's short and to the point, and coppola has the good sense to not even try to explain it. 

conversely, all of dracula untold’s heavy exposition only raises more questions than it answers. how did this roman guy end up in transylvania? are there no caves in rome? why can't he leave the cave and vlad can? what exactly does ""an immortal game of revenge"" mean? this phrase simply reeks of oxymoron.

speaking of coppola, he was the second to make the character of dracula and the historical dracula one and the same person, and add a reincarnation romance to the plot (the first was dan curtis in his own 1974 bram stoker's dracula, written by richard matheson). 

director gary shore and screenwriters matt sazama and burk sharpless repeat the formula in dracula untold, but their mistake is making an entire movie out of this premise. if they had done their homework, they would know that the link to vlad iii is tenuous at best, and that the real and probably only reason stoker used the name 'dracula' is because he was under the mistaken impression that it meant 'devil' in romanian (but who knows; maybe the confusion of ' greek pi' with albanian 'pi' was a tribute to this linguistic faux pas on the irish author’s part).",low

3303,"richard linklater's 'boyhood' is a brilliant film about life and the struggle to find meaning. it follows a family through a twelve year period as they endure situations and tackle obstacles together. the main technical aspect of the film is a very controversial and memorable one as linklater hired his main actors and continued to follow them for twelve years thus adding to the realism of the feature adding much poignancy to the themes. the overall direction can be considered very naturalistic and simple but there are wonderful shots of natural environments such as the beautiful river that mason and his father visit representing the beauty of life whilst underlining the insignificance of man's role in the world.

the screenplay is a touching study of the meaning of life. there is a great balance of humour and heart-rending dialogue throughout the film. at 165 minutes, the movie is a long one but the pacing was perfect and captivating that i hardly noted the film's duration. the characters each have profound dialogue in which they discuss the journey of which they (and we) are going through and question the reasoning of difficult events.

the performances in 'boyhood' are exceptional. mason (ellar coltrane) starts off as relatively inexperienced and under-developed but matures as the film progresses adding substance to his character's arch. this performance is supported by the excellent patricia arquette who plays the mother. arquette manages to portray the mother perfectly as she undergoes traumatic events that shape her family's life.

overall, i feel that 'boyhood' is a technically brilliant achievement in film-making. not only is the process fascinating in terms of the methods used to create the film but it is also a fascinating investigation into time.

3321,"**a very expensive video game made for people who have never been to war, without any basis in true historical facts, and which almost insults the history of greece.**

a few years ago, i wrote a short text for the movie “300”, which i found repugnant and an insult to anyone who knows the slightest bit about greek history. unfortunately, frank miller's graphic novels show that, for him, history is not important. i didn't expect these films to be documentaries, but the amount of exaggeration and absurd anachronisms is unbearable. when i studied greek history in college, i had to read a very complete book on the subject (among others, but this one particularly impressed me). i would love to be able to use it to slap miller and the producers of this movie.

the great – and only – redeeming quality of this film is its visual exuberance, achieved at the expense of colossal amounts of cgi to great effect, which amplify the fight scenes to the extreme and give the film the appearance of an extremely expensive video game. the use of slow-motion and some sound effects serve to amplify the battle and give it a glorious, choreographed, fake look. i usually say that only those who have never had to participate in a war will like war... after seeing such homoerotic attraction for war, and for naked athletic bodies spurting blood, i am pretty sure that, in this film, very few went through a real war.

sullivan stapleton and eva green are the only two actors who deserve some attention here, and this is due to the protagonism of their characters, fictional and carnivalesque versions of two historical characters: themistocles and artemisia. lucky for both actors, there wasn't much concern to be historically accurate: themistocles and artemisia were older than these two actors. he was, above all, an athenian politician with a lot of public experience at the time of the events of this film, while she was a queen, the widow of the satrap of caria. and contrary to what the movie says, she didn't command the persian fleet, although she was one of the main commanders.

as i said, the film is full of historical inaccuracies: the persian wars began with the annexation of lydia by cyrus the great, persia's first achaemenid monarch. included in the conquest were the cities of ionia, culturally greek and subject to lydia. they tried to separate with the support of athens, but emperor darius won them, going against the athenians. it is then that themistocles appears, defending the creation of an athenian fleet capable of facing the persian, and that marathon is won, the work of his political rival miltiades. darius dies (of natural causes, forget the movie) and xerxes succeeds him. this was followed, as is known, by the battle of thermopylae, where more than 1,400 greeks died (and not just the famous 300). at the same time, the battle of artemisium was fought on the seas, in which themistocles stopped the persian fleet. xerxes makes his way to athens, which is hastily evacuated by sea before the persians sack and burn the city. it is themistocles who then decides to pretend to be a traitor and suggest to xerxes a decisive attack on the greek fleet in the bay of salamis. there, under cover of a tight bay, the quality of the greek ships proved decisive.

what gave the greeks victory was not glory, empty heroism, muscles or six-pack abs. what gave them victory was intelligence, choosing able leaders when it was vital, and choosing military tactics that well balanced the invader's numbers. there were many persians, but their troops were no match for the greek phalanx covered in steel (they didn't fight in underpants, as the film shows!): unlike the greeks, the persians didn't wear metal armour, they had shields made of plaited wicker and carried, essentially, archers, slingers, short-spear spearmen and a lot of cavalry. likewise, the persians had a lot of ships, but their quality was very poor when compared to the athenian and corinthian galleys. the greek victory was essentially a triumph of technique and intelligence over brute force and numbers. and this movie doesn't tell us about that.",low
3333,"today, june 4, i went to see maleficent on the birthday of its star, angelina jolie. in itself, nothing more than a funny coincidence, although when you think about it, it is customary for someone who is celebrating their birthday, to hand out treats. and boy, this was the best treat ever.

three reasons why i was completely stoked to see maleficent after hearing about it for the first time about a year and a half ago: 1) i love angelina. 2) i love sleeping beauty. 3) maleficent is my favourite fairy tale villain of all time. on the other hand, i was also a little wary of the way they had apparently altered the story. see, if there is one thing i hate in films, it's when they explain and justify the motives and reasons why a certain character is ""bad"". i for one believe that some people are just plain evil and that's the way it is. and going into this persons' childhood and explaining how bad everything was (or something to that effect) only works to weaken that characters' force. now, i don't know why a somewhat clichéd story about the love and betrayal of a young maleficent (who apparently used to be good and pure-hearted), worked here, but somehow it just did. it completely surprised me, to be honest. i'm usually allergic to this kind of fluff, but it worked! maleficents' back-story actually intrigued me, moved me even. and it succeeded at what it was supposed to do in the first place: it made maleficent human.

in the end though, they could have written any kind of story about what is undoubtedly disney's most beloved villainess, it never would have been raised to an above-par level without its most crucial element: angelina jolie. i might sound biased because i'm such a fan, but i am perfectly able to look at her performances in a critical way, and i can only say this about her performance as maleficent: she was in one word, perfect. i honestly can't imagine any other actress who could have approached this role with the same flawless combination of properties (short of maybe charlize theron): she is beautiful and very charismatic, yet at the same time undeniably cruel and cold. she was everything i had hoped this real life characterization of maleficent would be, and then some. 

compliments also go out to the three other main actors in this film. first to elle fanning, for being very convincing as the young princess aurora. she is sweet, lovely and kind and she has the right personality to play this famous princess just the way she should be. second, to sam riley, who was a pleasant surprise as maleficents' pet raven diaval in human form. i was thus far unfamiliar with his work, but he was very well suited to his role and i enjoyed watching him. last, but certainly not least, sharlto copley, who has already thrilled me with his performances in district 9 and elysium, and who has now definitely made a fan out of me. his range is awesome and he was totally terrifying as stefan.

ok, there are some things you have to look past. my first, and most blatant, issue with this film is: if young maleficent was a good, pure- hearted girl, then why did she, as an innocent 10-year-old, already have evil-looking horns, devilish wings and is she called ""maleficent""? right… secondly, i found the three pixies to be very unconvincing and even somewhat annoying cgi-wise. overall the special effects are well done but the pixies were definitely an eyesore. the dragon in the end also looked a bit unreal. 

that being said, maleficents' costumes and make-up were absolutely stunning. i just couldn't get enough of gazing at her intricate headdresses and beautiful gowns. the costume and styling department really deserve top credit and i truly hope there will be some awards for them in the near future. the music was also great, with flawless scoring by james newton howard and a terrific rendition of ""once upon a dream"" by lana del rey over the end credits. also, awesome battle scenes and action sequences galore!

going into this film, i thought it would be nothing more than a so-so, kind of fun summer flick. a 6.5/7 maybe. sometimes, i love it when i'm wrong. out of the three films that i've seen at the cinema over the last week (the other two being x-men and godzilla, both disappointments…) i can tell you, maleficent was by far the most gratifying. perhaps because i had relatively low expectations, perhaps because it was simply that good.

one serious warning for the rough, rugged men out there: this film features pixies, fairies, sparkly thingies and magical fluff out the wazoo. if you're going to see this, do it for angelina. if not, treat this film like kryptonite. you will thank me later.

to everyone else: go see this film. it will rock your socks off. maleficent is magnificent.

an enchanting retelling of a classic story which really holds it's own with the changes in it's story-line. if you love magical worlds, definitely give this one a watch! (7/10 on the dragon-scale for including two very badass dragons!)_

i truly appreciate the modern trend of humanizing the ""villains"" in a story, real life is rarely as simple as: 'this person is just evil.' and it allows for so much more depth and emotional investment in both protagonists and antagonists.

hats off to the visual effects team for making the moors feel truly enchanted, with many magical critters and beautifully strange fauna all pining for your attention. everything feels like it has it's own personality through their movement and design, making the whole movie a feast for the eyes. (and i of-course cannot forget the raven-like aspects in all of diaval's forms. raven dragon? yes please!)

as for the story, it takes great inspiration from the original but brings it's own charms to the table. opting to take the 'parental love' definition of true love, rather than romantic love. which is a decision i personally can get behind. (even _if_ maleficent is not aurora's birth-mother, she has certainly been more of a mother to her than her biological mother. which is another great message to send!)

lastly, what did i get out of the story? when we're young, we tend to be young, naïve and have an optimistic colorful view of the world. and something will inevitably happen to change our views and jade us. (making our outlook darker and thornier. _wink wink nudge nudge._) 

this new outlook will usually stay for years, if not for life, but sometimes we find something or someone who revives (part of) the child we all have inside of us that we wish dearly to protect. (the moors going from colorful to dark and back to colorful again.) and i can certainly find myself in that.",high
3341,"where to start with this movie, with **frank**? should i start with describing the man inside the giant head, or maybe the very head itself? i could also try and describe the plot, or maybe the music, the weird wonderful nonsense that frank sprays from inside the head? no, perhaps it would be even better to start with the actor playing the man inside the giant head, or maybe the entire cast, who tries to cope with their friend, the world and their own problems?

actually, i think i might start here, with myself. i mean, who of us haven't felt like hiding inside a giant head? and yet, i am not sure that if i ever did hide inside a giant head, that i would be able to lifv as normally as frank actually does. to him, the head actually helps make him more human, or maybe just... human. thunk about it for a second, frank is wearing a giant head, and not just while he is on the stage, singing, no this guy wears his head all the time, even when he is sleeping or taking a bath. and we accept it, in fact, while i watched the movie, i found myself hoping that he would never be forced to take it off. we simply don't need to know what is inside, because frank is the head.

ok, let me try and break the plot down for you without giving too much away. a young man (domhnall gleeson) wants to make his own music, but honestly, he is beyond bad, he would need a miracle to break through in the music industry. that miracle comes one day, when a band arrives at his small village, sonorpfbrs. apparently the keyboard player wants to kill himself, which leaves a spot open for jon (the young man). they manage to almost play a whole song before the band breaks up, in chaos. this is not your average punk band, but something a bit more... out there.

the guy goes home, thinking that he wasted his one chance, but then one day, the manager (scoot mcnairy) calls him again. they are going to ireland to record an album. the young man packs his back, thinking that he will be there for a day, but really, it ends up being closer to a year, and he ends up spending all his money to keep the band going. they have secluded themselves in the wilderness, and here jon gets to learn the stories of all the bandmembers. frank might be the one with the big fake head, but trust me, all the members have their own mental problems.

no more plot for you, but you see where this is going. everyone needs to figure out who they are, and if they really need to hide inside giant heads, big beards or nasty and unwelcoming personalities.

once the movie gets going, this is actually a less weird movie than i had expected, and that is not a bad thing. there is enough weirdness here for a lifetime, but there is also something very human here, and that is what drives the movie forward. frank, of course, is the soul of the movie, and played with perfect execution by michael fassbender. and yet, the rest of the cast acts with the same careful precision as frank, living their life on a knife's edge. you simply feel as if they could tip over at any moment and escape reality completely. maybe i should also note here that no drugs are involved whatsoever, these guys are as clean as snow, they just have... issues.

last words... original, and yet, not as original as i had thought (or maybe even feared). the story here is one we've seen in many movies, but the package is just... so much better. don't try and overthink it, just sit back and listen. if you are lucky, you might just learn a thing or two about yourself.",high

3364,"**a hopeless mess from start to finish, unfortunately.**

this is not a good film, not even to watch with your buddies while drinking beer (which i did). it has some promise in its premise, and at one point we actually wanted to know how the actual betrayal was done, but that feeling soon vanished.

i personally think that arnold does a decent job with what he has to work with, the rest of the actors are pretty atrocious though. sam worthington is the best of the rest but that isn't saying much. pair this with some of the most clichéd, over-the-top, obnoxious personalities ever put on film and sprinkle some next level cringeworthy dialogue on top and you have a recipe for characters you will actively despise. we actually cheered when they got killed off.

the biggest flaw of the movie is the editing though. as i mentioned we really wanted to be invested in this movie but either the director or the editor was really hung-over - or possibly still drunk - when they cut this movie. multiple scenes and situations made less than no sense, and the final nail in the coffin was the realization that the inciting moment, the very reason the entire movie exists, was so badly edited that none of us understood what actually had happened until it was explained by a character much later.

the final ten minutes of the movie made it painfully clear that it wouldn't have mattered if we had understood it, or anything really, as the ""twist"" (i wish i could use even bigger quotation marks) is both underwhelming and as twisted as metal ruler. you get no explanation of how the betrayal is done, no explanation why the events that are portrayed in the movie ever take place, nor why the characters act the way they did.

honestly though, it's our own fault to expect any sort of arc or depth to characters that probably has fewer than two lines of description in the script. it made for some relatively entertaining moments though when all of a sudden characters acted even more erratic and confusing than usual. it became a game of sorts to try and figure out if this was because one or more scenes were cut or if the writer/director actually was that incompetent.

the one redeeming quality of this movie is that they took their blood and splatter of said blood seriously. there are a couple of almost intense moments solely due to some realistic gore. there isn't enough to entice any fans of gore and splatter to watch this though.

the humor works in best possible dry as a martini kind of way, and it's played straight like comedy should be.

but really, the premise sold me. take a hard boiled film noir kind of mystery and replace sam spade with the perpetual stoner and then watch him try to solve a mystery.

it's incoherent enough to make you believe that doc is just a little too rocked to function properly most of the time, which is reflected in his effectiveness and decision making skills. he's smart enough to not bumble his way through it, but has gotten off the magic school bus enough to do his best possible work.

and it makes the film do that one singular thing that all movies are required to do in order to be called a success... it entertains.

it's difficult to grasp just what the makers were going for since the film goes nowhere fast and quickly loses focus to the point that nothing much makes sense. it starts off promising enough, with a nice musical score and some nifty location photography work. then it piles on the exposition, throws in some poor acting, all building towards a laughable finale that is most certainly not worth waiting for - and again the reveal doesn't make any sense given what had happened earlier in the piece.

if you think it is some b movie, which is overrated, i would say your assumption is totally wrong. i did not know anything about this film either, i thought it was a christian bale movie, that's who i saw in the poster, but later i came to know it was a different guy. my thought on this changed after watching it, it is really a beautiful drama-music. one of the best films of the 2014 that i would have missed it if i had listened to the lies of the critics. so be careful while choosing such movies, because critics are not always right.

i believe you all had seen enough films based on the school shootings like 'elephant'. this is a similar kind, except there's no violence in it, i mean the shootout was not shown, but a drama about its consequences, especially in the perspective of the parents. this tale focused on a father whose son had been killed in a such unfortunate event. how it affects his life was narrated wonderfully with some awesome music tracks. a father's mourning and his uncertain future to the self-discovery.

this is willian h. macy's directional debut film and he pulled it off quite superbly. sadly, nobody talks about it in the line of other great films of the year, because it deserves an equal respect and praise. i am not the only one, there are others too who liked it a lot. a simple story and the perfect character exhibitions with the pleasing musics, all these worked in its favour. supporting roles are enough, billy crudup should do more lead roles. after seeing his impressive performance in this i am confident that he can find his own place in the industry. and so willian h. macy, i'm looking forward for his future projects.

> ""there are 14 people in the audience and 10 of them are performers.""

it was not inspired by the real story, except the school shootings, but the film incredibly told what happens after such incidents. the best part was balancing the emotions in the storytelling. after watching it in the first 10 minutes, i expected, in fact anybody expects it to be a tearjerker film, but it was not, even though i loved watching the rest of the film. and the twist was very casual which was not meant for the story or the characters, but for the viewers that related to the school shooting that we never saw. so there is a less possibility for us to expect it coming, but it also that brings a better conclusion to the heartwarming tale.

it was like someone's real life, yet not easy to predict the scenes. cinematically it accomplished its quest to be a good film. selena gomez was in a guest role, but for a star like her it was unnecessary to play a small part, especially in a serious theme like this. because unexpected anticipation grows in us and in the end that might lead to a disappointment, especially for her fans. that is not for her alone, but any other big stars, because it is not a comedy or a superhero film when they appear on the screen, the audience to go crazy. a character with the dialogues means something big, but anyway, she was bad at all.

it wasn't as good performance as anton yelchin's previous film '5 to 7' that i saw early this year, but yeah definitely a decent supporting character along with laurence fishburne's. don't mistake it, it was not a powerful drama about grieving alone, but in its small specific expanse it reached what it wanted to tell the audience so perfectly. so, there are some fun parts as well in it in a small quantity. but overall, a film that fulfills its promise. by now you might know that i strongly recommend it, especially if anyone who had ever lost their loved ones, they will feel it in their heart more than others do.

as the blurb states, our hero is meeting a few adaptation issues after having been awaken into the modern world. luckily the movie do not fall into the trap of making some silly comedy out of it but keeps these parts at a reasonable level where it stays funny without ruining the movie or disrupting the pace of the real story.

the story? simple and not very original with the usual slew of traitors strewn about, you cannot trust anyone, our hero becomes a fugitive etc etc bla bla bla. it is however a pretty straightforward one which works quite well and is not getting bogged down in silly emotions and general idiotic behavior by our hero like for instance several instalments of spider man have done. actually this is one thing that i really like with this movie. the hero is a true hero from start to finish without any of that modern hollywood crap where the hero must be tarnished in one way or another to satisfy the directors and producers.

as i wrote above if you like superhero action movies then there is little not to like with this one. acceptable story, plenty of action, good special effects, a cool chick (hey i am but an ordinary male, i like female actors in tight costumes) and a clear hero. none of the actors are really doing a bad job of it and in general the acting is as good as one can expect when portraying characters that, after all, are be totally ludicrous in real life. its 8 out of 10 rating at imdb (at the time of writing this) is well deserved. i am astonished that some people seem to have voted it down with a one star rating. it is a marvel-based movie. you might feel it is more or less good but the style of the movie should not really be a major surprise to anyone and there is no way in hell that it deserves a one star rating unless someone really watched the wrong movie by accident.",high

stonking! now this is more like it, after the disappointments that have been iron man 2 and thor 2, captain america gets a sequel of substance and sparks. it manages to blend everything required to make a great superhero film, lashings of derring-do heroics, action bonanza, adventure, some sexy sizzle and of course the key, a story with brains and mystery elements.

true enough to say that the considerable contributions of black widow and falcon (and nick fury of course) keeps this as a lively avengers spin-off movie, which is no bad thing at all, but it's still the captain who dominates things, marking himself out as a viable main man. in fact the whole film has the old school comic book feel, yes there's the grandiose pyrotechnics - unsurprisingly amped up for the big finale, but there's an adherence to serial thriller conventions that is, well, rather warm and comforting.

with the captain getting some surprising amount of emotional depth and humanity courtesy of the perfectly cast chris evans, the viewers have much to care about. themes of bondian world domination and global security crisis keep things nice and fanciful, while the unheralded work by the effects guys is modern cinematic art. there's some adherence to genre formula, and a bit of marvel universe copy-catting going on, but this is one of the best films from the marvel stable. a rich sequel indeed - more captain america please. 9/10",high
3391,"**a long format review from 2014**

misleadingly, the titular winter soldier is essentially a minor subplot in what is more of an espionage-technoir-thriller meets spectacle-epic than your typical super hero film. the real meat of the movie, thankfully, has some more substance behind it. though it wouldn't surprise me if we learn later that sebastian stan's villain was forced to take a back seat via last minute script changes à la hawkeye in _the avengers_.

these things are of course a matter of opinion, and i'd like to watch _winter soldier_ at least once more (particularly in 2d... god do i ever hate 3d) before committing to any particular ranking. but even without that, i feel confident in saying it's the best mcu phase 2 film to date. we must await _guardians of the galaxy_ and _age of ultron_ before cementing that little award, but i'd say that it stands at the very least above _iron man 3_ and _the dark world_.

i always try to keep my reviews spoiler free, but being that in most parts of the world it isn't out yet, i'll be extra careful to do so with this one. this makes talking about _winter soldier_ on its own merits difficult, but there are certainly a few things that can be said.

chris evans (cap'), scarlett johansson (black widow) and to a slightly lesser extent. anthonie mackie (falcon) rule the film, and do so without any shortcomings. that's not to say that they couldn't physically have done any better, but their roles were all seamless as far as my blurred vision could tell, which is not an accolade i'd often give.

where _the dark world_ was simply a holding pattern for thor with some very pretty pictures, _iron man 3_ and _the winter soldier_ went out and took some actual risks in their stories. but unlike _iron man 3's_, winter soldier's risks have (to its eternal credit) been universally well received.

directors joe and anthony russo also managed to cameo a couple of community alumni, which will never be a bad thing in my eyes, even if they're just one-off, throwaway jokes.

as i said, i really feel i need to give _the winter soldier_ at the very least one more screening before i feel totally confident in my thoughts about it.

but the fact that i'm really fucking excited for that second viewing speaks in its favour if nothing else does.

this is easily one of the best x-men films because of the interesting plot and the focus on the most interesting characters. wolverine (hugh jackman) has been the top x-men since day one so you can't go wrong with making him the focal point. james mcavoy and patrick stewart are excellent as professor x, as are michael fassbender as young magneto, jennifer lawrence as mystique and evan peters as quicksilver, the latter in a small but highly entertaining role. nicholas hoult as beast gets an honorable mention and bingbing fan is notable as blink, particularly her stunning face. 

the plot is convoluted and yet easy to follow if you're familiar with the franchise's story arc. the film is all-around compelling. it has the confidence to slow down and be pensive while throwing in the requisite thrills and not forgetting to be entertaining. for instance, the creative and amusing way quicksilver takes down a bunch of security guards at the pentagon, which is one of the movie's top scenes. lastly, i like the way magneto’s great power is illustrated (you’ll see what i mean).

3418,"watching noah, it occurs to me that it must have been made by atheists. after all, they are treating the word of god  as little more than a first draft. 

on the other hand, though, co-writer/director darren aronofsky isn’t fucking around with the old ""thou shalt not take the name of the lord your god in vain,"" making sure to substitute the g word with the epithet ""the creator."" 

thus, noah (russell crowe) tells his wife naamah (jennifer connelly) that “[the creator] is going to destroy the world” (after which he will presumably be known as “the destroyer”) by way of a flood, which may have given rise to the expression 'when it rains it pours;' i mean, the characters are already living in a post-apocalyptic wasteland; destroying it would certainly qualify as overkill.

noah turns to his grandfather methuselah (anthony hopkins) for advice — by the way, according to the bible, noah invented wine, but what the good book doesn’t say is that methuselah invented tea; the latter is a miracle in itself, since water and leaves, the two essential ingredients to prepare this beverage (not to mention the fuel needed to start a fire and the kindle to keep it burning), are entirely conspicuous by their absence. 

luckily, methuselah has a magical seed that can grow an entire forest overnight, but which he had apparently been saving to give to noah. noah uses the wood from the trees in this forest to build the ark, which follows the field of dreams principle; i.e., 'if you build it, they will come' — 'they' being two of each animal, all of which without exception clearly belong to the computatrum generatae genus, but then the visual effects are one of the few pleasures to be had here; in particular the “watchers” (fallen angels turned into semi-anthropomorphic rock formations voiced by frank langella and nick nolte, among others), as well as the montage that accompanies noah's narration of genesis.

additionally, the ark itself and the accompanying flood are not unimpressive, and i like how aronofsky has noah's sons succumb to rapid aging syndrome to indicate the passage of the many years it would take to complete such a gargantuan project.

the problem with this is that they grow up to be emma watson, logan lerman, douglas booth, etc., all of them with impossibly perfect hair, skin, and teeth (unless, of course, methuselah also invented shampoo and toothpaste, in addition to tea).

all things considered, however, the real highlight of the film is ray winstone's performance as tubalcaín. winstone is nominally the villain, but his character is really the most sensible of all (and winstone’s delivery lends eve more weight to his convictions), correctly pointing out that both the creator and the proto-david koresh that crowe plays noah as — although his madness is justifiable; ""if the noise of all those animals didn't drive noah insane (not to mention the insect bites), the smell should have killed him"" (the skeptic’s dictionary) — have become drunk with power.",low

based on the real life events of the director's childhood and it is her first directional film as well. mark ruffalo and zoe saldana as her onscreen father and mother respectively, while her character as a 12 year old girl was played by her own daughter. i think it was a great team, the mother is the director, the daughter performing under her, the father producing it and it is their story.

i was worried that this film's going to emotionally hurt me as i'm an easy target to strike with a theme like this as what the synopsis says and the trailer revealed. but i was prepared for that, i wanted to have a tearjerker flick and in the end, i had a great time with it as the fulfillment was way beyond than what i was expected.

it was the story of a small family, a father and a mother and their two little girls that set in the 1978 bostan city. because of the condition of the father, the struggling family whose children are growing up needs a financial support for their better education and care. so the mother decides to sacrifice a few years of hers to go back to college to graduate and get a job. now its between the father and the girls, how they spend those years together, which will be their worst nightmare as well as the best years of their lives.

> ""we'll be braver, daddy.
> next time, i promise we'll be braver.""

it really scared me a few times, because of the temperament of the father character, kids playing with a machete and so on. a wonderful family flick, but only for the adult members. because of the too much cigarette smoking, i mean mark ruffalo smoked almost all in his screen presence and obviously the excessive usage of the foul language is the other reason.

so it is an r rated flick, but it was so perfect, the 70s atmosphere was spot on. except the only bothering thing was the children never grew physically, while the cars, clothing style, society, cameras, the timeline has kept changing. but it did not leap extremely forward like a decade or something. that was not a big issue, while the film and its story telling kept the rhythm always on the high. yep, there's no dull moments, whenever it began to sink under the emotion, repelled back with the same force which is why i hooked all the way. by the way i thought those innocent family sentiments were strongly appealing in a cute manner.

now we talk about the roles. mark ruffalo definitely deserves an oscars nomination. but i can't declare the award for him as i have to find out how the other actors performed in their films. this is his best film in a lead i have seen, probably his career best. to me it is this year's version of the last year's jk simmons performance for the movie 'whiplash'.

> ""our dad is totally polar bear.""

the other side, zoe saldana was as usual in a charming and polite character. as i know she never disappoints her fans. ruffalo and saldana are one of the best on screen pair, looked so real, like a real couple. the two little girls were also awesome in their debuting film. the entire movie's focus was these four members, very occasionally outside characters come into play with hardly any lines to deliver. i wondered what is the meaning of the title and if your focus is on, you won't miss the explanation, which was so cute.

an amazing fusion between the incredible narration and the background score. the tracks (some of them are not ost) as well very good that played till the credits rolled out. i liked 'the pirate song' that was written by the director and 'oogum boogum' was funny. many of them i heard for the first time and thinking to grab them for my movie song collection. overall, it will surely transform your mood by the end of the movie, i mean in a good way.

inspiring, yes the film inspires to have our own little family with kids. especially a perspective of a father and his great responsibility was portrayed tremendously. and also the girls who saved their father from being lost. they stayed for each other and stayed that way as how a parent and his children should be as an example, but in a little harsh human nature.

it is a rare gem, undoubtedly completely enjoyable. this was one of those that came silently into the productions. the earlier posters were unimpressive and made me stay away, but later, now it turned out one of my favourite flick from the 2015. obviously movie fanatics loved this heartwarming family drama and i highly recommend it. as usual like i always say, whether you like it or not, but don't miss it.

no good deed is actually not a bad film as such, it sticks rigidly to a formula and has all the requisite requirements - however ridiculous - for a home invasion thriller, and does it competently. the problem is that it has absolutely nothing new to appeal to anyone who has been watching movies through the 80s and 90s.

the 1990s was particularly a thriving hot-bed for such thriller fare, where some unhinged nut-case - male or female - would impose themselves upon some amiable good person's life, and then unleash mentally distorted hell upon them. sam miller's film is just a lazy retread of what has gone long before. only he and his backers think that shifting the focus to black characters somehow makes it more vibrant. it doesn't.

idris alba is a fine actor (in great physical shape as usual), and taraji p. henson is a more than effective actress, but the turgid screenplay on offer here does them no favours, where even an intended ""big reveal"" is hamstrung by the familiarity of it all. if one is fortunate to be of a youthful enough age and lucky enough to be viewing this thriller format for the first time? then this works, it absolutely does. the more mature film lovers, however, will be jaded to the point of sleep status. and no, that's not meant to be patronising. 4/10",low

what makes the film work is something that early lucas and joss whedon understand:  great sci-fi movies are really westerns at heart.  there is a relationship with nature, a broken, compromised hero, a deep necessity for teamwork, and the story happens out there in the wild.  <em>guardians of the galaxy</em> has all of this.

<em>'guardians of the galaxy'</em> is so enjoyable. it's 121 minutes of pure entertainment. it does, at least to me, have a different feel to it when compared to the nine preceding mcu films. that's not a negative for either this or those earlier productions, it just felt different to me.

i particularly enjoyed the cast, which features - as is customary at this point - a load of well known names. chris pratt is, probably, the perfect choice for peter, he carries the role extremely well - his humour sticks out, but he also performs the more serious stuff nicely.

zoe saldana, dave bautista, bradley cooper and michael rooker are all thoroughly enjoyable too. vin diesel (kinda?) appears to portray groot, which pleases me as someone who is a big fan of <em>'fast & furious'</em>. there are a few others in there, including djimon hounsou and benicio del toro. terrific cast!

3447,"**an american oddity made by finns and set in finland is still an american oddity.**

hollywood has already used us to films where the sacrosanct figure of the president of the usa is the target of the most barbaric attacks, bloodthirsty enemies and a thousand and one terrorist attacks. frequently, the president is sufficiently capable of extricating himself, with the indispensable help of his military and secret agents. sometimes, however, he becomes something of a damsel in distress. this type of film is very pleasant, especially for the american public, as it appeals to the most basic patriotism and often places the usa as a kind of pivot of the west, a great defender of democracies and champion of freedoms, ignoring all sorts of atrocities what the us has done against other countries to defend economic and political interests that have little to do with democracy or freedom.

what this film does is essentially take one of these films and place it in lapland, a region in finland that ordinary people only know because it's the land where santa claus lives. and it could have been santa claus to come to the rescue of the troubled president... but this time, the life of the champion of freedom is in the hands of a finnish child, armed with a bow and a quiver of arrows. a small hunter who knows the forests, the sounds of hunting, the techniques to survive, but who will have to face a group of armed men.

as far as i know, it was the first finnish film i saw, even though it is a co-production in which the usa bet a lot and which is almost entirely spoken in english. directed by jalmari helander, a director who managed to go international and bring a bit of his country to the path of international cinema (we lack men like that in portuguese cinema), it was a fun film that would have been better if it had more scenes in finnish. i don't know if the majority of people in this country are fluent in english, like that boy, but such fluency in a foreign language – even if it is the most international language today – seems to me not very credible in such a young boy. and it would be good if this were the only unbelievable situation here, but unfortunately the film is full of moments where plausibility goes out the door.

i liked the work of samuel l. jackson. he is an extremely competent actor for all sorts of action characters and has an extraordinary charisma that he puts to good use in the film. despite not being, exactly, the protagonist, he assumes a certain protagonism in the story, not allowing himself to be captured without putting up a fight and without resistance, and establishing an excellent collaboration with the young actor onni tommila. the two actors are, to put it mildly, the only ones that deserve a special note. we can still add ray stevenson, but i felt several times that the actor seemed to be struggling with the material he was given, and jim broadbent doesn't have much to do here.

the best thing about this movie is that it's fun to watch, especially for anyone who likes american-style over-the-top action movies. it's full of action scenes, exaggerated and heroic moments, and that makes it able to entertain us. of course, that doesn't mean it's a good movie. it's not. it lacks intelligence, it lacks logic, it lacks scenes in which we are able to see the real finland and not the french alps, it lacks visual and special effects that are really credible and worthy of the name. finally, it lacks a soundtrack that is less presumptuous and strident, and more harmonic. sibelius probably revolved in his grave when he listened to this film's soundtrack.",low

i normally enjoy mark wahlberg movies.
i love bumblebee.  

do any of these hold water?

i know one thing that doesn’t hold a lot of water – the story. does it really matter at this point in the franchise? there are good guy transformers called autobots and bad guy transformers called decepticons and standing between them are stupid humans that betray their species for profit – normally it’s the u.s. government. but wait – there is one hero that will change all of this and talk optimus prime (autobot boss daddy) into fighting one last battle (for the fourth or fifth time – i’ve lost count at this point) while some hot-looking woman runs around explosions in short-shorts.

you now know all you need to know about the entire _transformer_ franchise.

for this incarnation we trade out shia lebeouf for mark wahlberg and courtney fox for nicola pelz. and now for the twist…wait for it… mark wahlberg plays nicola pelz’s father.  that’s right – the father. yeah, it totally doesn’t work. at all.

there’s a point in the movie about 90 minutes in where it looks like all the loose ends are going to get tied up and i thought:  you know, that wasn’t so bad. good action flick, a bit hoaky at points but watchable.

and then the movie keeps going. and going. for another 90 minutes. and you basically watch the movie again except instead of it being in texas and chicago, it’s in china and hong kong.

it’s too long, too many explosions, too many american flags and texas flags in the background. this movie desperately needs an editor or it needs to be euthanized. probably the latter.

i remembered this being decent the first time i watched it, but that was a vidcon, so maybe it was the hype.

this movie is an example of why people don't like found footage, just thrown together as if some stupid kid did it, and then there is active narration and editing from the camera person.  that in itself isn't necessarily a bad thing to have happen, but this one is.  found footage should be found, this is more like first person account...or a fake-umentary.

echo itself (it is not a ""he"") is cute enough but spends a lot of time hiding and there is a communication barrier, but only one way.  if it can connect to the smartphone, then it should be able to use the device as a speaker to express the language it understands from the kids.

alot of the movie is just young boys being defiant and ""girls have cooties, but i like it"".  it fails as a ""coming of age"", it fails as a ""romance"", and it barely succeeds as sci-fi or ""evil secret organization"".

when the fbi guy (cillian murphy) gives a clueless monologue for the first time, i wondered whether that was a potshot. the second time, it became clear the writer has no clue what he's writing about. no, the blender meme wasn't about luddism. 
plots involving ais have been around for decades, and they always require a good amount of suspension of disbelief. but they should never be stupid. (nor should the ais.) here, both are.

there is no depth to the story, no suspense, no unexpected developments either. these topics - ai, nanites, dr. frankenstein improving the world - has been written about competently, oftentimes. a good copy would've done. when this script tries to be deep, philosophical even, it fails.

but that's not the worst of it. 

the only actor to get to express some (some!) emotional range and depth is rebecca hall in her role as eveyln caster. the other actors, good as they are, have very little to work with - all the characters are flat and schematic. the partner: loving. the concerned friend: despairing. the father figure: caring. the terrorists: self-righteous. the fbi: sober. the townspeople: stupid hicks. and so on.

the obvious questions don't get asked, the less obvious - hey, the ai and a number of characters are supposed to be highly intelligent! - aren't asked either. and so the movie plods along to its expected end.

david fincher is a true master class when it comes to directing, because gone girl is one of the best films of this year.

ben affleck was perfect for this role, because ben affleck through out he's career had a lot of hate from the media and the critics that mostly slammed him in every role that he was in. and that's why he was outstanding in this movie.

rosamund pike acting in this film was pure brilliant and spectacular. she was so good in this role she might get a oscar nomination for this. tyler perry in this movie was actually pretty damn good, and am so surprise saying that because mr. perry was in such awful films like: madea trilogy, alex cross and the list goes on. but in this movie he did good.

what this movie does so brilliantly well is how we view media today, because most of the stories you hear on the news might not be true and how the media can spread lies about people and ruining their lives. everybody always believes what the media says even if it's true or not, because we don't know what that person on the news is going through, and this movie got that message out they so perfectly.

3490,"if you enjoy reading my spoiler-free reviews, please follow my blog @
https://www.msbreviews.com

this is it. the last david fincher's film i'll be able to review before mank, his next masterpiece… i hope. i've been through se7en, fight club, zodiac, the social network, and now it's time for fincher's latest installment, gone girl. clearly, fincher loves to work with people he knows. jeff cronenweth has been his director of photography in half of his movies, same for kirk baxter as part of the editing team, and trent reznor and atticus ross in the musical score. even his production designer, donald graham burt, has been around since zodiac. however, fincher always works with a different writer, and this time, he partners up with a debutant screenwriter, gillian flynn, author of the original novel that originates this adaptation.

usually, when it comes to writers, i take this change of media with a grain of salt since writing a book isn't exactly the same as writing a screenplay (it's completely different, i was being generous). with that said, flynn absolutely destroys my self-doubts, delivering one of the best scripts of 2014. from the exceptionally captivating, perplexing disappearance of amy to the underlying theme about how press and media treat this type of news, flynn's screenplay is impressively able to develop each and every narrative in the most perfect way possible. with a remarkable use of time/date stamps, the viewer follows in a detailed manner the events that build up to the tragic day through different perspectives, mainly amy's and nick's.

this story's greatest accomplishment is how it makes the press influence what the viewer thinks about the characters, just like in real life. nowadays, people don't even click to read the full article and understand its context. a single headline, as far from the truth as it might be, is enough to start a worldwide online debate. the same goes for television networks, and their news shows: if it's on the national news program, then it must be true, people think. i may be wrong when i wrote the whole ""change of media"" matter before, but of this, i'm sure: take every news article you read with a grain of salt because most of the time, the full, true story isn't entirely revealed.

this takes me to ben affleck (justice league, the way back) and what i consider one of the best casting choices of the respective decade. in case you don't know, affleck has been pursued throughout his whole life by journalists who try their hardest to expose his personal life, no matter how disrespectful it may turn out to be. nick goes through the exact same obstacle. there's non-stop news about amy, and it only becomes a matter of time until nick starts being accused of being a terrible husband, and ultimately the obvious killer, even though the press can't find a single proof. affleck doesn't even need to incorporate a new character since he has the necessary life experience to offer an utterly brilliant performance. definitely, one of my favorite actors working today.

since i'm in the realm of performances, i might as well continue with rosamund pike (radioactive). her interpretation of amy is almost the opposite of affleck's, in the sense that the latter gives a seemingly simple yet powerful display, while pike has a much more complex, layered role. she can be menacing and scary but also loving and kind. the puzzle surrounding her disappearance is mostly based on a perspective enigma, as the viewer is told the same story through different lenses throughout the first half of the film. honestly, this is probably a career-best performance for pike, who portrays a character of extremes, allowing her to demonstrate her jaw-dropping emotional range.

carrie coon (margo dunne) is another actress i've grown to deeply enjoy watching, and she's terrific as nick's sister. her chemistry with affleck is spot-on, and i sincerely hope that one day she becomes one of the most coveted actresses in hollywood. tyler perry (tanner bolt) is also pretty great as nick's lawyer, but kim dickens is even greater as detective rhonda boney, who partially plays the same role as the viewer by trusting that what she sees and hears is undoubtedly the ultimate truth. flynn's screenplay is packed with twists and turns, some of them more surprising than others, but the third act saves an unexpected, shocking turn of events, leading to a powerful ending that will leave most audiences speechless, myself included.

two minor issues. one of them, you probably have already figured it out since i left neil patrick harris (desi collings) out of the cast compliments above. harris is fine as the character he portrays, but i can't help but feel that he wasn't the right actor for the role. this is a classic fincher movie: dark, somber, depressing, tragic, and with its own share of violence and blood. in fact, it possesses one of the most disgusting, disturbing uses of blood in a single scene i've ever seen. harris is an excellent actor, but he stands out from the rest of the cast, and not in a positive way. again, fine performance, just not the right role for him. the other problem is admittedly an irrelevant nitpick regarding a few details story-wise that stretch the believability of everything just a bit.

nevertheless, this is still a phenomenal film, and it's another evidence of david fincher's masterful visual filmmaking. once again, fincher works with his known crew members to create a sumptuous look and feel. with seamless editing, a memorable score, and fantastic camera work, gone girl is technically magnificent, but it's gillian flynn's debut screenplay that steals the spotlight. boasting jaw-dropping twists, including an utterly shocking third act and respective ending, flynn's narrative is incredibly engaging due to its remarkable structure and puzzling mystery, never losing an inch of excitement or interest. ben affleck is one of the best casting choices of the decade by interpreting a man whose life is deeply affected by the press and media, which should never be fully trusted (a clear and powerful message to the audience), while rosamund pike delivers her career-best performance with an emotionally devastating display. despite the misstep of casting neil patrick harris in such a dark movie and a couple of nitpicks regarding the investigation, everything and everyone else turn this into one of the best films of the 2010s.

i basically gave this a shot because sarah snook looked cute and it was a horror movie i hadn't heard about.  i had really expected it to get a lot better from there.  sadly it doesn't.

the opening sequence is an odd choice, but it's just a mechanic to get her in a wheelchair, which i really wanted to love, but it is used a cheap way to debilitate her and add to a fear of helplessness when it sort of does the opposite.  as someone who has had to use a wheelchair before, it separates the character from most of the audience because they don't have that frame of reference: it's alienating usually.  the movie has to be really good and draw the audience to relate to the character before they can overlook things that seem foreign to them.

there are some really good sequences with the ghost, and it actually reminded me of ""evil dead"" quite a bit, but it did sort of devolve into what looks like two girls mud wrestling, so i'm hoping that wasn't a factor.

the story is all jumbled and clunky in how it's told so it ruins all the parts that would make it interesting, but even with a good mystery / twist, i think the movie would have been average at best, and instead it's a waste of time.  there are so many better movies out there to watch.",low

3500,"the lord of the rings are still occupying the three top places of my top ten movies list. needless to say i am a fan of tolkien and his middle earth fantasy story. i never felt that the hobbit series could match the original trilogy but then much of the story in the hobbit is not really tolkien’s but produced by hollywood scriptwriters to embellish the story enough to fill three movies. it is not a bad attempt by any means (for being a hollywood one) but it does not really reach the heights of the lord of the rings.

still, i quite liked these movies. they are good adventure, fantasy, special effects movies. thus it saddened me when i went to imdb and the first things i saw was a bunch of people shouting crap and giving it one star reviews. that is just so much rubbish. this is the third movie and it is not vastly different from the others. if you disliked the first ones so much why go and see this one? also, the harping about not following the book. at this point that is a nonsense argument. it was fairly obvious that it was not going to follow the book in detail when it was announced that there were going to be three movies and if you did not get it then then you should have gotten it from the other two movies. one star ratings looks more like trolling to me.

anyway, back to the movie itself. i definitely liked this movie better than the second one. it was on par with the first one for me. there was less silly stuff, less stuff that just felt like fillers and the special effects were generally good.

the story and the implementation is, as i wrote, less filled with fillers as the last movie. at least from my point of view. still though, the story is not at all up to the standard of the original tolkien works. it shows that it is a hollywood product that favors effects and quantity before depth and quality. the battle at the end was epic but at the same time somewhat nonsensical in how people ran back and forth clobbering people and beasts right left and center. i did quite like the ramming troll though.

i have to say that i did not like that weasel alfrid. sure he was meant to be disliked but he got tiresome rather quickly. he could have been left out after being pushed into the water as far as i am concerned. after that i just got annoyed every time he appeared and i got especially annoyed by the fact that everyone, even gandalf, seemed to trust him to actually do what he was told. i was hoping all the way to the finishing scenes that he would meet a gruesome end.

on the whole i definitely liked this movie. it had a “tolkienesque” athmosphere, decent acting, decent story and loads and loads of special effects. even though it does not reach the heights of the lord of the rings it is definitely great entertainment for the fantasy, not to mention special effects, lovers.",high
3505,"on valentines day in 2014, universal released the second adaptation of endless love, scott spencer's 1979 national book award nominated novel. the 1981 film adaptation received 6 golden raspberry nominations, so it is fair to say that spencer's novel didn't lend itself well to screen the first time around.

the 2014 tells the story of when 17-year-old jade (gabriella wilde) graduates high school with high hopes for an impressive scholarship, she looks back with some regret at having neglected her social life. classmate david (alex pettyfer) has had a crush on jade throughout high school, but never acted on it. a chance meeting between the two sets in motion a deep summer love, much to the disapproval of jade's father (bruce greenwood), who determines david to be a bad influence on his daughter.

time is a valuable asset in filmmaking, especially when setting the scene for a movie. back stories must be set out, and then fleshed out, so that it's clear what drives the characters to make the choices they do. _endless love_ doesn't feel the need to worry the audience with any of that, starting on graduation day with two protagonists who it is admitted have never spoken to each other, and having them fall straight in love.

jade, who has precious few friends, implying her classmates know very little about her personality, is idolised by david, presumably for being a blonde bombshell. when given the smallest amount of attention from david, jade then is willing to drop everything that her father has coerced her into working for.

when daddy shows his disapproval, because he projects expectations of jade's dead brother onto her, jade becomes little more than a pawn between her father and david. while jade's mother appears to be softer towards the relationship, her viewpoint is completely undermined when we learn that her husband is cheating on her (a plot point that seemingly is to further the animosity between david and jade's father, but becomes completely forgotten about later on).

the acting is passable, but when working with a cardboard screenplay there is very little point.

endless love is the worst type of film. promoting itself as a young woman's choice to leave the clutches of her evil father is both disingenuous, dangerous and damaging to the young women it is aimed at. there is no plot, no backstory, no personality, no point. it is misogynistic, shallow and degrading.

the babadook is written and directed by jennifer kent. it stars essie davis, noah wiseman, daniel henshall and hayley mcelhinney. music is by jed kurzel and cinematography by radek ladczuk.

amelia is a single mother still haunted by the violent death of her husband, she is trying to deal with her young son samuel's fear of a monster in the house. initially tolerating it as a flight of fancy, the arrival of a book in the youngster's bedroom called mr. babadook, signals the start of a sinister presence that she herself can begin to fear as well.

australia has been producing some great horror films in the last couple of decades, the babadook is one of the best of the bunch. jennifer kent made it as a 10 minute short back in 2005 called monster, itself a super piece of horror film making, now in full feature length form (kent’s first), the vision and intelligence explodes off the screen in every frame.

the premise at the core is not exactly fresh, but kent manages to make the babadook its own entity, skilfully steering away from formula jolts and terrors. which in this day and age of horror retreads, sequel frenzies and blood for blood’s sake, is most refreshing. this is a big character piece, a two hander of incredible emotional power, a mother and son dealing with their own demons before the eponymous babadook enters the fray. we care about this pair of troubled souls, so much so that as we start to feel the dread, get the tingles down the spine, our hearts are also aching for them. the two performances of the actors quite simply magnificent.

mr. babadook is a pop-up picture book that suddenly arrives into their lives. the creature  is a sort of cross between a german expressionistic nightmare and jack the ripper. the book itself is creepy enough in its own right, more so as it starts to take on a more terrifying tone – and amelia proves unsuccessful at getting rid of the thing – the picture starts playing its ace psychological cards. the monster is kept mostly to the edges of the frames, or just popping up for a quick glance in unexpected places, this is a great move and suits the narrative perfectly.

the tech credits are top notch. a key aspect to getting the most out of the babadook is to make sure the sound is loud, for the sound mix is tremendous and can bring pounds of gooseflesh rising up on your arms. ladczuk’s photography is at one with the themes pulsing away in the story, the colours paled and cheerless, enhancing the fractured psyches of mother and son, but mr. babadook is a jet black presence in this landscape. all told the art design from the book to the house and the creature is excellent.

umbrella’s australian all region blu-ray release has a super transfer and does justice to the sound mix. there’s over an hour of interviews, which are a mixed bag of informative chat and back slapping, a 12 minute behind the scenes making of and some trailers. the bonus is the 10 minute short, monster, the babadook in its infancy but no less scary for it.

the babadook is a superlative horror film for adults, like when polanski met kubrick and they decided to pay homage to fritz lang and george melies. yes it’s that good. 10/10",high

3522,"three crazy women for five weeks is a lot more than i bargained for. 

the homesman is directed by tommy lee jones, who also co-adapts the screenplay from glendon swarthout's novel with kieran fitzgerald and wesley a. oliver. it stars jones, hilary swank, grace gummer, miranda otto and sonja richter. music is by marco beltrami and cinematography by rodrigo prieto. 

three women who have been driven mad by pioneer life are to be transported east across the country to iowa. when the men of the town refuse to stand up and be counted, single, pious and independent-minded mary bee cuddy (swank), enrols for the task. recruiting scallywag drifter george briggs (jones) to aid the journey, it becomes an arduous journey that will make or break both of them. 

the homesman is a tricky western, revisionist of heart and blood, and grim in nature, it's got a narrative that has (and will continue to do so) invited criticism from different quarters. it has been called misogynistic on one side of the fence, and feminist on the other! while there is a humongous narrative jump that has been lauded as great from some, and a film killer by others. the truth is that only each viewer can judge from their own personal perspectives. personally i think that jones has blended both the former angles to perfection, whilst the latter issue is to me an outstanding and brave piece of film. 

the life of the pioneer women is shatteringly brought into sharp focus, right from the off there's brutality blended with utter sadness as jones the director cuts no corners in setting up the film. big question then hits us in the face - just how did the old west deal with those suffering mental disturbance? in this instance it's to pack them off to the east where they will be tended by a minister and his wife (the latter of which played by meryl streep in little more than a cameo). the three women are vividly portrayed by otto, gummer and richter, but this aspect of the film is only a side-bar to the crux of the story. 

this is of course about mary cuddy and george briggs, a man and woman at total different ends of the spectrum. she's sad at being alone without a man, he's more than happy to be without a woman. everything suggests that this is going to be ""one of those films"" where opposites find a soul mate, but jones and his backers may not be reverting to type? i mean for a start how interesting to find this journey going from west to east, that says much about the film right there, a pioneer journey in reverse. while the prominent ladies here may be mad, abused or needy, you will be searching far and wide for a decent man in this here tale.

the landscapes are deftly photographed by prieto, eye opening but never to the detriment of the narrative thrust of pioneer hardship. betrami lays ethereal piano and string arrangements all over the piece, while joining streep in short bursts of cameo characterisations are james spader, john lithgow, william fitchner, hailee steinfeld and tim blake nelson, that's quite an armoury of performers. even if you can't help but want more from them all. 

but it's swank and jones, a superb pairing, who give the grade ""a"" performances. jones lifts his old cantankerous ruffian character to greater heights, making briggs the anti-hero to the anti-hero. while swank hasn't been this great for a long time, making mary cuddy strong and inspiring, yet also evidently suffering inner turmoil. swank's turn epitomises the homesman, shrewd and insightful, humane and heartfelt. top stuff all round, it's great to see modern directors confident enough to make biting moody westerns. 9/10",high

normally, i love movies with a twist, but a twist is nothing if the cast, script and anything really... is bad. in this case, nothing works. nicolas cage (whom i know can act) is two dimensional and anything he does seems false and... without passion. while shooting this movie, he must have figured out that it was a mistake and simply... given up. it shows. it just goes to say, a good actor (and i am not saying that nicolas cage is a good actor, but he can act, just watch adaptation) can't keep a movie going on his own, except if your name is tom hardy and the movie is locke, or robert redford and the movie is called all is lost. unfortunately, this movie is called tokarev, the name of a gun, and that... just... says it all. really.

i gave this movie two stars, and i'd like to tell you why. peter stomare has a small role, and he is always good, and... the ending that goes on beyond the credits... is actually a nice little touch. but everything else. not worth the bother.

nicolas cage stars as a reformed mobster who is forced to go back to his violent ways when his daughter is kidnapped by baddies.

it is what it is really, a nic cage starrer that does exactly what the plot synopsis suggests. does it bring anything new to the revenge formula of genre film making? absolutely not. but on reflection there are very few that have improved upon originals from as far back as fritz lang's fury in 1936. sure there is more blood now, more gruesome deaths to put bums on theatre seats, but the majority of them remain soulless, existing only for the point of existing. the market is there for those who either enjoy such genre splatters, or for those who like me just merely wanted a brainless pic to pass the time away with - which of course means leaving said brain at the door.

it's all very preposterous, even insulting at times, but this is actually no worse than some of the more praised revenge thrillers of recent times - but that just makes the point that ultimately the bar hasn't been set high for a considerable time now. so wake up film makers! give us something new! 5/10",low

this time i have to side with the people trashing this movie, even the so called “critics” at rotten tomatoes. this is a bad movie. it could have been a half decent movie. the basic idea is perhaps not super original but it could have been made to work. however, it is simply loaded with religious bullshit. once you filter out said bullshit, which is bloody difficult since you are more or less force fed it during most of the movie, there is really nothing left.

the behavior of people are bizarre to say the least. the dialogue is mostly nonsensical. the movies attempt at putting different and original characters, including an obnoxious dwarf, on the plane is feeble. the action and special effects are generally lousy and the attempts to put some thrill and drama into the landing of the plane is laughable. come on, you see a plane coming, it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that it has no pilot and is flying in a straight line. you are over the atlantic, a minor course change would have done the job and there was plenty of time. but nooo, the idiot script writer had cage fly in a straight line like a chicken race until it was too late. and do not get me started on the stupidity of having someone driving down a stretch of highway in a pickup truck knocking over plastic cones to “clear it for landing”.

the problem here is that the movie plays like a remake of the last king of scotland – and is just about as faithful to reality. nick has gone surfing in colombia, where he meets maría (claudia traissac), and it's love at first sight. little does nick know that maría is escobar’s ‘almost-like-a-daughter-to-me’ niece. yada yada yada the young, wide-eyed foreigner is seduced by the superficially affable and charismatic sociopath, only to discover sooner rather than later that there is no such thing as a free lunch.

now, del toro can conjure affability, charisma, and sociopathy at the drop of hat, and he doesn't need to be in every scene to steal the movie; conversely, he couldn't save the film even if he did appear in every scene, because the story isn't about him, so escobar doesn't so much inhabit the movie as he hovers over it, like a bird of prey.

3553,"this film tells the story of an over-the-hill actor called riggan thomson (brilliantly portrayed by michael keaton) who was once the star of a superhero blockbuster franchise known as 'birdman'. we are shown his journey into making a broadway production starting with the initial rehearsals and read-throughs. what follows is a brilliant exploration of celebrity culture in an intriguing and satirical way.

'birdman' could essentially be looked at as one continuous long shot. the camera constantly weaves around the actors and action and so the audience are completely immersed into the perspectives of the various characters (mostly riggan's). the opening shot plays like a scene in paul thomas anderson's 'boogie nights' as it delightfully establishes the narrative in a fluid and polished style whilst introducing the cast and their entertaining interchanges during a rehearsal with hilarious consequences. 

the editing throughout the picture is almost flawless when moving from scene to scene and has a dizzying effect much like gasper noé's 'irreversible'. 'birdman' also boasts some marvellous special effects throughout such as when riggan (keaton) is alone and being taunted by his egotistical alter-ego. the film shows up typical blockbuster action movies by asking the audience what they want and giving it to them in a manner which embraces the excitement and epic-ness of the genre whilst also poking fun of the conventions.

the music that accompanies the film is very scarce in a lot of places adding emphasis to the dialogue and situations arising but, in some cases, an erratic and improvisational drum riff can be heard (occasionally accompanied with the drummer on the set) which completely adds to the eccentricity and spontaneity of the movie.

the screenplay is very intricately written and contains many profound philosophical speeches about art, celebrity and criticism. there are monologues and debates by characters in which they discuss the core beliefs of the film such as riggan's speech during his performance of his raymond carver play ""what we talk about when we talk about love"".

the whole narrative of the film is very intriguing and interesting. there is a perfect blend of comedy and poignancy. there are a lot of twists and ambiguity throughout the film which could be analysed and interpreted for a long time.

michael keaton is fantastic as the protagonist and gives a performance that would have given his career a huge revival (his squeal is my highlight of the film). the parallels with the character's career and that of keaton's could not have been a mistake and gives the performance that much more edge. edward norton plays the method actor from hell (mike shiner). he is annoying, snobbish and smug and played brilliantly by norton who excels in the vileness and pomposity of the character.

the film is very much about actors. the self obsessive nature of acting is definitely highlighted by the two central performances but there is also a cast that really help to deliver the film's meaning such as emma stone, zach galifianakis, andrea riseborough and naomi watts.

overall, 'birdman' is a fantastic film. it is filled with pathos and profound imagery whilst keeping the viewer thoroughly entertained throughout.

3554,"""i'm nothing. i'm not even here.""

the story to birdman is about an wash up actor (michael keaton) - famous for portraying an iconic superhero - as he struggles to mount a broadway play. in the days leading up to opening night, he battles his ego and attempts to recover his family, his career, and himself.

okay in my review of whiplash i bought this movie up mid way through the review just to give a heads up of when i'm going to watch it, because birdman was my most anticipated film of 2014. but just like every time i really wanted to see a film so baldy i have to wait for a while until i finally get a chance to watch it, story of my life really. but anywhere, i was really looking forward to this movie ever since september, and now finally seeing the film i can safely say that birdman is one of the best movie of 2014.

i always know that micheal keaton was the kind of movie star that will pick any random movie role just because... well he what's to be important and still show to everyone that he still got it, i guess. early last year he was in two movies that were pretty blah, and that was the robocop (remake) and need for speed, and those films just made keaton look like he was just cashing it in just for the sake of it. until i watched this movie and seeing micheal keaton's performance and thinking to myself ""wait is keaton giving probably his best performance i've ever seen in my life? i think he is"", because keaton in this movie pretty much pulls of the best performance i've seen him in his all career. his character in this movie is like a washed up actor who had everything like: the love from the critics and he's fans. yeah he still dose have that keaton thing that he always dose in his previous movies, but the scenes where he plays his character (which is himself if you really look at his character in this movie) but anywhere he still gives a strong and believable performance that at times give me flashbacks of the good old days when he still had roots and felt like he isn't just cashing it in. i hear a lot of oscar buzz about his performance in this movie, and i wouldn't be surprise if he wins because he totally deserves it. excellent work keaton.

edward norton is also in this movie and played a familiar character to himself has the hard to work with actor that at times doesn't follow the lines that he was given or even the direction he was told. we already know that norton is a fantastic actor in his previous work, but in this movie his performance could be descried has stellar and insanely good.

emma stone is this movie and of course like most of the actors i named off so far who were outstanding in this movie and well you can already guess what i'm going to say next. emma stone acting in this movie was just terrific and marvellous to watch. it's good to see a real break out performance from her more than the lay back ones in her other movies. nice one emma. the other cast in the movie like naomi watts, zach galifianakis both did good as well.

the whole movie is shot to look like it's all in one shot and my mind was just blown away by that fact. there were scenes in way i said to myself ""oh my god is it one shot?"", well i can already imagine the stress, hard work and how many takes they had to do to get it, and boy did it pay off nicely, because i couldn't take my eyes off the screen. i dared myself to look away from the beautiful cinematography and the impressive editing used in the film.

the movie has a brilliant message about film critics today that doesn't feel like it's in your face message that you normally get in movies. there's a scene in this movie and by the way it's not a spoiler, but i really need to get this out the way first. micheal keaton character starts having a rant over this theater critic who is going to give a bad review to he's play when she hasn't even seen it or any of the premieres. he talks about how she only users big words that nobody will say in person and shes to lazy to come up what she really thinks about it so she users big words just to fill in the sentence. this movie probably has the best rant in movie history and keaton in that scene shows how good of a actor that he is.

for problems in the movie: i really don't have any to be honest.

i loved this movie and yes i'm coming out be saying that. this isn't just the best movie of the year and such, no this is just flawless film making right here. birdman and whiplash are the two films i will highly recommend to people, because those two films are my favorite films of 2014.",high

3560,"when i sat down to watch this film, i didn't know what to expect. i am not usually a fan of films about musicians but this was a brilliant and tense masterpiece. the story is of a very ambitious boy named andrew (played by miles teller) who is a music student in new york. he aspires to be noticed by a prestigious music teacher named fletcher (played by j.k. simmons). as his wish starts becoming a reality, he realises the brutality of this teacher who continually pushes him with questionable methods. damien chazelle's direction is almost of a tense boxing or war action drama in that it constantly uses the music of the drumming to build the tension whilst using violent and sharp editing whilst the jazz band play.

chazelle's screenplay is very well written. it is filled with humour, tension and heartbreak. the way in which fletcher switches during andrew's first lesson is expertly done. fletcher relentlessly insults andrew in a very shocking way which really creates a huge sense of sympathy for andrew's character as he struggles to respond. the insulting dialogue is very similar to stanley kubrick's 'full metal jacket' in that it is both humourous and disturbingly distressing.

the performances in this film are remarkable. miles teller is a relative newcomer but takes to this character with so much depth and understanding. the drumming scenes look like incredible and torturous workouts and teller really shows the pain and agony his character is going through to reach his dream. the chemistry between the two central characters is flawless. j.k. simmons is perfect as the abusive music teacher. simmons manages to combine fletcher's distinguished persona with his terrifying unpredictability. simmons reminds me of his character in valve's 'portal 2' in which he continuously spouts insults at the player in a darkly hilarious way.

overall, 'whiplash' is a fascinating study of passion, ambition and love. the film asks questions about the morality of getting one's dreams and the acceptable methods of acquiring them. full of amazing performances all around, and created with such intensity and spirit, my final rating for this film is 4.5 stars.

whiplash follows are main character andrew neyman who is a young jazz drummer, single-minded in his pursuit to rise to the top of his elite east coast music conservatory. plagued by the failed writing career of his father, andrew hungers day and night to become one of the greats. terence fletcher, an instructor equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods, leads the top jazz ensemble in the school. fletcher discovers andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band, forever changing the young man's life.

ok let me just start off with this. you had no idea how much i was really looking forward to whiplash. this was on my movies to check out list, because i heard nothing but positive things from this movie and i heard a lot of people described this film has the ""full metal jacket"" but with no war or guns, but with music and well... drums. i think whiplash and ""birdman"" was the two movies i wanted to see before making my best movies of the year list, because who knows they might make the list. i haven't seen ""birdman"" yet but will do soon, but i finally had the chance to see whiplash and my god this movie was just so spectacularly flawless in many ways. whiplash is the best move of 2014.

j.k. simmons in this movie probably pulls of the best performance in his career. every word that came out of his mouth didn't feel like he was reading from the script then act it out. i felt every angry punch of words that came out of him, because it was so real. i didn't see j.k. simmons just playing a movie character in this movie, no he was the freaking fletcher.

now let's talk about terence fletcher: the best way to describe fletcher to those who haven't seen the film yet, well his like sgt. hartman from ""full metal jacket"". when he's on screen your locked on and he's also the kind of person that would be somebody's worse nightmare to have for a boss. this guy doesn't just like music, he breaths music and he wants his band to do perfect. his opinion and his look on music is another thing why i didn't flat out just hated him, i actually understood him. he made a very good point about how people will comment on you act and say ""you did a good job"", and yes i did use the words ""you did a great job"", in my past reviews but now i'm never going to use it ever again after this movie.

miles teller was another stand out performances in this movie, and just like ""foxcatacher"" where channing tatum was so over looked by his performance, well miles teller has proved himself to be more then a teen in a movie that will be forgotten and so would he, but no miles teller played this character so brilliantly he could become the next big thing. now his character in this movie has the love of the true art of music and you can see that he wants to tell people his love for music, but when the harsh life of reality comes crashing into him it's truly heartbreaking to see his struggle and effort just not being good enough. teller played this character so realistic and so brilliantly flawless.

the directing and the writing in this was just....perfect. damien chazelle gave this movie style and passion to tell a story about two strong music buffs battling out and he freaking nailed it.

this movie also had probably the best finale that i've seen in years. my nails were digging into the seat. i didn't dare to look away not for one moment, not for one second. i was simply locked on and when it was over... i'm kidding you i actually clapped towards the end of this movie. now the biggest cliche that i always hear from critics when their talk about a different movies and their use words like ""you will clap at the end"", but you don't, or ""you will feel inspired after the film"", and i you don't. but whiplash actually did make me feel inspirited towards the end and made me clap. it's message of not giving up and the dream that you been chancing for isn't just going to come to you. movies like pride, freedom writers and all that such never ever give me that inspiring feeling inside of me, until i watched this movie.

overall rating: whiplash is a movie that everybody needs to see. this isn't just a popcorn movie where you come and put you legs up and laugh a couple of times, no this movie reaches out to people out there that have the same problems that these character's have, with their passion of what their what to do in life get's over shadowed by something you don't want to do and this movie get's it right. so go and see if you have the chance.",high

i have to mention all these, because to remind ourselves how far we'd come. today to travel to another continent you've to pass so many formalities like visa, passport, security check, background check, check-up for latest fast spreading disease, body scans for smuggling, purpose of visit etc. it is better to turn into a bird and fly away than going through all this. that's why i am not a nationalist and call myself the citizen of planet earth, which put me on debate with guys around on the several occasions.

okay. the movie was inspired by 'lost boys of sudan'. the true story of four young sudanese, after their elders were killed in the attack of their village they team up to escape. henceforth living in the refugee camp in kenya, looking for an opportunity for a better life. it lands, but struggle continues as to adapt the new place and finding the right employment. the journey from nowhere to the land of dream, but they had no dream at all, all they wanted was a normal life anywhere peacefully. on the other end, the rules and regulations begin to haunt them, which they were not used to it.

> ‘‘we found strength in sticking together
>  but our hope of ever leaving was fading.’’

definitely an inspiring story. for the meaning of the title, you have to wait until the last minute. because all the great stories told in the history began or ends with the great sacrifice. that was a touching scene, i just imagined, in reality, how tough it would have been. you probably don't understand what i'm saying, but i'm trying to keep spoiler away. we had seen the similar theme from another angle in gerard butler starer 'machine gun preacher'. yep, about the same war, but set in a different place. the main difference is this movie is not a heroic tale like that where a white man fights for the innocent africans. you know there are about 20.000 boys and girls orphaned and displaced during the civil war that lasted for nearly 25 years. the writer had to pick just one from the thousands of stories. so that's how 'the good lie' came, a story of complete integrity.

from the filmmaker of oscar nominated foreign movie 'monsieur lazhar'. one of my favourites from canada. i loved all his previous films, so the expectation for this was same as always. it partially feels like a docudrama, but it was not. leaping into hollywood did not change his style of film making. he turned into an american movie in which something lacks today, reality and honesty with dynamic story than its characters. reese witherspoon's presence did not affect either, the narration was neutral from the perspective of character preference. in fact, reese witherspoon's existence helped to put some familiar face on the posters. especially for the marketing purpose for the wide release, other than the film festivals. so this movie definitely is to go for it, only if you're not seeking entertainment.

the movie is very dark and gritty and there are really no likeable characters in it whatsoever. well, the clerk that got thrown in as a tank machinegun gunner was perhaps somewhat likable but then him getting assigned as a tank machinegun gunner in the first place was one of those nonsensical bits. in this movie the “heroes” are not really any better than the nazis. the scene where “wardaddy” forces previously mentioned clerk to shoot an unarmed pow is just disgusting. i am sure this is not too far from reality in some cases during the war but i’ll be damned if i am watching a movie to be entertained by it.

having said that i must also say that the movie was very well done in terms of acting and cinematography with one exception. the ridiculous overuse of tracer bullet effects. tracer bullets do not look like you are in a star wars movie and yes i have been using tracer bullets during my military service, obviously unlike the producer and consultants (if they had any) of this movie.

the pacing of the movie was somewhat uneven. some of it was fairly fast paced but then some parts, like the part in the apartment of the two german women was quite slow and somewhat dull.

the “last stand” at the end was just silly and nonsensical. it started pretty much right away when the poor clerk spots the arriving german infantry just using his eyes. then it just takes forever until they actually arrive so our “heroes” have all the time in the world to prepare. there would of course be no way for a lone sherman to hold off an assault like that and the germans would of course not be charging around shooting useless fine caliber weaponry against said sherman. also when they had all this time to prepare why the f… did they leave some of the ammo outside the tank? obviously because some dumb scriptwriter thought it would make for a good scene. and do not get me started on the fact that the germans apparently just stops in their tracks every time the director thinks it is time for some slow scene inside the tank.

the ending? well i do not like bad endings and this one certainly did not give me any feeling of reward for having suffered through over two hours of this movie. needless to say i am a tad disappointed.",low
3576,"this film is about a tank crew in ww2 that is going into the final days of the war and still facing hell.
the characters are very credible, and this passes the ultimate test of ""credible characters in incredible circumstances"". 
the five members each have a different level of humanity, from the novice to war who still has total humanity down to the one tank crew member who is a total brute. yet even he has some humanity left in him, but he hardly shows it.
the other three are the tank commander (brad pitt), who handles brutality of war with objectivity, his second, who handles brutality by trying to be right with god, and the other one uses comedy to handle it.
i've been in the military, and it is quite common for ""clerks"" to be tossed into war like cannon fodder, because that is what ""clerks"" are viewed as being by everyone else, from officers down to the one stripers.
in fact, the clerks are considered to be the most disposable members of the forces. 
we know that today. people didn't always know it in ww2.
the final self sacrifice at the end seems a bit much, but when you take into consideration that it's a spare of the moment decision, and mistakes are made with quick decisions, it's plausible. not probable, but plausible.
also, the final battle scene with five men doing so well against an incredibly larger force; well, that is sold to us by the amount of smoke around the tank, and the fact that if you are on the other side, surrounding the tank, you wonder if you are shooting at your own teammates across from you. 
i think it would have been a better movie if the five soldiers all just abandoned the tank and tried to walk back to safety, but that's just me.
other than that, it was an exceptional film that passes all the tests.",high
3578,"sometimes you gotta sacrifice a single sheep to save the rest.

the salvation is directed by kristian levring and levring co-writes the screenplay with anders thomas jensen. it stars mads mikkelsen, eva green, jeffrey dean morgan, eric cantona, mikael persbrandt, jonathan pryce and douglas henshall. music is by kasper winding and cinematography by jens schlosser.

1871 and ex-patriot danish soldier jon jensen (mikkelsen) is, after 7 years of foundation building, welcoming his wife and son to a new life in america. but after they all board a stagecoach bound for their homestead, events will see that journey not be completed. and thus begins a tale of retribution and redemption. 

there are few smiles in the salvation, in fact viewers will need to grab onto the sparse offerings of such very early in the piece. for it's a film of blood, brooding and misery, of intensity and a paucity of the good side of human nature. levring has managed to successfully blend the traditions of the american western with the feel of the euro spaghetti oaters. there is so much for western fans to enjoy here. it's a classic revenger pumped by a good versus bad heart, yet as pared down and as simple as the story may at first seem, there's interesting asides of worth. 

the issue of euro immigrants trying to make it in the wild west is noteworthy, while there's a delicious juxtaposition between two soldiers from different continents, and different wars. jensen fought the germans in europe, while his nemesis, henry delarue (morgan), has been through the indian wars. a most interesting comparison, one where the characterisations are vividly opposed to each other. add in a good old town in the grip of a tyrant theme, and a bit of carnal desires upon thine brother's spouse, and it's a spicy hot pot.

filmed at dusty south african locations, there's a scenic beauty surrounding the harsh story. westerns don't have to be filmed in america to look authentic, and this is a case in point. the town of black creek has been called fake looking in some quarters, not so. this is a new up-coming town, it's meant to be wooden and sparse. hell! the saloon is also the local store, the mayor is also the undertaker, this is a basic wild west town without frills and fancy.

elsewhere the costuming is splendid, especially morgan who is nicely dapper in black hat and crimson mack, and there's a whole host of face fuzz on show, which is needed to keep up the whole mud and blood, hard west factor. levring has an eye for a nice shot, such as a full moon bearing witness, even a traditional slow-mo piece. all that said, irks do exist, green's character is sketchily drawn, but she's playing a heaving bosom mute (her tongue was cut out by the pesky indians), so scope for development is admittedly limited. while winding's score is a bit too modern sounding for the key shoot-out sequences.

ultimately it's great to see the western is still thriving in this day and age of cgi and blockbuster pandering. from the shattering and moody first quarter to the bloody and excellently staged finale, the salvation keeps the western genre well and truly alive. 9/10",high

3591,"if you like old-fashioned james bond style movies you probably like this one. it is a bit more outrageous and has a few more overly silly moments than the old bond movies but on the whole this is a very fun and enjoyable secret agent movie.

gary is, via a few twists and turns at the beginning of the movie, recruited by a secret agent employed by a super secret private organisation with remarkable resources. their agents looks and behaves like london upper class gentlemen but have remarkable fighting skills. the initial scenes when gary is recruited are just great.

gary is then submitted to a rather gruesome training schedule and at the same time the main plot plays out in parallell. of course the two threads merge towards the classical showdown with the megalomaniacal evil mastermind in the end where, naturally, gary gets to save the world.

the movie has all the “goodies” of a secret agent movie. british gentlemen agents, action, secret agent “stuff” like shops that are not what they look like, hidden entrances into secret bases, rooms that are actually elevators and of course gadgets, lots of gadget to help our heroes thwart the evil mastermind’s nefarious plans. of course said mastermind have a personal henchman a la oddjob to do the more grisly parts of his evil biddings. i quite liked this rather unique henchman, or rather henchwoman, and her odd weapons. more so than the main villain which i found a bit bland at times.

on the whole i enjoyed this movie a lot. however, there are some silly parts which drags it down a bit. i especially disliked the colorful exploding heads towards the end of the movie. that just felt like the producer/director was smoking some funny stuff when making those scenes. there were a few other scenes which i felt was going too much towards silly comedies as well. without those i would probably have added a star.

3605,"_nightcrawler_ shows the dark and sadistic rise of an underground freelance video producer that left me on the edge of my seat in disbelief throughout the entire film.

the film begins following lou bloom, a man down on his luck during economic turmoil trying to find his way in the world. the whole first act really builds his sense of helplessness and drive to help lift himself out of his financial hardship. this drive is built upon throughout the entire story as with each step bloom’s morals and societal lines drift farther and farther from the norms. the entire theme of the story really resonates with common day america, as you are told to work hard and pave a path for yourself no matter the cost to those around you. dan gilroy did an outstanding job with the direction and writing of the entire film. the unsettling nature of dialogue and characters actions/motivations is incredibly eerie as it is indicative of society today. each scene feels real as if it is a retelling of true events. i believed every second of lou bloom as a character, and that is largely due to jake gyllenhall’s best performance to date.

gyllenhall does such an excellent job of putting on this outcast persona. as a loner, he spends most of his time learning on the internet and due to that he does not really understand the nuances of everyday life. this is done tremendously well as every line delivered by gyllenhall is so sharp and awkward, but the source of the words is tremendously powerful. the sense of emotion displayed by the lead is fantastic as well, he swings from being incredibly upset to quickly turning into a calm put together businessman. it demonstrates bloom’s extreme passion for this work as his emotions blind him to not only his speech but slowly morality. every aspect of gyllenhall’s performance was incredibly visceral and every bit deserving of an oscar. i touched a lot on the main lead here, but the supporting cast was all around spectacular. rene russo and riz ahmed did excellent jobs in their parts. they were able to mirror the audience's reactions to the unhinged nature that is lou bloom, this aspect really resonated with me.

overall, _nightcrawler_ was one of the best movies i have seen in a long time. it was able to capture me in the world and had me completely engaged with the story gilroy was attempting to deliver. the film ends with a bang and has left me thinking about it hours after viewing.

3607,"i've also struggled to appreciate several o luc besson's movies but this is is by far the worst one.

3610,"_**time to grow up**_

""lucy"" (2014) is about an average hot babe named lucy, played by scarlett johansson, who increasingly taps into her mind's full capacity and, consequently, acquires superhuman powers (or are they just fully-human powers?). she hooks up with the leading expert on the human mind (morgan freeman) to share her discoveries and also teams-up with a paris police captain (amr waked) to destroy the malevolent schemes of an arrogant asian mob boss (min-sik choi). 

it should be emphasized that this is not comic book superhero movie (don't we have enough of those yet?), it's an ordinary-person-reaching-full-human-potential movie. there were two of these in the mid-90s, ""powder"" (1995) and ""phenomenon"" (1996). they're both good, but the latter played it too safe, particularly at the end, while ""powder"" reached for greatness and got a finger in. francis ford coppola added his take on the genre with 2007's ""youth without youth,"" a dense film with many interesting elements; too bad he forgot to include an entertaining story. 

""lucy"" is the best of these and is, in fact, one of my all-time favorite movies. ""lucy"" includes the mindfood of coppola's film, but doesn't forget to be entertaining. as such, the film mixes interesting, inspiring elements with thrills, action, eye candy and ear candy (a notable score). on top of this, ""lucy"" is stylish and ""hip,"" whatever that means; in other words, it's got pizzazz.

some complain that the film is flawed because it's based on the notion that we only use 10% of our brain power, but this is only a plot device to illustrate that most people are functioning way under their potential and are obsessed with usually worthless things and blowing precious time accordingly. take, for instance, the people who blow hour upon hour of valuable time watching sports. viewing a game here or there is great, but these types have lost all sense of moderation. or how about those who feel they have to numb themselves with alcohol or drugs just to have a good time? they're, in essence, running away from reality. 

what's funny about this criticism that the film's based on humans only using 10% of their brain power is that, in most cases, the number's more like 1-2%. lol, just kidding. (or am i?) 

in regards to lucy's powers illustrated in the film, and the other films noted above, i've had my own run-ins with such phenomena. for instance, about seven years ago i was in bed having an intense dream when my wife burst into the room to wake me up. the smoke alarm outside the door was blaring like crazy, but there was no smoke or fire or heat. the potent energy evoked by my dream obviously set it off because, as soon as i awoke, it suddenly stopped. if there was any doubt, the same thing happened the next week. what can explain this except the untapped power of the mind and focused energy? 

another example comes to mind, albeit different: when i was around 8 years old my family and i were walking the trails of theodore wirth park in minneapolis when we came to the edge of a baseball field. as soon as we entered the outfield somehow i just knew that the current batter was going to hit the ball and it was going to hit me right in the face. i knew this but i didn't know how i knew it. i just knew. next thing you know the batter hits the ball high into the air -- it was like slow-motion -- and it came and hit me right on the cheek! (good thing it was a softball, huh?). how did i know this was going to happen? i don't know, but it's pretty amazing and it shows the power of the mind and spirit to warn us, which some call intuition.

less spectacular is something that i experience every day with my wife: one of us will be thinking something and give voice to it and the other says, ""i was thinking the exact same thing."" what's going on? we're picking up each other's immaterial thoughts, otherwise known as telepathy. what if we developed this further? other paranormal phenomena featured in the story include psychokinesis, extraordinary empathy and what the bible calls ""the word of knowledge."" although they're exaggerated in the film, they're real.

""lucy"" is inspiring in that it's an encouragement to grow up. as lucy evolves she stops at her apartment and runs into her roommate, who's the typical bimbo party girl who spends too much of her free time ""partying"" and pursuing a ""cute guy with nice buns"" (or however she puts it). not that there's anything intrinsically wrong with these things, except that these people obsess over them and they become their purpose for living. whatever happened to ""all things in moderation""? the beginning of the movie shows that lucy was just like her roommate but something happened and... she grew up.

my praise of the movie's philosophical and theological ideas shouldn't be interpreted to mean that i agree with every jot and tittle. it's a sci-fi/thriller blockbuster, after all; it's just that this one has more interesting ideas than most. secondly, who agrees with everyone about everything? is that even healthy?

needless to say, i love ""lucy""! 

the film doesn't wear out its welcome at a mere 1 hour, 29 minutes, and was shot in taiwan, france and a german airport.

3616,"this is very much my kind of movie. straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from his path and no social or emotional nonsense. those who have watched the movie might wonder why i claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire plot is driven by john wick’s very emotional response to his wife’s death and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from her. what i mean with “no emotional nonsense” is that john wick is never second guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an “ordinary” guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn’t go into some silly “oh should i really pull the trigger” trance and drops the gun in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. sure, there are emotions in this movie. rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guys…eventually that is.

the plot of the movie is, as i wrote, quite straightforward and classical. retired hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. hit man gets pissed off and goes on a quest for revenge. people die (a lot of them). hit man and big bad guy have a show down at the end. in terms of story that is about it. however, such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and in a less good and entertaining way. as far as i am concerned the way the story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.

keanu reeves is quite good as the hit man. so are the big bad guy and most of the other actors of any importance. during the course of the movie we get more than a few glimpses into john wick’s former life and it is a quite cool background that have been elaborated. the secret world that john wick was once part of and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned james bond movie.

then of course there is the action. it is an action movie so you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint. there are lots of action and it is good action. sure, the ease by which john wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness and grace that just makes it … so cool. the gun fights are generally mixed up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really well woven together.

one thing that i really like with this movie is that john wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pissed off, killing machine from start to finish. there are really no slow parts or “obligatory” scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. it is “the bad guys will pay” all the way. this of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements that i quite like in a story like this. for instance the parts where the spoiled total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some good, honest to god, fear. fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly pissed off.

unless something is blatantly political to the point that it irritates me for reasons of propaganda...i try to slam both sides in these reviews.

i don't really feel that i have to here because the film is about jesus and coming out the door we already know that people are going to be insanely pro-religion or adopt that anti-religious stance that borders on pathology.

so, instead we're going to go right to the review and state flatly that there are better movies about jesus that you can watch.

the last temptation of christ is, of course, top on that list. this is seconded by jesus christ superstar. and, in both cases, even if you are a fundamentalist christian or have such a phobia against religion that you feel compelled to hate everything on principal...you should be able to agree that those are two stellar films on purely dramatic and cinematic basis.

son of god really isn't...at all. it tries very hard to be as faithful to the jesus story as it can and still be a dramatization...but because of that it falls short on the ""drama"" department.

it comes across feeling sort of stale and i'm not entirely sure how it can recover.

the people involved in son of god did do some things right, ""the bible"" was compelling...but it was delivered in short segments that worked as little stand alone stories and made the entire series really very watchable and enjoyable.

you can't really do that here, and they failed when they adopted the new testament a few years later.

i suppose the best way to review it would be to say that is has a lack of emotional focus. the depiction of jesus is almost void of a real dynamic personality and because of that the only real dramatic value is situational and that doesn't work with the way that the film is laid out.

if you are looking for films about jesus, there are far better options...but those options are significantly less accurate. but, i'm of the view that if you want accuracy, read about it.

3707,"**highly militant, a more neutral film would have been better.**

this is a difficult film to comment on. on the one hand, and speaking exclusively from a technical point of view, it is a really good and well-made film. on the other hand, i have many questions and points of disagreement that prevent me from really approving it. and the reader better be ready to disagree healthily with what i write, because i'm not used to hiding what i think, or amputating my opinions under the guillotine of political correctness.

i know that the film was acclaimed when it came out and that the publicity machine sold it very well. i also know that it is one of the most beloved films in the glbt (and all the letters and symbols they want to add) community. i have already written some reviews of other films, in which i criticized the excessive yielding to political correctness or moral/social lobbies. since cinema is an artistic and leisure experience, i don't like to see it used for advertising or indoctrination of ideas and morals. we are supposed to enjoy watching a film and seeing the talent and artistry of those involved, not feeling that the film is trying to tell us what we should think about a subject or a theme, which is what this film tries to do. for this indoctrination, the script addresses an unknown figure: einar wegener, a danish landscape painter little known internationally because he became known more as a “trans” personality than as a painter.

married to gerda wegener, also a painter, it was only after he was married that he discovered (or assumed) his femininity, moving to paris and starting to assume himself as a woman and using the name lili elvenes. what is certain is that he was one of the first men to undergo a surgical process of genital reconstruction, which ended with the rejection of the transplanted organ and the generalized infection that led to his death. the clinical process was burned by nazism. from that time, only a few of wegener's diaries and testimonies of those who knew him survive, material that was, after his death, collected and edited in the book “man into woman”, in 1933. far from being a biography (much less an autobiography, as it is commonly called), the book's objective was to make the public aware of the details about wegener's condition and the innovative and risky medical procedure he agreed to undergo.

conveniently, the script had just enough historical data to concoct a good melodrama, full of heartache, existential doubts, and plenty of trans-friendly material. it was what was wanted. more pragmatic issues, such as the relationship between einar and his original family and the consequences of his transition on his art, and on its acceptance by the public and the market, are never addressed. the film prefers to convey propaganda, as in the famous scene in which the character is attacked in a garden. such aggression has no logic in a city as liberal as paris and there is no historical data to sustain that wegener was assaulted or insulted in that city, where the couple moved in order to have more artistic opportunities and live the frenzy of the roaring twenties. however, in order to fulfill its doctrinal role, the film needed to give that pin to those who, today, discriminate “trans” people, so the scene was placed at a point where the public would already have a certain sympathy with the character. militant from start to finish, the film irritated me greatly. a neutral approach, faithful to the known facts and allowing the public to think for itself, would have been better.

despite not liking the way the film was conceived, i loved eddie redmayne and alicia vikander's work. they dedicated themselves, especially her, which earned her an oscar, awarded with complete justice (the question of being a supporting actress or not seems to me a minor issue, and perhaps she also thought so). the only objection i have to make is this: why not a legitimate “trans” actor for the lead role? i understand redmayne's choice, but i don't think he even looks like the real wegener. well, to be honest, i didn't like amber heard either, i think her character is left here, and it would have been better to replace her with someone closer to the main character (one of wegener's brothers, for example).

technically, the film has good production values ​​that are worth noting: the sets and costumes are excellent and recreate very well the era and the environments where the characters move, the cinematography is really very good and the choice of filming locations it was done in a very thoughtful and judicious way. the soundtrack, despite sounding mellow and slow, fits well in the film.",low
3717,"the movie blurb is written by some 20th century fox representative. i would guess that the person in question has not even watched the original movie. “legendary film makers”? what a load of bull! these people have not produced anything really worth watching and this movie certainly do not improve on that score. i mean, how dumb are these people from 20th century fox? i certainly hope the audience are not dumb enough to fall for this obvious lie. judging from the, well deserved mediocre score on various review sites i guess they did not.

anyway, as for the movie. it is a bleak (cheap) shadow of the original. it has absolutely zero of the charm that the original movie had and, most importantly, none of the characters had anything of the charisma that the original characters had. the father is a total dumbass and an irresponsible at that. the mother could by just any hollywood style housewife.

when you finally think that something interesting would happen, that is when the ghost hunter enters the scene, it just falls flat again. he is just totally lacking in appeal. he is neither a bad ass nor is he mysterious or anything else that makes him worth watching.

there are just so much things wrong with the story as well. how can this guy afford and get a one for a house when he apparently do not seem to have a job? he even manages to go for another house in the end after his original one apparently got shredded. how bloody dumb is the script writer? in the original it was a new neighbourhood which explained the “troubles”. in this one it is not which means that the script writer obviously had zero understanding of the original plot which brings us back to the same question again. what the f…?

there are some half decent cgi scenes in this movie but the same can be said for a lot of things coming out of the movie industry nowadays (well with the exception of syfy productions of course).

3742,"**the following is a long form review that i originally wrote in 2015.**

i’ll keep this’n somewhat brief, because i only saw the movie once and it was a few days ago now. some time later on though, i will post a spoiler talk that goes into greater depth. for now though, enjoy this spoiler free review of _mad max: fury road_!

the number one complaint i’ve been seeing about _fury road_ is that there’s not much of a story. i would respond by saying, there might not be as much story as you could **want**, but there is certainly as much as you could **need**. the plot isn’t deep, or complex, or intricate, or philosophical. but it’s there, and it makes sense. just last year, _john wick_ showed us that you can get away with a pretty thin premise, if you work hard enough on building a thick, palpable world. and the world of _fury road_ is something else entirely, i can see why people aren’t blown away by the story, but the world is incredible.

there has been much discussion as to whether max himself, or his cohort furiosa (played by charlize theron) is the star of the film. i would argue that neither of them are. director george miller is. this is his vision. warner brothers took a big risk when they handed a 70 year old man nearly two hundred million dollars to revitalise his franchise which has been dead for 30 years, then get out of the way and let him do his thing. but it paid off. _fury road_ is more of an “experience” than most movies are, it just happens to be a great film, too.

the stunt work and visual effects deserve praise all to themselves. according to the filmmakers, roughly ten percent of all the effects were done with cgi. the other ninety are practical, and it oozes with that spectacle. you really can feel the maximum force of the future sitting in that theatre, which is a rare and unexpected pleasure.

it’s my highest rated film of 2015 thus far, in fact, it’s one of only five films i’ve given more than 4 stars in the past five years. so please don’t take the recommendation lightly when i ask you all to go out and support this movie. just make sure you do it in the biggest, best quality cinema you can, because this latest entry to the _mad max_ franchise is worth it.

as a fan of the original, mel gibson is mad max, an there will be no other. i have no idea what was going through anyones mind when they tried to tie this to the mad max franchise, probably not much. if the movie had just been called fury road, left mad max out of it, it may have been an interesting movie in its owb right, but i think it would have been laughed at and relegated to the $1.99 bin at your local service station.",low
3744,"when i saw the reviews for this movie my first thought was ""every critic has lost their minds... even me.""

the story is about a post-apocalyptic wasteland - the fight for survival has twisted the remnants of mankind, turning most into mad, vicious gangs. in this chaotic world two rebels may be able to restore order while seeking their own forms of redemption: max, a man who just wants peace after losing his wife and child and furiosa - who thinks finding her childhood home is the answer.

what a lovely day to be talking about mad max: fury road, because the trailers and the reviews for this movie have been off the walls mad. i mean five out of five star's! wow, just wow. the last mad max film came out in 1985, so it's a been a long time and so was this movie, as development took a long time. so i was curious and a bit shady for this movie, by seeing if george miller (the director of the original films) was going to bring to the table. now after seeing the movie and having a long thought about it, this movie is freaking awesome, no actually this is the best action movie of the year and probably the decade.

george miller goes back to his roots and he doesn't disappointment. after all these years later he's still got it. he filmed all the action scenes with care and effort, because most of the action in this movie are mostly practical effects and that right there shows that miller is going back to old school of action, and it's perfect. you are the man miller!

the movie itself is mad and i do mean freaking insane. there's a guy in this movie who plays a flamethrower electric guitar on top of a speed vehicle and all through out the movie he was rocking it out. i don't know why, but little things like that made this movie so mad that it's enjoyable.

tom hardy as max rockatansky was good, i mean he wasn't as good as mel gibson but i still think he did a great job. most of the time max doesn't talk all that much, i mean most of he's lines are ""huh"", or ""water"", but he has a couple of lines in the movie and it sounded epic all the time.

charlize theron (as furiosa) is basically the main character and max is the supporting character. charlize theron was like a female version of max in a way, because her character steels the whole show as her character is a strong female bad-ass that kicks so much ass that it's very rare in action movies today to do that. now think of all the strong female character's in past action movies, well that's furiosa right here.

the action scenes can be best describe as incredible and freaking crazy. the stunt work used during the movie was f**king amazing. there actually used practical effects mixed with cgi during the action scenes which looked so good and much better than over using effect's to make something look incredible and i know they used some cgi for scenes where it needed it, because it would be too dangerous or impossible to do, but for the most part it's all practical effect's. now this is how action movies should be done! thank you mad max: fury road for doing this!!! okay, i had to get that out there and sorry for shouting.

immortan joe (played by hugh keays- byrne), and yes he was in the first mad max movie, but here he plays a different villain this time and a menacing one as well. he was like a mix of dark vader and sweet tooth from twisted metal (video game). he was awesome villain that didn't take sh*t from anyone and always looked like he was going to cause a whole lot of trouble every time he's on screen.

the cinematography was just beautiful and some of the best looking shoots so far this year. i can't believe i'm saying that for a action movie that's been in development for years and it payed off perfectly. this is very rare for this to happen as a lot of movie franchises that have been in the making for years and years would normally come out to late where every body just lost interest and give up waiting, and the movie itself would turn out not so good, but here is much different. this movie broke new grounds of coming out late but still being a amazing thrill ride.

the other women in the movie know as the five wives are not just there to look pretty and be saved by any man, no they kicked ass in the movie and they actually did something. the five wives were strong women and this isn't just a mans movie, i mean most of the movie is the women kicking ass and being awesome. they kick more ass then max ever did. that's why i got to give this movie praise for that.

now for the problems: i tried to look for things that didn't quite work for the movie and to be honest i couldn't find anything that i thought wasn't good. well there was some slow parts in the movie but the slow parts where the action clams down for now it fills it's time with character development and back story and it worked.

overall rating: forget ""pitch perfect 2"", this is the movie you should see at cinema. as a movie reviewer myself who wants action movies to be more then turn your brain off and enjoy whatever slob mess there in front of the screen, but what i want is a movie experience that i can look back on and say ""now that, was one heck of a movie.""",high
3745,"george miller brings us the fourth mad max film - ultimate carmageddon!

an apocalyptic story set in the furthest reaches of our planet, in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, and most everyone is crazed fighting for the necessities of life. within this world exist two rebels on the run who just might be able to restore order.

george miller directs and co-writes the screenplay with brendan mccarthy and nick lathouris. it stars tom hardy, charlize theron, nicholas hoult, hugh keays-byrne, rosie huntington-whiteley, zoë kravitz, josh helman and nathan jones. music is by tom holkenborg and cinematography by john seale.

well it was a long time in the making, but finally a fourth mad max movie was made and it proves to be worth the wait. undeniably light on plot, this essentially is a two hour chase movie played out to an apocalyptic backdrop of green skies, scorched orange and red vistas and the sort of storms that usually only come in nightmares. 

hundreds of crazily designed vehicles do untold damage to each other and to the barely human contingent - both goodies and baddies, the weaponary on show is vast and brutal, while the stunt work is breath taking. there's some narative stabs at redemptive force between furiosa (theron excellent) and max (hardy rightly restrained), but really this about high octane action and it's absolutely thrilling as miller's camera work rarely sits still and brings all the carnage vividly to life.

3756,"**another horror film for teenagers that will not please anyone looking for something serious.**

it looks like the teen horror movie fad has really taken root. i'm not a fan, not least because, for me, either horror movies really scare, bother, or they don't deserve to be called horror. however, if the producers' idea was to create a film capable of convincing the 15-year-old couples to go to the cinema in the hope of some naughty hugs when she gets scared, or with the intention of seeing who will be more scared in the group, maybe they got what they wanted.

for someone like me, who is part of the backstage of the catholic church, and who lived for years with all sorts of priests, it is a little difficult to understand all the “hype” around exorcism. i recognize that it is one of those catholic rituals that is unknown to even the most unfailing catholics, but this is due to the strict secrecy with which everything is done, and which aims above all to protect the person targeted by the ritual. informed catholics know that it is a special kind of ritual, that it is only done in specific circumstances and with caution, but it does not have the cinema's “show off”! it is effective in its own way, and the exorcist is not a conspicuous or strange priest. he is, above all, a priest trained to the highest level for what he has at hand (i mean the real catholic exorcists, not any cheap imitations). the film, as always happens in cinema, transforms a religious ritual into a garish show that has nothing to do with reality, but which entertains the audience quite well.

mark neveldine is not a director to be taken seriously. so far, he's only directed terribly dubious films. the cast has several good actors – djimon hounsou, dougray scott, michael peña – but none of them are used properly. the material given is poor, the characters are very bad, and the constructed narrative is a mere excuse for exorcism. the use of vcrs is also an old horror cliché, which will remind us of several films that are frankly better than this one.",low

everything is here for a quality movie of this sort, but the story isn’t captivating and doesn’t build any drive. it just goes through the motions. the script needed a serious rewrite. but vin diesel is charismatic as the witch-hunting ‘james bond’ and redhead leslie has some appeal.

3796,"""my heart bleeds. but revenge is in the creator's hands"".

the revenant is set in the 1820s, in the uncharted wilderness of america, hugh glass set out with a hunting party on an expedition. glass was mauled by a bear and left for dead but through sheer will and to get back to his family, glass survived - but that wasn't the only thing on his mind as he set out to payback the men who left him behind.

i remember last year around january time when i saw the two images for the revenant, with leo holding a kentucky flintlock rifle looking like he's not playing around. those two images straight away caught my interest. i then found out it was directed by the magnificent alejandro gonzález iñárritu who did the oscar wining ""birdman"" (a movie that i personally loved). the revenant quickly became my most anticipated movie of 2015, as i was looking forward to this movie more than star wars, and yes i said it. and after finally seeing the movie myself, i can safely say that i was not disappointed. the revenant is one of the most stunning, brutal, intense, grizzly movie experience i've ever had. the movie isn't for everyone, but i loved it.

alejandro gonzález iñárritu is starting to become my 3rd favorite director working today, because he's such an old school director when it comes to storytelling by the use of art. there's been a lot of drama happening behind the scenes of this movie, with the weather stopping the production or if someone made a mistake while filming, the crew must stop for the day and wait until tomorrow, because one mistake could lose a lot of day light for a scene (it was shot in natural lighting). one of the studios suggested that the movie should be shot using computer generated to make things much easier, but luckily iñárritu said no to the idea by stating, ""if we ended up in greenscreen with coffee and everybody having a good time, everybody will be happy, but most likely the film would be a piece of shit."" and after seeing the movie i gotta say that it was the perfect decision, because it's very rare for a director today to take that risk and avoid what the studio says. yes there are some cgi scenes, but the way that the animated effect's blended together with the practical effect's is handled incredibly well. this is one of the best directed movies i've seen in 2015 and i know iñárritu already won an oscar already, but i hope he wins another one for this, because never before have i seen a revenge tale presented so unique and utterly magnificent.

i respect leonardo dicaprio as an actor, but in this movie, he sleeps inside of a dead horse naked and eats raw food from animals, now if this doesn't get him an oscar, nothing will. he's performance in this movie is what a call 'a silent performance', because leo barley has that much lines in the movie and the only time he dose get to talk is in a different language (which leo has said it was tricky to learn the language). dicaprio has proven time and time again that he's more than a pretty face, but in this movie i only saw hugh glass, not dicaprio. that's my biggest praise i have to give to leo, as he had to deliver all the emotions, the pain and the tortured soul that hugh glass. all of that was all through his face and eyes and trust me when i say this, but it's not easy as you think. we are so use to seeing leo as the angry, pretty boy billionaire in every movie he's in, but in this movie i thought he was fantastic. he played the man who lost everything. with very little lines he had, he still manages to make a powerful performance that's so far his best. i really hope leo gets an oscar for this.

tom hardy also gave an oscar worthy performance in this movie. i've heard that some people had trouble understanding him in this movie (or just in everything that he's in really). sometimes i didn't understand what he said but for the most part i did. but all that a side, i still think he was fantastic in the movie. he really added a lot to his character, because sometimes you understand the things that he dose in movie and yes the things he dose in the movie are wrong, but in a rough environment that these people are in, you would likely do the same. i'm not sure if he would get in for best supporting actor, but i hope he dose.

i'm running out of things to say about emmanuel lubezki breathtaking cinematography. the camera work and how he makes the camera feel like a character of it's own is seriously impressive. lubezki captures nature on film, that shows it's beauty and it's unpredictable surprises. the people running the oscars should just give lubezki his third oscar right now, because he's going to take that third trophy home.

for flaws i had with the film it that some of the character logic towards the end of the movie didn't make that much senses to me. and that's it.

overall rating: ""the revenant"" is one of most intense and stunning movies i've seen in 2015. the score is haunting, the editing was top notch and that bear attack scene was just terrifying. i mean how the hell did they do that? i don't know about you, but i honestly can't stop thinking about this movie. it's one of those movies that sticks with you after it's over and it isn't going away anytime soon.",high
3797,"utterly riveting.

it's no surprise this one got/gets rave reviews - it's outstanding! <em>'the revenant'</em> isn't necessarily edge-of-your-seat viewing, though it's still a massively impactful watch as you feel every hit of hugh glass' journey. it's rather gruesome and bloody, while it also has a few top notch action sequences.

leonardo dicaprio is easily one of my favourite actors of all-time, the man is simply a sensational actor - i'm yet to see an anything less than tremendous film involving him. i wouldn't even say this is his greatest performance, and that's saying something as dicaprio is absolutely superb here.

away from the main man, tom hardy is also part of this film. he is great, as i always expect from him. he and dicaprio are fantastic actors. hardy portrays john fitzgerald, brilliantly. however, his character isn't written perfectly - not poorly by any stretch, he's just a bit flip-floppy at the beginning. the way the story creates itself involving fitzgerald being where he is isn't as amazing as it could've been - very minor criticism, mind.

another small complaint is the ending, there's nothing truly wrong with it at all but i, personally, would've concluded things about 10-15 minutes prior - there's a quality, almost quentin tarantino-esque, scene involving horses that would've made for a more thrilling end shot.

to finish, everything's beautifully crafted together visually, from a filmmaker's viewpoint, too. a marvellous film no doubt, certainly a must-watch!",high

3809,"> growing up is not the problem. forgetting is.

i usually love the french animations, because unlike american, the stories, musics, characters that influences the thousands of year cultural history. definitely not comparable to the hollywood standards, but it had its own technical brilliance. all i wondered was why this film was in english language.

it deserves to be on the upcoming's big occasion (2016 february), if it is eligible for the american academy awards. from the director of 'kung fu panda' original movie, which was partially based on the children's novel. the book adaptation is the stop-motion animation and the remaining story's the regular 3d animation.

just remember the movies like 'what dreams may come' and 'the lovely bones', those magical worlds and breathtaking landscapes. usually animations are associated with comedy genre, especially when a child character attached to it. this film was not even a comedy, more like those two titles i mentioned.

the screenplay wise it was a very 'neverwas' type, except this one was an animation. but appropriate for people of all ages. the kids can realise the importance of their childhood and the older people can become kids again. the film compressed the gap and erected a bridge between the two hoods, the childhood and the adulthood.

> ""what is essential is invisible to the eye.""

i did not know what to expect from it, but i highly satisfied with the final product. the film characters had no names, but called, the little girl, mother, fox, rose, snake, king et cetera as what their role is and species. barely there are only 3-4 characters where the story was focused. obviously it had a villain, but very unusual existence time and in a crucial part of the story.

i don't remember how the 100 minutes went so fast like a ray of the light beam flashed away. the pace of narration was not a rushy, except the opening part. but once the old man character, the aviator, voiced by jeff bridge was introduced, the movie turned into completely different and awesome. yes, jeff bridge's voice was so good for the background narration.

this story is about an old man who refused to grow up mentally and believes the existence of the magical stars and planets. the whole neighborhood stayed away from him and his troubles, until a new girl arrives at the next door. the little girl befriends him and falls for all his stories discarding her daily routines, but later it complicates their relationship after her mother finds out what they're up to. what happens to them and how the story concludes is the remaining part.

> ""she was not a common rose.
> she was the only one of her kind in the whole universe.""

this story was finely fused between the reality and fantasy. most essential storyline for the present world. in the name of education how the children were enforced by their parents to mechanical life with less time to play out and make their own friends. especially as they were lacking the creativity to make up their own fictional worlds with their toys like the kids from a century ago were.

it might psychologically affect their characters while becoming an adult like the aviator in this film, but as one of lines from the movie say 'growing up is not the problem. forgetting is', the children are losing their innocence over the adult's reality world. who knows, someday those kids may become the greatest writer inspired by their childhood days.

if you ask me, i strongly recommend it for all. it is very encouraging film for the parents how not to raise their children and for the grown ups how not to get lost is the adult world. most elegant flick of the year, along with a very few others.

you don't have to ignore it because you have read the book, like i said it was not completely borrowed from the original material. instead, two-third of the film was freshly established out of the same name masterpiece. i'm not familiar with the book, so i've no thoughts that differentiate between these two formats. but definitely the film deserved all the appreciation from critics and movie

3810,"> a 40 year old letter and the road to redemption.

first of all, the director proved the script is very important to a film's success. he wrote it, basically he's a screenplay writer who had written many great stuffs and this film is his first directional venture. he excelled it by picking the right stuffs for the project. as the great actors on-board, it was shot in the fine locations and the music was wonderful. it should have been a dream coming true for him, for a great project to work with.

the dialogues were so brilliant like the poems. i'm sure you won't end watching it without having fun because there were many small-small jokes attached everywhere. it was inspired by the real story of a person, but i think they have made some changes for a cinematic translation, hence it is not a biopic.

mainly it revolves around 4-5 characters and the cast were amazing in their respective roles. especially the al pacino, without him this film would have not been this much exciting. if you're an his ardent fan, you will going love this from your heart and others as well find it a beautiful drama-music. he was nominated for golden globe awards for his excellent title role display. a very appropriate film for him for his age.

you know in this era, film fans are looking for what superhero film is going to hit the screen, a heartwarming film like this is what makes them realise still there's a hope for small scale films. only if they're a welcoming type. especially for the yesteryears actor who are physically can't compete with the young generation actors, films like this is a breather.

this is a tale of an aging star singer who one day discovers a letter written for him by an another great singer of his generation when he was yet to taste the success. 40 years later, that mean now he decides to quit his music tour and begin to trace his family for the unfinished business. so the remaining narration reveals lots of inspiring and heartbreaking events. 

> ""if i am going to find any kind of redemption, i can't waste any more time.""

life as a singer, especially being old and seeking redemption won't quite end as expected. over the 40 years of addiction to drugs, booze and women, a self-discovery sail begins. in an unpredictable world, anything might happen and so this man's journey tells the impact on the family he's going to meet. it is not just about facing the one who he had abandoned long ago and now trying to fix it, but in reality, life is not easy, especially family means lots of commitment and choosing the best for it should be priority where this film opts that root to reveal a story.

it is almost a good family film, but for the theme the drug parts were essential, so that changed its rating. the sub-plots like how he tries to win a date add more on the romance side of the tale. kind of predictable because of the heartwarming drama, but differences were made from the twists in the narration. not of that breathtaking kind, just developed to have a fresh aspect an the well known theme. especially the ending was so simple yet very cool.

as usual bobby cannavale was in a supporting role, but it was kind of different. he shined like a star, he appeared in a well noticeable character than ever. along with jennifer garner, his performance in the film covered an important portion. so it is not just al pacino, these guys as well deserves to be appreciated for their contribution. a film that kind of resembles the recent 'ricki and the flash', except it was a male version. a product like this hard to come by, so consider to check it out. that means i'm recommending it.

3827,"a friend recommended this film to me. i was reluctant because i am no big fan of micheal keaton. but i watched it anyway purely because of the disturbing subject matter. 

clearly this cover-up resonates throughout the us a great deal, but living in england for most of my life i don't think the shocking revelations ever rang out much other than for a random story-line that probably got buried after the immediate events of 9/11.

i won't repeat the story here because other reviewers have already covered that; but what i really admired about the film was how very underplayed it felt throughout. the pacing, the somber soundtrack, the unhurried editing, even the narration all helped capture the suffocating mood of the story as it unraveled in shocking detail.

there was no histrionics that you sometimes get with films that are about to expose something deeply shocking. i am reminded of films such as ""the insider"" and ""all the president's men"" where the the lives of the investigators/victims/whistle-blowers are put into immediate danger by a ""dark force"" should they expose their findings to the public. 

but with spotlight, such things were avoided. instead everything was kept at a ""civil"" level between the boston globe and the church, even though you could feel an underlying dread or threat simmering throughout. 

i particularly liked the ending because even though the story was published and the victims finally came forward before the credits rolled, there was no big fanfare declaring how wonderful the spotlight team were in exposing this evil. instead it left us with a reminder that the abuse of children by the rc church was (and probably still is) a world-wide problem; not helped when you learn that cardinal law was never arrested, but was later reassigned to a high ranking position in the vatican, even though both he and the vatican itself was perfectly aware of the crimes committed by the church against innocent boys and girls.",high
3831,"well, that was rather disappointing unfortunately. not that i can say that i am very surprised though. the first installment in the series started off being ""okayish"" and the rest of them slid downwards towards mediocrity.  this, the final installment, is a notch below mediocre as far as i am concerned. i really cannot understand all the hype about these movies. none of them really shines even if you try to look at them as young adult movies which they really are.

this one was downright boring. there were numerous scenes where katniss or some other character was just dreaming away or sitting around brooding. it took quite a while for anything to start happening in the movie.

when something started happening it was the same mess of political, unbelievably stupid, propaganda, messy and unintelligent fight scenes, katniss walking around looking, i do not really known, disconcerted, sad, disturbed, whatever.

how the chief villains (yes plural) was one could figure out without too much effort. the moment the flyer came into the picture and started to fly over the refuges and the children not only i but all of my kids as well guessed who had sent it.

there is really only two things that i liked about this movie. one is that donald sutherland was really good. the other is the ending which, although being 100% predictable, was quite satisfying. well, that scene (everyone having seen the movie knows which scene i am referring to) is where i consider the movie to have ended. after that it was only boring filler scenes remaining.",low
3837,"> when the mountain swallowed the 33 men alive...

this is one of the greatest movie of 2015, not because of twists and turns, but pleasingly illustrating a true disastrous event. so don't listen to the negative remarks about it, ignore the low scores and just see it already. like any flick, it definitely had a few flaws, if you focus it properly, you won't be distracted for those faults in the movie. all the above, bringing that 2010's unfortunate mining tragedy on screen was a success, that's the very important.

it was not a marvel's superhero movie or a disney-pixar's cute animation that has its own large fan base to support. it is not even a hollywood, but english language movie from chile. so that's where the critics steered common people in a wrong direction. but as i'm a movie fanatic, i totally recommend it for all. this was not a simple disaster drama, but had a good amount of emotions, suspense, nationalism, light laughs, brotherhood and ultimately a good entertainment.

it is no ones biopic as it was categorised. it is a single real incident based movie, especially the book 'deep down dark'. all the characters had a fair scope and portrayed according to story growth. but it opened by introducing only a few main characters and other supporting ones out of 33 whose story this was based on.

on an ordinary day, those miners started their day as usual. for some, it was their first day and for others it was the final days of their job, but everyone had their own reasons to go into the mountain's deep down. but what they did not know was the mountain was tired of being opened its mouth for the centuries. finally, she decided to close the mouth by swallowing the 33. but those men stood against the chances they had and fought for their survival, which was finely told in this movie. what happened to them, how it concludes was narrated still the last minute with suspense.

> ""that's not a rock, that's the heart of the mountain.
> she finally broke.""

to me there was no mystery left in the main theme, because when this thing happened 5 years ago, i closely followed the event. so i know how it ended and i knew how the movie would end, but surprising parts were the families, media, politics and all the other surrounding events composed together which was a quite fresh perspective that helped the movie to help shape well. so i am telling you, if you think you know this story, you probably wrong on that assumption.

if i want to discuss about negative, that would the language of the movie. i am very-very disappointed with that choice, it must have been in the spanish. those chilean characters speaking english was kind of jokes with their funny accent. it did not work for me, because chile never was a commonwealth member. if indian, malaysian or sri lankan character speaks english would make sense. i know they wanted it to be an international product, so did they chose internationally recognisable actors like antonio banderas and julliette binoche. yes, on that aspect it paid off well.

the movie almost got me on its emotional side, i did not show it physically, but surely i felt deep inside me. it also triumphs to tell how important the families are. they are the first ones to react if you are in a real danger to rescue, to shed tears, to standby on the scene looking for your return and to hug tightly. the movie might be categorised in a couple of genres, but it had other mixed ingredients as well. for example, the scenes called the last supper and the circus outside the rescue site. movies are not all about perfection, sometimes demonstrating its purpose decently would do good enough. so on that facet i got no point to say to skip it.

an operation to capture a terrorist cell in kenya. helen mirren plays colonel who is rather gung ho and wants to take out the bad guys before they do more harm.

we also meet martha, a single gal coming off a bad break-up (isn’t everyone at the start of these movies?) and the two of them gradually make a connection. against all odds, it seems, given his mental state, he treats her quite well. their banter is witty and intelligent, with some humor coming from him telling her exactly what he does — kill people — and she naturally thinks he is kidding. she has her own surprises for us later, but i will give nothing away here.

as i have noticed with a few other movies lately — mostly action films, such as nobody — there is a ridiculous amount of violence here, almost cartoonish at times. i invented a new genre for them :bodybag movies. i guess if some viewers require such excesses, who am i to complain? i enjoyed this movie anyway. i like that he is always polite and considerate to his new girlfriend even under extreme and dangerous situations. and you know how it is neat when characters display personal growth? the surprises that emerge concerning martha that i alluded to above are part of a rather astonishing bit of character growth for her. or is ‘growth’ the wrong word?. but no, my lips are sealed. watch this entertaining comedy and see for yourself.",high

when i first read the blurb about this movie i was afraid that it was going to be a big apocalypse at the beginning and then it was going to be a “slow” search for ray’s daughter. it is nothing of the kind. it has a decent build up of suspense up to quite a few more or less spectacular earth quake scenes … and then it continues. i was pretty happy that there was a decent build up from the start but i was even more happy that the initial earth wrecking event was actually not the big event.

as i wrote at the beginning, the plot is pretty thin. the special effects are not however. at least, i liked them. not surprisingly houses a are falling over like there was no tomorrow (which for a lot of people there are not) but it is done quite well. i also liked the scenes where the earth wobbles when ray and his wife flies over it in his chopper. i found that quite cool. there are a few moments that are, well let us say not too well thought through. for instance the classical collapsing building that collapses in the just the right pace for the heroes to do there job. the we have when ray and his wife speeds through the waters of los angeles after the quake, which are riddled with trash. the amount of trash in the water would have rendered their propeller useless after a few hundred meters. but then, i think i am too much of an engineer now.

speaking of ray’s wife. that was one of the things i really did not like with the movie. maybe the movie directors and actors in hollywood are so used to divorcing all the time that they think it is a “standard” plot element and do not think twice about it but for us other “ordinary” people it is a tragedy (especially people outside of the us apparently if one should go by the trash that is spewed out from hollywood all the time) and i really do not want to watch that crap all the time in movies and tv-shows! i was actually tempted to downgrade the movie at last a star, even two, for that crap but what the heck, it is a good movie and i do like “the rock”.

i know, no one asked my opinion. i respect the movie, at least it aimed for a certain section of the audiences. the road trip was fine to me, except the music and the dance parts. thankfully, there's no nudity, except once, but still an r rated movie for strong sexual appeal.

whatever the theme was about, i expected a good story. but it was a lot like a documentary. no focus on any particular characters, but channing tatum was in a prime position. no development either in the story other than a group that embark a road trip to participate in a competition. nothing anything like the first film, kind of detached from afar.

the basic storyline itself was very weak. the characters, and their behaviours, all easily gives out the upcoming scenes. so predictable, even the twist was ordinary. the way it ended was worse than ordinary. i felt the final scene with the cops was totally unnecessary. there's nothing wrong with the actors. even filmmaking was acceptable. but i don't know how the production company okayed the screenplay. one of the low cost film, but earned better. despite not received well by all the quarters. i would always encourage such small films, but i can't suggest it.

i'm not sure when the forma should have changed from exciting to dull, probably around 1995, but it changed before that year.
and it should have changed in a productive and interesting way. 
instead, it changed to just total dullness with not one good aspect. the motivation of characters other than 007 is total zero in credibility. the inspiration is zero. the strategy is zero. the dialog is clumsy.
this is to be expected from the changes around 1970, when the writer's guild became immensely jealous of talent and good writing, and only produced the writers with zero talent.
and now those writers are the ""judges"" of new writers, god help this culture.
the change in format should have changed long ago, about 1995, into ""sons and daughters of 007"", with 007 as a background figure, say fifth or sixth billing, with his sons and daughters taking center stage in this ""less action, more computer"" world.
a lot of us said this well before 1995. it was painfully obvious, but we live in a world where hollywood went total hack in the seventies, with those hacks endorsing the worst hacks of today.
""spectre"" kind of gives us an introspective look at this with the timeline element. bond faces the usual super enemy power, and fights the establishment which brings in the computer age.
the character of 007 is the only thing that is salvaged in these new movies. it isn't daniel craig's fault that he is 007 for the worst writers, writers who are into the neo nazi ideology of the seventies where women must be blond and pale, and any man who tries to save a brunette is doomed, but save a blond, and you're a success. the hitler worship is so extreme in the modern bond movie writing that it's impossible to deny it is there. 
and the directors are pathetic. even given the ideal exotic locales, they manage to dumb down the scenery. one feels like the director actually says ""how can we make this beautiful and exotic scenery look dull and depressing? aha! i can do it!""
of course the day will come when craig will be the beneficiary of this fame and get to do actually good films for which he'll be remembered. 
this movie is pretty much formula. the action is okay enough, and it isn't as contrived to be depressing as casino royale or a view to a kill, but it is depressing and dull.",low
3898,"> an ordinary woman's life struggle that lives very close to average of us.

a very fascinating movie. depicted as a real life drama that is totally different from the other oscars nominees for this year. based on the novel of the same name, that tells the story of a young irish woman, eilis, in the 1950s who travels to the united states, brooklyn, looking for a better future. thousands of kilometers across the pacific ocean, she finds a new job, new friends, a whole new life, but what she misses is her home and family. so how she makes out of those difficulties, and finds a way to go forward is the rest.

about an ordinary woman's life struggle that lives very close to average of us. that's why i loved this film more than other drama films nominated for this oscar. the first two acts were amazing, the third was a bit off and cliche, but that's how the story rediscovered by getting back at the conclusion. i think this is saoirse ronan's full matured character as an adult woman. she was my favourite child actress and seen all her films. so felt strange to see her like this, because that's not how i remember her, but it only gets better after she does more character like this.

she was very good, in fact, she should get the oscar for the role. in my prediction, brie larson for 'room' and ronan are the top contenders, but if cate blanchett wins that'll be a great disappointment. i'm also expecting adapted screenplay awards. the cinematography was fantastic, those 50s new york city really brought back on the screen. it is a must watch, especially if you're a middle aged guy, because you're well experienced about personal and social life already, and this movie only a reminder.

a beautiful and moving film. a love story that draws you in, and is told so well that you care about the characters almost immediately. the photography and the close-ups are really beautiful, and the camera loves saoirse ronan. she leaves ireland and she is off to america, (brooklyn). her trip to america is shot so economically, yet powerfully, you could feel what it must have been like on that ocean liner. homesick and missing her widowed mum and sister she makes a home for herself in brooklyn. but will she stay in brooklyn? the cast is amazing, julie waters, jessica pare, and jim broadbent, to mention a few. the wardrobe was authentic, and the soft warm colors seemed to give this film a dreamlike feeling. but in the end it was all about saoirse, she carried this film, there was never a false moment. when she was homesick, you knew it, you could feel it. i love ""brooklyn"".",high

3965,"> a small accident can lead to a great achievement, but difficult path is certain.

it is a semi-biographical film about a person who invented a modern hygienic mop. so all the depicted events and characters were partially real, but for the cinematic reason they have been fairly altered for a good outcome. and yes, i loved it. a very inspiring film among all the oscars nominees this year. in some way i also felt jennifer lawrence should have got the award for her fine character display.

honestly, i was not interested in this, so i wanted to get over it silently as soon as possible. but i ended up enjoying a lot and instantly it became one of my favourites of the 2015. what i expected after watching its trailer was like i judged it by its cover. as i hesitated in the earlier, but strangely now i'm recommending it to all.

the story of a woman who grew up listening her grandmother's motivational speeches. but realises the life is tougher than she thought and making a living is very competitive. after so many struggles in the life, she finally invents something that changes her and her family fortune forever. but like any new initiative does face, the problems arise and how she is going to fix them is what the remaining film narrates.

a very interesting film in the perspective of the career option. forget the doctors, engineers, lawyers and those who're settled in their lives with a good job in hand that pays big, but there are billions of people, to them it will definitely serve as an inspiration to ignite their future.

the rating for this looks like a fair value, but still a very underrated film everywhere. amazing actors, a little funny and a little emotional, but a very impressive film directed by the one who bought the oscars to jennifer lawrence for their earlier venture together. i don't know what's between her and bradley cooper, but looks like their onscreen chemistry is doing something big impact. this is their's fourth project together and second with the director, so i hope they do more in the future as well. this is really a wonderful film, so don't miss it.

in the last few years i have not got tired to praise in my review for those my childhood tv favourite cartoons successfully transformed into 3d animations. after 'tintin', 'doraemon', 'asterix', 'mr peabody' 'winnie' and a few others, now this movie joined the club. i'm waiting for many more like 'garfield', 'kim possible', 'calvin & hobbes' et cetera to make its way.

'peanuts' characters considered one of the beautiful cartoon characters, just like 'calvin & hobbes'. they're simple drawings, yet very cute and delightful. these are mostly best suited to render in 2d animation, so till i watch them in 3d i always had a curiosity and doubts. this film is still a mix of both styles  - like eyes, mouth, dusts and in the side view, it was 2d drawing, but overall characters and backgrounds are 3d.

it was so good movie, for the 90 minutes i became a child again. as usual, there were two tales, one was snoopy's fictional account and the others' charlie brown's crush on a little red-haired girl. both of them were great, but i liked charlie's a lot.

once the animation was considered only for the kids, but now the world sees it differently. this film had an excellent box office. so definitely there will be a sequel. my only upset is it failed to do good at annie awards, but anyway, like disney studio says, that award ceremony is a joke and a disgrace to animation and animation (movie) fans.

3976,"slumber earthquake.

there really is no point trying to do an in depth review of this, it falls in line with a number of series blockbusters that are guaranteed to garner rabid responses, pro and con. 

the force awakens is a film of many flaws, it has a pungent whiff of safeness about it, the charges of it being a glitzy remake are fair enough, while certain plot strands are frustrating and set to be big talking points for years - and years - to come.

yet what about its worth to someone who is not obsessed with every finer detail? someone who just loves the star wars universe as a spectacle prism of entertainment, and has just wanted a star wars film worthy of being fit to sit alongside that original trilogy?

this made me feel 11 again, took me back to a time in 1977 when i queued for three hours to see such wonders on the big screen. the force awakens is, in spite of the recognised flaws, a loving homage to a past love. it's sly with humour and nods to foundations, a blitzkrieg of effects and sound work (my blu-ray viewing had my sub-woofer doing a jitterbug in the lounge), and it doesn't shy from surprise or the dangling of the carrot.

the makers have big heart and technical invention, the cast vibrant, spunky and strongly committed to the cause - the old hands a very reassuring presence - yeah, so it's not sci-fi perfection, or any star wars geeks' idea of the perfect star wars movie (oh j.j. abrams you devil you!), but it made this middle aged guy shed a tear of happiness. a moment to reaffirm why - as a young lad - i fell in love with film in the first place. 9/10",high

star wars: episode viii - the last jedi (2017) was just released, but my time didn't yet allow me to watch it. however, i do have time to review the film that started this new trilogy: the force awakens. at the time, it was my most anticipated movie of the year and i placed it second on the list of my favorite films of 2015 (just a bit below mad max: fury road).

so, yes, i do love this movie and it is definitely on the top3 of the saga! the cast choices are the undoubtful proof of the huge success that this film achieved. daisy ridley (rey) is a massive discovery, her talent is limitless and she embraces her role like no other. she delivers a very emotional and powerful display, showing all of her acting skills. i can feel that she is 100% committed to her character and what a character to portray at your first big movie appearance.

rey is excellently-developed throughout the film, she might mislead people into thinking she is just a mere scavenger, but once the movie gets going, she becomes an awesome character sharing some of the most epic moments in the whole runtime. she has an oddly mysterious backstory, which is going to produce theories and plot twists that i can't wait for, in the next films.

john boyega (finn) is a fantastic supporting actor and another great casting. he brings just the right amount of humor with some exceptionally delivered lines and his facial expressions and timing are perfect. finn is going to be one of the audience's favorites for sure, his journey to encounter rey is interesting and unique in the saga. in my opinion, it is his story that carries the beginning of the movie and that sets up a lot of characters and plot points.

adam driver as kylo ren ... oh. my. god. what a performance! driver is so subtle in the most meaningful moments but so compelling in the most menacing ones. he elevates ren into a phenomenal antagonist with a splendidly written script. j.j. abrams and co. do a wonderful job writing both the plot and the characters. kylo ren stands out, he is a multi-layered character with so much untold and hidden behind his personality and intriguing past. once again, there are many theories and plot twists ahead that i'm drooling to know which one they are going to follow with.

oscar isaac is very exciting as poe dameron, another fabulous addition to the franchise. his character creates an honest bond with finn and their interactions are pretty cool. they share some amazing scenes and poe has all of the awesome x-wing fights, which are outstanding. supreme leader snoke (andy serkis) does not show up that much, but he definitely is a very threatening presence and a very well achieved motion capture work.

as for the original cast/characters, harrison ford has one of his best performances in the more recent years. han solo is one of his most popular characters and he portrays him flawlessly. carrie fisher returns as leia and she offers a touch of reality to all of this. every time she is on screen, everything becomes more realistic and tangible due to her graceful and humble display. chewbacca has the usual funny ""dialogues"" with solo and some glorious action set pieces.

bb-8 is what people feared the most since he could easily be annoying or irrelevant. thankfully, he is another checkbox on the list of marvelous additions to the star wars universe. it is mind-blowing how a droid can provide so much laughter and terrific action scenes, he is unquestionably a toy worth spending your money on for christmas. c-3po also appears and elevates the level of nostalgia that everyone is already full of.

moving to the technical aspects of the film, j.j. abrams proves himself to every single person that doubted him since he is the main reason why this movie is one of the greats. from the seamless editing to the great camera work during the impressive action sequences, he enhances the story so much with his distinct use of visual storytelling. it feels like a real film and not just a star wars typical movie.

the visual effects are top notch and the cinematography could not be better due to the unbelievable practical backgrounds. abrams uses a lot of long, wide shots with beautiful landscapes and mostly everything is real (besides the obvious, there is very few cgi, less than you probably think), which transforms every scene, every shot, into something more special. the tone is very well balanced between comedy and action, the storytelling process is astonishingly well handled and the pacing always maintains the tremendous excitement.

one of the common issues of all star wars films are the excessive exposition scenes. well, j.j. massively improves on that aspect having just a couple of them and i am counting the traditional text that starts the movie. like i said above, there is an extensive use of visual storytelling, in other words, everything that you see is giving you information while advancing the plot without actually literally telling you what is going on or what is going to happen.

john williams' score continues to superbly accompany every scene, not only the action ones, but it also strengthens dialogues. i love the ending, but here is where both fans and critics are going to become very divisive. it ends with a huge cliffhanger and some people are going to be disappointed because they are left with this feeling of unfulfillment and if you don't know how to deal with it, you might think you didn't enjoy the film.

the truth is you can't have everything right now. this is a trilogy, so it is absurd to even expect that you are going to have everything that you wish for in the first movie of a new era. i wanted more from the second the film finished, i also felt a bit let down because the movie concludes with something i had been expecting forever. however, this is a great feeling to have because it means the film meant something, it means the movie was so amazing that i just can't wait anymore for the next one!

nevertheless, the force awakens can't escape some minor flaws. while pretty much every single character is great, maz kanata (lupita nyong'o) is not. with so much practical effects surrounding every environment, a 100% cgi character is going to (negatively) standout.  besides, the whole subplot involving meeting with maz feels a bit unnecessary and the story could have easily progressed without her.

however, my main issue with this film is its lack of originality when it comes to creating a new actual danger for the galaxy. i mean, the starkiller base is essentially another death star, just bigger ... really? they couldn't figure out anything else besides another giant planet destroyer? it does not reflect j.j. abrams' incredible direction and the production team's excellent work, at all.

finally, there are some ""problems"" that i don't yet know if they are, in fact, problems. this is the first movie of the trilogy and some things happened that i don't know how or why they did, so i can't really fault the screenplay ... yet. we all know the huge plot device that episode iv - a new hope (1977) supposedly had for decades, but then rogue one: a star wars story (2016) was released and brilliantly solved what was already considered an internet meme.

this film does not have such a massive plot device, but there is one little moment that occurs in the first act that i still don't know if it is, in fact, a flaw or if there is an explanation waiting for us in the next movies.

all in all, the force awakens proves that the star wars franchise is still, very much, alive! this is easily one of the best films of 2015 and one of the best in the franchise. it features an outstanding cast with some excellent performances from the new actors joining the saga and powerfully nostalgic displays from the original members. incredibly-developed characters carry this movie with the help of a mysterious and captivating screenplay, as well as a lot of visually exciting action sequences. j.j. abrams has his stamp all over the film, with beautiful wide shots, massive practical effects, and exceptional use of visual storytelling. a cheap third death star and some very minor issues here and there don't allow the movie to shine flawlessly, but it is still freaking awesome! it undoubtedly belongs to my top3, behind empire strikes back and a new hope.

3983,"it's sure to be a bone of contention...

written and directed by s. craig zahler, bone tomahawk stars kurt russell, patrick wilson, matthew fox, richard jenkins and lili simmons. music is by zahler and jeff herriott and cinematography by benji bakshi.

ah, yes, the horror western hybrid, a most difficult thing to get right at the best of times, even harder to entice newcomers to the sub-genre splice if they don't particularly like horror or westerns! this is a tough sell, a pic of startling originality, but of homage worthiness as well, that it kind of feels like a film made for a secret society of film fans. a society perhaps like the troglodyte tribe who dominate the horror aspect of this particular tale.

plot is set in the wild west, where after a set of circumstances leads to the kidnapping of three people from the local jail - by members of the troglodyte tribe, four men set off on a rescue mission...

how splendid to find a narrative that isn't afraid to nod towards one of the most revered westerns of all time, yet be its own entity at the same time. bone tomahawk will polarise opinions, no question about it, the whole middle section involves a travelogue pumped by characterisations and a need to set the stage for what will occur in the final third. however, to even think that the four horsemen of the apocalypse bulk of this movie is mere slow time cinema is unfair, for dark comedy is at work - a racist horse? surely not?. 

so the screenplay not only sparkles with wit, but it also pulses with drama, drama that comes from human stubbornness. be it men who know that no matter what will happen, they will maybe die in honour due to mistakes or mismanagement, or just a matter of redemption, this mission on the surface seems pure folly, but in reality there is more at work here. and thus comes the horror, characters have been well formed, we know them and are interested in what will happen to them. like or dislike is irrelevant, we bloody know them, so as the film hits its raging ""b"" movie straps, shouting at the screen or wincing in harmony becomes a requisite. as is squirming...

intricately paced, beautifully photographed and splendidly performed by a top cast who aren't interested in top billing or walk of fame recognition, bone tomahawk is a grade ""a"" culter. zahler could be someone to keep an eye on. 9/10",high

4003,"ted 2 packs more unhumorous stuffing within its formulaic synthetic fur. macfarlane is a talented comedian, i’m sure of it. his profusely crude humour captivating millions with his legendary ‘family guy’ tv show. even ‘ted’ was tolerable to a certain degree, and that’s saying something. yet here we are, with an inevitable sequel, that essentially felt like a glorified episode of the aforementioned animation. it’s cutaway structure for unrelated gags. relentless wave of pointless cameos. ted becoming peter griffin. close your eyes, let the voices infiltrate your senses and you’ll soon realise it’s just ‘family guy’, just less funny. ted now married and struggling to maintain his relationship, has his rights taken away when he is no longer viewed as person but property instead.

a particularly strong aspect to this comedy that more or less is the power source of its story, raising a civil rights lesson in ethics and morality. it was so *interesting* that morgan freeman himself got involved and slam dunked the jury with his god-like soothing voice. and despite seyfried actually picking up the script’s remnants and transforming the scraps into a functional film, it’s utterly forgettable. so much so, that once wahlberg becomes drowned in rejected semen samples (literally swimming with the sperm...), i experienced a moment of déjà vu (ironically, so did ted). surprisingly, i had seen the first half before. yet it took me a decent forty minutes to encounter this epiphany, that’s how unmemorable this comedy truly is.

it exercises all of the same plot points from its predecessor, the inclusion of the mentally unhinged donny and the friendly break-up between the leads cement this sentiment, and rarely explored new avenues. sure the friendly chemistry remained intact, but only one or two lines made me frustratingly chuckle, mostly due to warburton’s comedic execution (urgh, that voice...). besides that, there’s nothing here. same old macfarlane profanity. worth a squeeze if you enjoyed the first film, but exhausts its preset lines of dialogue extremely rapidly. “i love you”? eh, please don’t.",low

the first film was good, i enjoyed it, but not scary. so a sequel was expected and it failed to live up to the standards of the original. i would say, it was a decent horror film, with more story and drama than the creepy atmosphere. one character retained from the previous and the core theme remained, but tried a different method of narration. something like 'goodnight mommy' with two brothers and mystery events surrounding them.

it definitely lacks what a horror film required the most, and predictable too. but the story wise, it was decent, because the actors did a good job. so it is an average film. i expected a better ending and it did not conclude at its best leaving me disappointing. the way it ended might have been the suitable for the story, but i wasn't impressed. again, another sequel is most certain, so i think this tale is not over yet and chances are very high that the story would follow with the same cast.

it was not a bad flick, but not a follow-up you would have wanted. if you're looking for a genuine horror film, then you should skip it. there's nothing brilliance to appreciate at any level. overall, i too felt it should have been better in some places. so my advise is if you forget its genre and try to enjoy that you're watching some movie that you don't know its category then surely would have a decent time with it.

'sinister 2' was quite scary in places. no doubt, the cinema playing the film super loud helped elevate the jump scares though. the creepy depictions of murder in the first film were crazily overdone in this.

the screenplay was terrible. the main story was stale and predictable and the characters were unsympathetic and cold.

4022,"this is one of those movies where the french decided on an english name but for some inexplicable reason the original english name was not good enough for them. so in france it is called fast & furious 7 but i believe it is called furious seven in the us. typical french way of doing things i am afraid.

this movie is probably not for everyone. it is very typical for the latest fast & furious movies though. the movie can be summed up by explosions, fast cars, fighting, did i mention explosions, repeat until credits roll. for me it was just what i expected and just what i wanted from this particular movie as well. if you are into fast cars, lots of action and explosive special effects and a bit of male macho talk then this movie will please you just fine.

the gang is back. i have to confess that i like both vin diesel and dwayne johnson even though they are rather far from shakespeare material as far as acting goes. for this kind of movie they are perfect though. unfortunately dwayne johnson was absent for a good chunk of the movie. when he came back from his brief presence in the beginning of the movie he did so with a vengeance though. i was actually expecting to dislike “mr nobody” but i have to say that i quite liked him.

despite the fact that this is a macho action movie there is at least a small kernel of story in there. it is a classical revenge story but it is embellished with enough material to make it fairly decent. well, decent within the confines of this kind of movie of course. seen from a reasonable point of view the entire movie is of course totally ludicrous. the stunts are really cool but if you sober up from the adrenaline feast you rather quickly find a lot of the stunts pretty far out. like jumping between buildings in fancy cars and such like. even if we skip the most ridiculous scenes there are plenty more to nit-pick about. like the fact that those old, but cool, american cars that torretto drives would not have a chance in hell against his more modern adversaries unless possibly if the road was entirely straight. but then, these ridiculous things are what the fast and furious series is all about is it not?

4027,"> losing that you love makes you realise its value.

the only reason to i go to nick is to watch 'shaun the sheep'. this show was watched by many adults as well, a popular one among all the ages. as the fan of this series, we have been waiting very long to get a movie version. i was excited to see it and of course enjoyed it completely. its impossible one to get disappointed with the movie/show when the narration is led by one of the awesome characters, shaun. the promotional posters were also created some extra curiosity that imitated the famous hollywood films like 'boyhood', 'wild', 'birdman' and many others.

stop-motion is a very-very hard and outdated concept of the animation format, but still loved by many. every year only one or two get released, sometimes none. the technical sides were upgraded, including bluescreens for backgrounds and other special effects. still the hard work remains, but qualities are improved. it made significant contributions to the live-shot movies in the old days when there was no cgi. so when we see a movie like this, the product reveals in each and every frames the real vision from the artist and writer's perspective. every detail, every corner of the screen tells the story.

it was so good as a television show, because of short and sweetness. the filmmaker intended to create the same magic, except the credits its just a below 80 minute movie. had a good storyline and a couple of new characters were introduced. because the new adventure extended its area volume and so the antagonist was needed. shaun and his buddies set foot outside their barn to find their lost farmer. the journey begins towards the big city and the movie discloses their risky and dangerous undertaking. they go pass lots of stages to accomplish their quest and only the last quarter reveals result with a thrilling chase scene.

unlike the series, it was not completely a fun movie. there are some emotions involved, and i was amazed by those exhibitions. because of some kind of childhood connection between shaun and co and their owner. that was unexpected, but was really very nice to see the other side of them. we know shaun is a curious character, he always wants to learn and try new things. so when he has to make an unexpected decision, it does not go as planned and the fun begins with their mischievous adventure in an unfamiliar territory.

as usual without the dialogues, that can be understandable by everyone without a language barrier. a true family movie, from grandparents to grandchildren together watchable flick. almost a masterpiece, offers a lot of great moments to give ourselves to it. and for the fans its a celebration time for sure. definitely this movie would get into the final shortlist for the upcoming (2016) oscars, if not, that would be a shame for the entire ceremony. but for winning, we have to wait till how good 'the good dinosaur' going to be. in the meantime, don't miss this little cute flick.

4046,"> it's a women's revenge movie, definitely not a 'transporter'.

there are hundreds of reasons to say it did not look like a fourth film in the 'transporter' series. one such was the cast, especially the title role that replaced jason statham and the rest as well not very convincing. the stunts were just good, but sometimes it was annoying. the overall movie is even worse than the 'agent 47'.

from now on, this franchise will downgrade if they fail to bring back statham. recently plenty of franchise rebooted than ever, so i thought the fever hit for this one as well. but no, it is simply a next installment and worst part in the series from a far distance.

i'm not against bringing a bunch of fresh faces and crew on board, but the structured planning was not good. the storytelling and especially it is missing the originality, the stylish tone that set by mr statham. that's how everyone remembers this franchise. all i wanted was to upgrade to a higher level by carrying the original legacy.

i think, 'transporter' is a trilogy. the following ones are simply the b films from the tier-two filmmakers to experiment with their skill under the limited budget. the announcement of the cast and crew for the next film will reveal whether it climb back to its glory or keep falling. but for now, to the 'transporter' fans, it is done.

the entire story was told from the henry's perspective, i mean what he sees through his eyes are the visuals we get. the first person point of view. like the video games, but you won't play, just sit back and watch it. so you won't see the henry's face, because he's you and you won't utter a word. that character was actually performed by many stuntmen and their risky stunt sequences pay off so well. that means, the main character is the cinematographer of the film. so all the credit must go to them for doing multiple task at a same time.

it is a one day event based narration. all about running and chasing, right from the beginning. along the way it lets us know why it's taking place and who's behind it. the rest of the cast was too amazing, especially that south african actor of 'district 9' fame was simply brilliant with different getups. i also enjoyed the russian locations which were something refreshing.

the story was simple, but puzzled. they explained nearly everything, yet a few doubts remain with us. so i'm expecting a follow-up, more than that i want it to be a trilogy and nothing less. for the sequel, put us in the cinema hall, but give us virtual reality headset, i think that's how the future of cinema should be, especially for this film.

very unique and craziest film, one of the best of this year. it was kind of similar to statham's 'crank', as well as good as that one. if you like action films, then surely you would love it. especially if you're a gamer, then it will be a double treat. the americans did not show interest in this like usual which is not hollywood or british. especially critics never appreciated the creativity, but this is a must see film and the rest of the world accepted the truth. so don't think of skipping it.

this is one of the most unique and interesting sci-fi action movies i've ever seen.  doing the entire movie from first person perspective is an amazing feat all on its own.  if you watch carefully, then the cuts are really subtle if they even exist in places where you would expect them to be.  there are a few points of lost consciousness, but those are the more obvious ones.

because it is a ""first person"" movie, andrei dementiev literally carries the movie through the camera, but sharlto copley (""district 9"") is the repeating character that helps drive most of the movie, so he would be the traditional carrier, as opposed to the mute camera.  danila kozlovsky and haley bennett give great supporting roles as well.

the problem with the main character being ""super powered"" is that they need drawbacks to balance their benefits so they can ""power creep"" to match / exceed the villain by the end of the movie, and this follows that formula really nicely and in unexpected manners, unless you've seen ""crank 2: high voltage"".

4063,"creed hits all the best notes of the original rocky, while also being able to step out from its shadow to deliver a nearly perfect film.

from start to finish, this movie had me invested. it was a brilliant choice to make apollo creed’s son the lead of the new franchise. on the surface, adonis creed should have it all in terms of wealth and security. but due to him being a bastard child, his life was a struggle, giving him the same hunger that rocky had in the original, which i thought was done really well.

the chemistry between all of our characters is spectacular throughout. there is a deep sense of care that rocky (sylvester stallone) and adonis (michael b. jordan) have for each other. rocky and adonis develop a close father-son relationship as rocky attempts to fill the void left by his estranged relationship with his son, and adonis sees rocky as the father figure he's never had. this connection creates some fantastic dramatic story beats that had me on the verge of tears. bianca (tessa thompson) is a fantastic addition to the cast and creates that motherly figure for our two leads. these three take on the roles of rocky, adrian, and mickie from the original while also having their own unique presence. my one complaint is that the opponent, ""pretty"" ricky conlan, is pretty underdeveloped, but the main focus is really on the dynamic between rocky and adonis, so this wasn’t a huge drawback for me.

the fight choreography is insane in this film; it is without a doubt the best of the series. there is a boxing matchup in the middle of the film that is one take with some incredible angles; it completely immersed me. the ending is really well done, with a super long buildup that had me genuinely nervous for adonis.

the score is fantastic. there are still similar notes from the original rocky that are subtly present throughout the film. but they are mixed together with contemporary rap beats and rhythms that give the film a modern feel. it is a great homage to the past while also being true to the culture of our lead character.

overall, this film surpasses rocky in almost every way and goes down as the best in the series. i am utterly blown away with how much i enjoyed this.

melissa is something very similar, and she is perfect for her role as an analyst that has to work undercover, taking the place of all other agents whose identities have been revealed to the ""enemy"".

4075,"> discovering a whole new world beyond the 4 walls.

we all know the german folk tale 'rupanzel', and this is a similar kind with entirely different motive. all the above it is not a fairy tale set in the medieval period, but inspired by many real events of the present era. a couple of years ago i saw a german movie called '3096 days' based on the true story. when i heard of this movie is being made, at first obviously i remembered that title, but after seeing the poster alone convinced me not the same. automatically the expectations rose, and now it's got the 4 oscars nominees, including the best motion picture.

the both halves of the movie were entirely different from each other like the two sets of story, but the core of the theme remains same. the first half was a crucial part that takes place completely in a single room with a minimal cast. it does not go through the intro, just begins to tell the story like it's already happening and you might take a few minutes to realise the state of condition. the next half is a reaction to what happened in the previous. and again this is also an important storytelling section because like the title, it was not all about the room, but beyond that 4 walls and its roof and floor like how it affected the mother and son.

> ""if you don't mind, it doesn't matter.""

the movie does not talk about the crime feature at all. not even considered to reveal behind the motive. so the other side mystery remains as it is. the whole narration was one sided, everything was seen through the eyes of a five year old boy. he begins with the line 'once upon a time...' like a fairy tale, because it is to him and with his cute little performance along with brie larson's, the movie briefs their struggle for freedom.

it was a too casual opening, like nothing bad is really happening, just they're weird people or maybe agoraphobia, except they're not. you know when we say we love to be kids again to escape this complicated adult life, sometimes we won't mean it except it was a normal reaction to the situation we're in. but what if a five year old boy wants to be four again when her mother thinks its time to him know what the real world looks like. yeah, that's a too much to take in for a young boy, but that's the best chance they had to break free from the psycho who put her mother in that room.

> ""when i was small, i only knew small things.
> but now i'm five, i know everything.""

it was a tidy place, but the camera angles were impressive. i know it was shot in a studio with a wide open space behind the camera, but that does not the viewpoint in the actual story. when the first half ends, it is an indication of the good parts are over, at least that's what i thought of, but what came after was the unexpected expansion in narration. usually most of the similar tales end in that part itself like for example 'prisoners' and the rest is understandable stuff that won't be shown.

when a tale had a ending like 'happily ever after', still some people desire for it to continue a few more minutes to know how happy really they are and that's what this film's second half.  remember, most of the similar themes have multiple perspectives, like how victim's family is coping with, cops are pursuing the suspect, abductor's plans and motive, and captives struggle. like i said it was all about what a mother and her son goes through those years in captivity and after that.

there were some suspicious characters and events like i had a bad feeling over the doctor's soft talking, also the mother-son's master plan when in captive. those are tiny diversions to viewers assume differently against where the story is heading. it is all about the mother and son's mental trauma, especially for the little boy similar to when tarzan is in a big town for the first time leaving behind his other life. it was a perfect pace as well, neither hurried nor a slow development. the movie was a big break for many, especially for the irish director, and brie larson and of course for the kid. definitely one of the finest movie of 2015 and a must watch.

4076,"""i want a different story!""

that line and the scene it's taken from is quintessential to what this movie is about — at least to me.

to me, this is so much **not** about being abducted and trapped in a room but about the apparent pointlessness of being, about coming to terms with it and understanding and accepting that any meaning that is to be found, comes from within ourselves. it's also about moving on, about love and parenthood (""can i?"" ""there's nothing left.""), and just... well, humanity and love.

it reminds me of the beautiful relationship between father and son in the road (the book — i don't remember if the movie conveys this relationship very well, but i do remember the beauty of it in the book). the relationship between mother and son in this movie is heartbreakingly beautiful as well.

also, i don't remember the last time i've seen a child perform this well in a movie. i have a feeling i've seen better, but i can't remember having seen better.

4084,"one's a falling angel - the other one's a rising devil.

slow west is written and directed by john maclean. it stars kodi smit-mcphee, michael fassbender, ben mendelsohn, caren pistorius and rory mccann. music is by jed kurzel and cinematography by robbie ryan.

it's the late 1800s and a teenage scottish aristocrat travels to the american west to track down the girl he loves with all his heart...

there has been a number of modern day directors who have not only refused to let the western genre die, but also to not be afraid to take it to a harshness of the west level. they have chosen to strip it back to a sense of realism, with no frills and bunting, just a show of tough times populated by tough people and people tough out of luck. slow west is one such oater.

for his first full length feature, john maclean has chosen to make a genre of film he clearly knows something about. it's got some familiar tropes - greenhorn, grizzled bounty hunter, deadly gang et al, but maclean has still made a fresh picture, one that not only intrigues and excites, but also humours by way of some black comedy inserts.

essentially it's a travelogue piece, mcphee's lovelorn jay cavendish ends up being escorted on his journey by fassbender's mysterious tough guy silas selleck. it's an odd yet engaging pairing, and as they are pursued by selleck's old gang, and they come across a number of eccentric or devious characters, you may find yourself hoping that all the hidden agendas - the secrets bubbling away in the background - do not shatter the surrogate relationship neither was looking for.

his heart was in the wrong place.

ah, but yes! maclean shows gumption to go all mud and blood on our butts, building everything to a quite terrific final quarter of film that has rode in on a black stallion straight from noirville. no printing the legend here, it's a bitter commentary on the romanticised view of the old west. western fans keen of ear will pick up on some historically spiky dialogue exchanges, whilst also noting the nods towards the immigration angles, where maclean doesn't pull punches as to how desperate the old west was for many of those who travelled hoping for a better life.

predominantly filmed in new zealand (superbly standing in for the american west), the panoramic cinematography is stunning, while it's great to see the backdrops are not just mountainous desert scapes, this journey goes through forestry as well. cast are on prime form, fassbender seems to be a given these days and it's hoped he will do a western again, and mcphee plays off of him with genuine conviction. then there's mendelsohn, who has to be one of the finest australian character actors working today, he's perfectly cast here, so his fans know exactly what they will be getting.

the poster art is hugely frustrating, showing caren pistorius with a big beaming smile on her face, that is very much a bum steer. you would be wise to take more note of the faces of messrs mcphee, fassbender and mendelsohn on that poster, for their facial portraits are more in keeping with this cracker-jack western. 9/10",high

based on the real life story of a nigerian forensic pathologist dr. bennet omalu who discovered cte disorder that most of the american football players are suffering from. so he fought for his theory against the nfl who was denying it. i was neutral when #oscarssowhite broke out, but for this movie i definitely agree on that. whether he would have won or not, will smith name should have been in the best male actor in the lead list.

that's not at all, this movie did not qualify for any other category in the event which is not unfortunate, but deliberately the academy chose a wrong side to stand. felt like they are supporting nfl instead of fact and its own product. this biographical movie talked mainly about one particular sport, maybe there are other sports in the globe that might cause cte as must as this one. since dr. omalu's research came from nfl players, so it was all about between them.

this is a wonderful movie, i was very surprised for it. in the past, every good thing in the world was always opposed in its beginning, but later accepted widely like the global warming. i hope people aware of such thing is exist and act accordingly. no need to abandon the sport, just change the rules and the style of play. this is one of the best movie you could find from the 2015. i think it is a must see biopic, the credit must go to ridley scott who is the man behind for this movie to happen.

this was really a great film. fighting against the drug trafficking was the theme. the story of an fbi agent who was recruited to work in an elite force that no one knows its existence. their's aim is to tackle the main source, instead to deal with its lower order. something that impossible to do without international cooperation. every raid is done in secretively, sometime if required at any cost in whatever effort to stop it. like i said, this was an awesome movie, and good to see it after the documentary like 'cartel land'.

the story is kind of hard to detail it out, because it was more an action movie than the talking. how a special force unit goes after the bad guys and stops them is the main plot. but the characters were so distinctive, every main roles had their own agenda for what they are doing and that's how the narration dominated with the high standards.

the cast who played them were simply outstanding, including that starts with emily blunt, who is someone looks changed the attitude to play physically challenging roles after 'edge of tomorrow'. and then josh brolin and another one, an upcoming young british actor who i really don't know, but benicio del toro was actually the show stealer.

his part was unexpectedly great, totally raw and aggressive. especially the his end scene, no one could have guessed it, but that's how the way it is. no doubt any top actors would have denied to perform that, anyway well shot with minimum violence, but the intention was very clear as fighting against the dark forces to cut off the head first. one of the best movie of the year, so definitely recommended if you're interested.

they did not get a decent story. even the film characters, including the villains were too old fashioned. even this film had made in the 90s, might have not received well too. the concept of going vacation-come-convention, we had seen this before, are not we! yeah, paul after his short marriage and losing mother, he and his daughter heads to las vegas. being watchful father and meeting his old friends, the adventure begins, when some criminal activity is going on behind the conference. his plan to save his daughter, as well as thwart the crime are the remaining focus of the film.

i felt for a character like paul blart, casting raini rodriguez as his daughter was a little too much intentional. yeah, the film was full of television guys every corner. its not just direction, or performance failed, it was the writing. this kind of comedies is now considered ancient, that's why rowan atkinson stopped doing his routine comedies. but now it's certain that there won't be a third. if you had seen the first and not sure about this, believe me, you won't miss anything. instead, i would suggest you to re-watch the original. that ain't a masterpiece, though a much better one.

as they did in the first film, james co-wrote the screenplay with comedian nick bakay, so the laughs should be here. it's weird that james doesn't seem to have a handle on his own creation. is paul a stupid oaf, or a genius detective trying to break out of his boring job? here, we get both characteristics. his arrival in vegas and dealings with the casino staff is supposed to be fish-out-of-water funny, but fall flat because james plays paul as a sociopathic jerk. i could not stand this guy. the only scenes i smiled at were when hotel manager divina (daniella alonso) kept finding herself attracted to paul, and even that running gag didn't get going until after their first awkward encounter; and muhrtelle (bob clendenin), the casino employee with the banana. the film is rated (pg) and family friendly, so the violence here are guns with silencers that never hit their target, and paul falling down a lot. a supporting roster of familiar faces and character actors- look at that cast list!- stand around and watch paul fall down a lot. paul falling down a lot isn't that funny. the wynn resort is nice to look at and makes for a great action film setting, but this is not that action film. i don't see another ""paul blart"" film on the horizon, this one did poorly at the box office, but since it was released six years after the mediocre first film, you never know.",low

wyoming, wintertime, and an assortment of suspect characters are holed up at minnie's haberdashery while a blizzard rages outside. soon enough suspicions and ugly human traits come to the fore... 

tarrantino is on a western/southern/oater/civil war kick these days, here following on from django unchained, this is set just post the civil war. proudly homaging genres he loves, he throws all his trademarks at the hateful eight for glorious results - that is on proviso you happen to be a fan of his in the first place. 

picture is split into two halves. first half sets up the characters who come to be at minnie's, the conversations are pungent with tarrantino's caustic and comedic writing, the characterisations equally so, whilst we have been treated to some absolutely gorgeous colorado vistas. there's a constant sense of mistrust in the air, while racism, misogyny and political fall outs pulse away in set up scenarios. 

then it's the second half, where after a wee bit of narration that had me thinking my blu-ray player had somehow started playing the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford, hell then comes to minnie's! it quickly becomes evident we have been part of a tarrantino parlour game, a game of clue - cum - ten little indians, only in a wild west setting, and with blood, bones and bile in full effect. 

the whole thing is wonderfully stylish in the way that tarrantino is known for. the cartoonish horror mingles with more biting observations on humanity, the violence shocks to get a reaction from the viewer, for better or worse, and always there is humour, where hateful eight proves itself to be one damn funny film. 

morricone scores it as cartoon horror with western strains, and it's magnificent, it sounds like the evil twin to his score for the untouchables. the cast are super (though a couple of them are not given much to do), with leigh standing out, and messrs jackson and russell hold glorious excessive court. costuming is most appealing, as is the set-design for minnie's. and director qt? well he does his thing, chapters and verse and playful filmic cunning. 9/10",high

from start to finish, this film is filled with witty dialogue and dry humor that had me genuinely cracking up. the characters are all stereotypes on a comedic level, but when the writing is this good, they become much more than that. each character had some level of depth and uniqueness that gave this somewhat dry and slow plot a spark that continually kept the flame of the story burning.

samuel l. jackson is brilliant, this movie was directly written for him, and he makes use of every second of screen time he is given. his comedic delivery is excellent and towards the end of the movie his slyness and witty detective work are mesmerizing. kurt russell is hilariously stupid and his relationship with his captee (jennifer jason leigh) is hilarious, sweet, and sometimes demented. walton goggins was so damn funny here; this is my favorite performance by him. he makes this movie, and the ending resolution would not be the same without him. tim roth was awesome, and all the other gang members were great too. the only one that kind of stuck out was channing tatum. i do not know if it was my bias of his based on his previous work, but i did not buy him in this film. felt really out of place and unnecessarily cast on his name sack alone.

despite the slow pace and long runtime, this film is an utter masterpiece that keeps the viewer engaged and constantly curious about what the true motivations are behind each of our eight characters. the chapter-like structure is fantastic and there are some pulp fiction elements here in terms of storytelling order which i loved. while this may not be tarantino's best film, it is still an incredible product and another classic added to his filmography.

i'm definitely looking forward to seeing other films by this brazenly original writer/director. long may his almost-bunuelian take on things go forth.",high
4122,"> the truth determines our actions.

i found this film when it was listed in the bbc news' top 20 films of the 2015. this film topped the chart, then how can i just ignore which is my prime world news feed. the fun part was i saw a south korean film called 'assassination' believed to be this, but very i soon realised the mistake. anyhow, i loved the korean film that i reviewed a couple of moths ago on this same blog.

finally, i managed to see this mandarin film, but it was not anything like i've been expecting. critically acclaimed film, but commercially failed because of the slow narration. jointly produced by china-hong kong-taiwan, but selected as a taiwanese entry to the oscars that failed to make a progress to the main event.

not everybody can easily follow this narration. because this is not a typical historical film presentation with a clear introduction like in the background voice or in the texts, except in the opening that letting us know where and how it begins. the lack of the character development is the factor for all the complication. so i strongly suggest to read the synopsis before the watch and have a look at the film character infographic once finished watching.

the story sets in the 8th century china during the final years of the tang dynasty. when a well trained assassin failed to accomplish the mission directed by her master, she is sent to another province for another assignment where she starts to remember her past that she has some connection with her undertaking. with all the bad things happening in and around the royal family, state politics et cetera, the rift is inevitable that anytime the dynasty might fall. the remaining the tale reveals how the film ends with a realistic approach.

> ""the way of the sword is pitiless. saintly virtues play no part in it. your skills are matchless, but your mind is hostage to human sentiments.""

i am a film fanatic, so basically i love all the films i watch. but i prefer entertainment the most, followed by the message, education, inspiration, true events et cetera. i had seen many films like this that i mostly ended up unsatisfied. because a film without the background score as same as silent lullaby. speaking of music, when the film was in the final scene there came a music which i compare to oasis. that's the beautiful sound i have heard in this entire narration. slow camera panning and fixed cameras for minutes is what i disliked in it or any similar themed films.

i appreciate the effort to preserve the historical account in a film format, but the type of narration matters a lot if they expect the audiences backing. a film like this is specially made for film festivals, surely critics love it and as i heard they did. i can't believe even if the film critics failed to recognise what would be the film's fate.

so it is a slow film then, but when the stunt sequences appeared, i was thrilled with my full attention. well composed realistic fights, that's what anybody remembers when they think of chinese films. but i warn you this is not a complete martial art film except now and then you encounter such scenes. it is not even a horror, but there was a scene with smoke which scared the hell out of me. i was not expecting such thing, besides, i was bored to death when this thing came i woke up.

the film was shot in the beautiful outdoor places. apart from the stunts, i loved the landscapes which were just resembled the classical chinese paintings. i did not find any performances that impressive. i appreciate their effort, but since the story was told without anyone's particular perspective, felt like everyone had equal scope for their roles.

overall, i did not like the film and i'm not suggesting it to anybody. but if you are interested in the chinese ancient history or love the art films then you could try it. this is first low rated film to review on this blog which is i've been avoiding since the beginning, but decided to write for all kinds of rating now onwards.

the movie does cut away to planet earth and the spaceship returning home without him, so it isn’t all damon all the time. and some humor is injected here and there to offset the character’s grim situation. i liked the line where he referred to himself as the greatest biologist on the planet. as the only current resident on mars at that time, he was also the worst biologist on the planet!

another reason this film is remarkable is because there is a lot of science here, which drives the plot as he has to solve continuous problems that arise, not with brute strength or other physical,skills, but with his analytical mind. and yet the details don’t get tedious or overly  technical. oddly enough, it is not a movie i will watch multiple times, as i have lesser robust sci-fi entries such as super 8 or monsters, but i plan to watch it at least one more time, just out of appreciation for the solid job that was done in adapting what much must have been a very challenging story to film and have it be both entertaining and informative, both scientific and an  amazing adventure.",high

i think this flick is for adults. there's no sex, no nudity, not even a single kiss or the bad language and zero violence, its fine for teens and kids can understand, but the story is what i meant that suits only for the grown ups. like the usual, this spielberg movie is easy to follow, there's no tricky twists and turns, but aimed for only the event that's based on the real.

over a 2 hour long negotiation drama with surrounded by suspense and thrills. it's completely a one man show and the end has been just like everybody wanted. i'm not surprised that it is nominated for the oscars in the 6 categories including the best motion picture. i would be very happy if it puts at least a couple of trophies to its basket. i feel it is a must see if you're interested in wwii related subjects, other than the war.

too slow narration, and it is being a music genre, a little soulless. yeah, there's no rhythm. all we have seen a dj while performing, but what his life would be like is what this film was focused on. directional debute for a documentary filmmaker and he should make a couple of things right for his next film, including casting right actors and preparing an engaging screenplay. some people might like the film, but not for me. this is completely an ignorable film.

the lives of tony and elizabeth jordan are chronicled (t.c. stallings & priscilla c. shirer), a couple that seems to have it all: a healthy daughter, high-paying jobs and an awesome dream home. unfortunately, their marriage has become more of a war zone than a sanctuary and their daughter is collateral damage. after elizabeth meets miss clara on the job (karen abercrombie), she learns how to fight for her family instead of against them. her newly energized faith transforms her life and has a positive effect on those around her, but can it save her bad marriage?

an independent film, ""war room"" (2015) only cost $3 million to make and incredibly became the #1 movie in america upon release. is it worthy of such a feat?

with inspirational dramas like this i naturally ask myself if i was inspired, and the answer is very much so. also, did the drama pull me into the lives of the characters and make me forget that i was watching a movie? yes. the movie effectively addresses real life issues that real families have to deal with and overcome. i could relate to several of the situations.

the movie's similar in ways to 2010's underrated ""cutback"" (see my review), but made with a bigger budget and is therefore all-around more polished. ""war room"" is just a great drama and inspiring to boot. it overtly talks about god and prayer in a christian context, so if that offends you you'll probably want to give it a pass. it goes without saying that topics like this are difficult to pull off realistically and un-awkwardly in cinema, but ""war room"" impressively pulls it off.

(thankfully this ended when i was talking with my friend, who was carrying home his personal baseball equipment, when i was approached. i asked if i could borrow his bat for a second, and that ended that. i wouldn't recommend that as a solution to others, for legal reasons. thankfully the bully's mom and mine were friends, and when he ran home crying and told her what happened, she replied, 'if billy did that to you, then you deserved it.')

i don't often do so, but i watched the dvd extras before i watched the film (i usually wait until afterwards). edgerton's impressive directorial debut here, as well as script, fulfilled (at least to my eyes) his purpose, that of making a psychological thriller along the level of his directing idols, sir alfred hitchcock and david fincher. the three main stars, edgerton, jason bateman and rebecca hall (i kept thinking she was anne hathaway!), did very good work here. i never really went for bateman's work when he was younger, but a good friend often watched 'arrested development' when i was over, a few years back, and i have grown to like his acting, but he really hits it out of the park here. had this not been an independent production but a more big-budget affair (i.e., david fincher), i think he could have gotten an oscar nomination--he's that good here.

there was the occasional logical issue i had with the film afterwards, when i stopped and really thought hard about it, but i have no problem with that kind of thing, if i enjoy everything else (which i did). highly recommended. definitely worth buying and rewatching--and i can't say that about most films made today. i hope that edgerton doesn't give up acting, because he's definitely good at it, but i hope he also keeps on writing scripts and directing. simply based on 'the gift', he has an admirer in me for life.",high

the second movie for me from this director after a beautiful child custody dramedy, 'everybody in our family'. this was totally different, a historical theme that takes place 200 years early to the present. this is a black and white flick that perfectly blends with the timeline of the narration. the romania's submission for the 2016's oscars. i have not seen all the foreign movie nominees, but having seen the out of the contest films like this and brasil's 'the second mother', they are a lot better than the actually in the race film, 'a war'.

coming to this movie, i was almost certain that i wasn't going to write a review after knowing about it through the trailer and the synopsis despite good ratings and praised by the critics. because i felt this must be a boring kind, so was thinking to get over with it. like there's a saying, don't judge a book by its cover, it happened right here for me with this movie. so this is where i realised after the watch that the academy awards was totally wrong for snubbing it. in fact, this was one of the best foreign movies i have seen in the last six months or so.

> ""when a wise man opens his mouth, open your ear.""

they might have had a solid reason for that, that i don't know, but my guess is the film's ending. the opening was slow, the dialogues were loud, but sometime foolishly funny and sometimes wisely funny. overall you must pay close attention, so that you can enjoy jokes. definitely a wonderful adventure, like any other man hunt films, this was so serious on that affair, but viewers won't realise that till the final scene. a well supported music throughout to tell an incredible tale about two men on the mission who meet different people, land, culture and language.

it is 1835, in the eastern europe region, wallachia, the father-son duo from the police force on a trail to track down a runaway slave. they must go beyond their territorial limits to find him. on their way, they came forwards to the people they just met needed help, and vice versa, after the intense search they grab him in the remote place, but his version of the story to flee differs. so what comes later is the final act and a very shocking conclusion.

not so interested to very into it is something that i was not expected. the reason was obvious it was funnier than i thought. besides that, i was uncomfortable with the slavery theme. it's turning me off from having a good time and beginning to concern. but that's how the old world was, as it was based on the old documents and texts of the real event. after that horrifying finale, the bold statement from the father to son that goes like this 'god, even looks after worms and we can't look after each other' is what made me think we had come a long way since, yet do everything has changed now? and you know the answer to that.

it was not an unusual storyline, i have seen hundreds of other similar films, but it was from the different country, hence different language, culture, comedies, landscapes and different outcome result. well, this film gets you at with the different moods at the different level of the narration. a fine merges of multiple genre, and yet delivers more than you anticipating. if you are wondering what is the meaning of the title, 'well done' or 'bravo' is the english translation.

low budget movie? but, that's the reason this movie makes a very interesting. because the 19th century tale and this film that kind feels like made in the early 30s (except the high framerate) pretty unlike to any modern black and white films. definitely a must see if you're interested in this year's oscar nominees for the best foreign movies, even though it did not make.

it's not usual to see a mexican film being highlighted in portugal, and even less being entirely dubbed into our language. however, i have just seen it on tv, on a sunday morning, the regular time at which children's animated films are usually shown. and after researching a little about it, i was truly surprised by the number of films about roosters and eggs that mexican animation cinema has already made.

overall, i liked what i saw. it's not an original film, we've already seen a lot of similar things, but it was a consistent, solid effort and denotes some ambition and also technical and artistic capacity, which is commendable for a country that makes a lot of cinema for regional consumption, but has some difficulty in export films to the old continent. it's not a movie that makes me laugh a lot, and i bet most kids will enjoy it, but without feeling excited about what they're seeing and quickly forgetting everything they've seen.

the script revolves around toto, a young chicken who has to save his family's farm, preventing it from being taken over by a malicious landowner. to do so, he needs to defeat a big fighting cock in a stakes fight. of course, the other animals, chickens and talking eggs will try their best to help you tip the odds in your favour. therefore, it is a retelling of the old story of david against goliath, of the struggle of the oppressed and weak against the powerful. it's effective, has a good, uplifting moral message, and entertains the audience well.

on a technical level, the film deserves attention for its impeccable graphics and visuals. the cgi used in the animations is not exactly state of the art, it is not pristine and ultra-realistic. none of that. however, it's elegant enough, pretty enough, doesn't make gross mistakes, and has very good color and stroke. the mood isn't perfect, but it seems okay, it's within what i expected to find. i cannot evaluate the original dialogues and jokes since i saw the dubbed version for my language and not the original, but i am satisfied with the dub done by the portuguese, it is a job that seems to be well done.",low

one of the proofs that indian films are getting better every year. very soon it will be placed next to the hollywood, ahead of european, japanese, korean for sure when it comes to international revenue. because there's fierce competition between bollywood, kollywood, tollywood, mollywood and many more. not only among the filmmakers, but fanbase/followers as well.

it is happening because of the younger generation. while they are experimenting and propelling to the future, the senior filmmakers and artists are wasting their reputation for mindless commercial films which is only moving backwards. it's time for non-indians to learn about other than bollywood and i also hate when people call all the indian movies bollywood.

> when the time is not matter, everything is possible.

while 'endhiran' making its debut, they said it will ignite the sci-fi era in indian cinema. half a decade has passed and of course, some films came, but this is the major time travel movie i have ever seen in the tamil language. though, it was a b category movie. because the cast has no major star values other than in the local market and it was directed by an incoming filmmaker. i think it was well written screenplay, it was not an intelligent, but easily understandable by everyone. i mean even by the older and rural people.

time travel is not new in indian films, but very very least explored theme. it did not waste time to explain the rules and mechanism from the basics, i think because of familiarity with hollywood flicks among indian audience. but still keeps a very simple story and due to layers in time (not the story), looks a little muddle. not easy to predict, but feels like missed by a very close to fingertip.

all in his movie, vishnu has done a wonderful job, but only a couple of films were somewhat widely  recognised. mainly because of the low cost movies and failed to promote, in another way to say, filmfestivel movies. yet another similar outcome from this one which should have helped him to rise, but did not. he is a best all-rounder in the ccl's rhino, hope his day will come as an actor well.

> ""telling a girl and posting on facebook is the same.""

the other actor, karunakaran was also excellent. he was the comedian and the sidekick before this film, but in here he one of the two leads. like i always say, the songs are the drawback in indian films and in this film they did not completely discarded, but reduced the numbers by around 50 per cent. the good thing is, all the songs were with the story, not some unnecessary drag to the outside of the topic.

fantastic visuals, the standards were pared with any major english movies. but the graphics are what, only the time machine and the rest were story with human characters. the first hour was so fun and romantic, and the remaining hour was a thriller that keeps picking the pace till the final battle. overall a two hour movie, definitely short and sweet as an indian film.

i liked everything in the movie, from an attempt to make this experimental movie for the first time to production quality and performances. but, other than the songs, without the romance track in the narration, still feels impossible to survive its own as a perfect sci-fi-thriller. excluding a few minor flaws from the movie, this is a very good film considering a low-budget tamil movie.

i have heard (might be rumours) there's a possible for a sequel and this time the guest actor, arya will be making his presence in a full fledged role. it must happen, because it was a brilliant narrative that can go up to become a trilogy. especially his star value would make the franchise reach every corner. for those who want to see it, i remind don't anticipate like of hollywood, british films. for indian standards, it was a much better than nonsense masala films. highly recommended, if you have not tasted kollywood yet, it might be a better one to begin with.

this is the very closest movie to my favourite thai teen rom-com 'a little thing called love'. in fact a few scenes are almost resembling, including the main characters and love quadrilateral. so there's no wrong if i call it the taiwan version of that movie. i thought i am going through again in another language, but i was not uninterested to sit for it because it was a beautiful story that i can re-watch numerous times without losing any interest.

remember its not the same movie, but only a similar themed flick, or maybe a highly inspired by that. this film had its own share of story and character developments. the third act was obviously a bit stretched, but twist came at early in that section and turned this tale into entirely different from what we thought going to happen. except the second conclusion (i mean the real time ending, not the flashback's) which was so old fashioned.

i found some similarities with my life and that thai movie i mentioned, because that was based on the true story of everyone's first love and so this one. so finding a slice of your life in it is very much possible. the story of an ordinary girl, but it opens with a young woman recalls her school days after discovering her successful life was seen differently by others from her back. that takes us to the early 90s, like every girl in the school how her crush on a most handsome boy on the campus changes the course of her romance life after receiving a prank letter that states she must forward it to others.

obviously it is a girl movie from a teenage girl's perspective narration. but as a movie fanatic, i never had any issues with such kind of movies or any others and to like them openly. basically, i watch any movies because i want to be an all-rounder, not to stick to my age or what i'm. this movie simply reminds my school days and would do same to you as well. the school culture is different from european and north american to the rest of the world, especially in asia. but if you're from south, southeast or east asian, you will get familiar feeling with this film and that will helps you to like the movie a lot.

in a few parts it lost its reality touch to, you know things that happen only in movies, especially as i said the ending and scenes that tried hard to bring laughs. you love this only for the flashback narration. the first and the last 5 minutes were ordinary. everyone's performance was phenomenal, totally engaging storytelling. in this particular movie it was not about how much predictable, even if you feel deja-vu, but how it pleases you with those quirky atmosphere. a youthful taiwanese film i liked very much since 'you are the apple of my eye'. it does not look like it was made by an incoming director.

there were plenty of fun, but on the emotional side, it was slightly weak. but overall it was one of the best coming-of-age movie of all time and recently i have seen. it's already gained a cult status from youngsters that you can find fan made arts across the web. don't give up on this if you are an adult or adult male, entertainment should be the preference and what comes beyond that is not your choice, but the natural response from your inside. despite the length of the movie, it had an energetic pace with fine music and heartwarming scenes. in general, i recommend it to all, especially if you like teen romance.

another sensational movie from dhanush k. raja, the producer of 'the crow's egg' that i recently reviewed in this site. this time he joined the hands with the writer, director who bought him a best actor award at the indian academy award for the movie 'playground'. the film was based on the novel 'lock up' that loosely inspired by the experiences of the author who is an autorickshaw driver now.

i already mentioned that indian cinema is waking up, knocking the doors of the international film critics, films festivals and film buffs. thanks to the young generation in the film industry, looking for the international market expansion. it's time for you to check it out some of the indian parallel cinemas, not the masala films. if you think you're totally in an unfamiliar territory, then it will be good to you start with this one.

india is like the european union, where each nation speaks a different language and its own culture, likewise each indian state has a different language and culture. that's why it might be called the indian subcontinent. this story begins when three tamil labourers who are illegally living in a city park to save rent money from the work in the neighbor state andhra, will be taken to the police custody without letting know them the reason. the rest of the film exposes the law enforcement agency's brutality on these young innocent men to force to accept a crime that is not committed by them which is a violation of human rights.

> ""the influence is more important than skill when it comes to promotions.""

the film has two phases and they were not focused on any particular characters. it is a couple of different events based flick that connected to each other by the characters. but everything is about corruption in the police force and common people who affected by that. kind of unpredictable scenes with the decent twists. the first half takes place in andhra pradesh with the backdrop of some robbery case and then in the next half it moves to tamil nadu with once again a cop tale, but different scenario.

welcome to the indian police's torture chamber. the dark side of the indian police force. not all about the bad cops, but also involves those honest ones caught between dishonest ones from the higher power. there was a small romance plot in the opening, later it vanished when entire story focus shifted to police interrogation. the pace had many up and down, that helped to turn things around like transforming from one state of condition to another.

this theme was exactly opposite to the old saying 'lightning never strikes the same place twice'. you can call it a bad luck, but for some people like the youngsters from this movie who came from the poor families from the rural without proper education, it is a matter of life and death and injustice. i won't be surprised if international remake are made. it won this year's indian academy awards in the three categories including the supporting actor which was one of the important cop roles.

this is a kollywood film, but watching it feels like a some dark tone korean crime-drama-thriller. i have seen some of indian cop films, but so far this one was the best when it comes to the realism yet not depicted them in a good way. i highly recommend it, but don't expect a genuine screenplay with a grand twist. it makes you feel how the innocence was taken away from the poor by the people with power, really heartbreaking.

surely my review would annoy those who liked it. but the majority of who saw it was felt just like me. it has been 20 years since the first 3d animated feature film came. not all the films released in this period were great. some were technically sounded good and some were stories. if you had seen 'hoodwinked!', you would know how awesome that story was, despite the poor animation production. but this film failed in all the department.

i recently finished watching the first season of 'trollhunters' and 'miraculous ladybug'. even the television made products were much better than this film. small budget, small production house et cetera is not an excuse. thankfully, this is not the only bad animated feature i've seen so far in my life, but sadly it joins the list of those titles.

maybe! the little kids could enjoy it, who does not know to differentiate between good and bad. but for the adults, this is definitely skippable film. the best thing about this film was the message it carried, though, even for an animated film and a fantasy film, not convincing enough. it was kind of very similar to 'delhi safari'. in some perspective, i thought it was a remake of that. there are lots of other films similar to this like 'chole & theo', 'happy feet' and so on that you can try them instead.

there is a lot of cgi in the movie and although quite a few reviewers seem to consider it bad i personally though it was pretty okay. one of the few decent bits of the movie.

i truly do not understand that they had the nerve to call this movie the legend of tarzan since it really is pretty far from the legend of tarzan that edgar rice burroughs created. this movie would perhaps have been okay as a one hour episode in a tarzan tv-show but as a high budget feature movie it simply does not cut it. i was quite disappointed.",low

<em>'free state of jones'</em> tells the true story of newton knight's role in the american civil war. as you'd hope/expect, it leads to captivating viewing. matthew mcconaughey is superb, while he's supported excellently by mahershala ali.

it's tough to watch in large portions given the obvious things from the civil war era, from the war itself but also to slavery. i had never heard of newton knight, so it was very interesting for me to see it unfold and learning bits - even with some creative license, i'm sure. it also serves an important message that slavery didn't end with the emancipation proclamation.

i personally found the film very well paced and extremely nicely shot, mcconaughey and ali are the stars but there are also notable performances from the likes of gugu mbatha-raw. it's a great film, one that's worth a watch. sadness and heart aplenty.",high

10 cloverfield lane is directed by dan trachtenberg and collectively written by josh campbell, matthew stuecken and damien chazelle. it stars john goodman, mary elizabeth winstead and john gallagher jr. music is by bear mccreary and cinematography by jeff cutter.

michelle (winstead) awakes from a car crash to find she is in a locked underground shelter...

from the off it has to be said that to know nothing about this film prior to viewing it will be an absolute bonus. for the rewards are plenty. trachtenberg and his team have crafted a film that is tense from the get go, a piece that consistently has you wondering just what the hell is going on, not only are we puzzled by the three character dynamic in the shelter, particularly as regards howard (goodman), the proprietor of this particular shelter, but also just what has happened in the outside world? if anything? this only helps further the claustrophobic feel that's already brought about by the location setting of the tale.

a key strength of it, is that it, via michelle's mindset, coerces us viewers into feeling her unease, and yet conversely we rejoice at her resourcefulness. on the same side of the coin comes her relationship with the third party in the shelter, emmett (gallagher jr), it grows honestly and offers hope in what looks to be a bleak situation. but of course as tale unfolds, things start to come together, edgily so, with little spurts of action, shocks and genuine dread, all building up to the big finale, the reveals. which will either have you spitting feathers or cursing the makers for the routes taken...

superbly acted by the three principals (it's great that some film makers still realise goodman is a major talent), and technically impressive for sound and vision, this coiled spring thriller is a winner. 8.5/10",high
4240,"it is actually quite some time since i watched doctor strange but somehow the movie must have slipped between the cracks since i appear to have forgotten to review it. so i am about to remedy that now. to put it in simple terms: this is an excellent movie. it is a wonderful display of magical fireworks with a decent enough story to keep it together.

i have to confess that i have not really read many of the comics containing doctor strange so it is a bit difficult for me to comment on the aspect of the film versus the comics. from the little that i have read i got the impression that the comic book version of doctor strange was a wee bit more dark, serious and mature. this movie starts from the beginning of his career though so i guess there is some justification for the less mature doctor strange in the movie.

doctor strange is a skilled neurosurgeon but a bit of an asshole. actually more than “a bit”. he gets involved in a accident, that he pretty much causes himself due to his arrogance. fast forward to the interesting chapter were we get to see doctor strange being, reluctantly, admitted into a scruffy looking monastery on the other side of the planet. that is when the fun starts. doctor strange is in for a ride. slowly doctor strange gets knocked into him that magic exists and he is expected to practice it.

the time at the monastery, or perhaps we should call it a school, leads to a few funny episodes and i do like the head monk’s bantering with strange and the way she does things. talk about getting thrown into the deep end of the swimmingpool first. strange’s continued arrogance and immaturity is a bit annoying from time to time though. that has to be said.

what is the use of super heroes if there are no bad guys around. so after strange having trained for a while, and mostly failed miserably, the bad guys starts to crash the party. so no more pretty living room magic for strange. it is time to go head to head with some serious competition. unfortunately, for a good chunk of the first fights strange mostly falls on his arse. they are still cool and beautiful to watch though.

slowly strange starts to get to grip with this whole magic thing and he also starts to shed some of that arrogance of his and take some responsibility. about time since the despicable bad guy are, of course, working towards freeing the real big bad guy, father of all evil and mother of everything else bad you can think of. time for a showdown.

as the fighting escalates so does the user of special effects and personally i though the special effects were both beautiful and spectacular. i really liked them.

i am not sure cumberbatch would have been my first choice for doctor strange though. to me he do not really project the image of the wise and skilled wizard i expected. he is not bad though. the only other person that stood out for me was the chief monk and the ancient one which i also quite liked. the rest of the characters, well to me they mostly lived in the shadows of these two, even though they were in general likable and sometimes fun.

there were a few rather hilarious parts where strange has to reveal the truth about what he stepped in to his former girlfriend. i have a soft spot for the surprise moments in both movies and books.

i rather not get started on time travel since i generally hate it as a story element since it almost always leads to paradoxes or is simply so poorly done that it is blatantly obvious that someone tried to cover up for a lazy and shoddy story. however i guess i have to mention that screwing around with time is an important part of the plot in this movie. luckily it is done in such a way that it do not, in my opinion, negatively impact the movie. actually, to my surprise, it is used in a rather cool way.

some reviews giving this movie 9 or 10 stars (which is just ludicrous) are saying that people cannot handle the feminism in the movie. what feminism? replacing the original actors with women is not feminism as far as i am concerned and anyway, if you care about such things should it not have been two women and two men to be politically correct? also, the supposedly intelligent women in this movie behave in a typical old-fashioned hollywood stereotype of women way. they are mostly downright silly. if i were a feminist i would actually have been insulted by this movie.

then we have the male clerk that is dummer than a piece of rock. if someone had stacked four supposedly intelligent men and a single blond bimbo that is totally devoid of any trace of intelligence together in a movie the social justice warriors would have cried foul so loud that you could hear it across the planet. but since it is four women and a stupid male it is okay (not really). it is even feminism according to some people. what a load of bollocks.

there is actually a story in the movie although it is well hidden under the silly jokes and silly behavior. it is paper thin and rather silly in itself but it could have worked if the rest of the movie was up to snuff but sadly it is not.

as i wrote above the only good thing about this movie is the special effects. the few scenes that i actually enjoyed was during the big shoot out at the end which had some cool moments. i especially liked when jillian pulls a pair of pistols out of her ghostbuster suit and goes on a ghost killing spray.

i have to agree with the film critics on this one. felt like i have already seen this film, but it turned out to be a very familiar thriller theme. it had plenty of issues and the first thing was the main plot in which the story built on. the mother-child connection is a very sensitive matter and that's where the film got stumbled. even though they wanted to do film on that, they did not convince with the portrayed of the surrogate mother. from the entertainment perspective, it lacked the thriller big. the climax was all the sudden and then it ended just like that.

at first i thought it might be a remake, but it was inspired or borrowed the theme from elsewhere. this psychological-thriller focused on to tell the tale of a wealthy childless couple. they decide to hire a young and beautiful anna to be their surrogate mother. when everything was going very well, anna's crush on the man she's carrying a baby begin to blow the things off. so now what happens to the couple, anna and the baby revealed in the final segment.

thankfully, this is not the worst film of the year. i have even worse than this. but this can be easily a skippable one. there's no complaint over the actors, they had given what the characters demanded. rich in quality, not a bad film from the technical aspect. those are the area where it got scored a few points from me. if the screenplay had developed well, the film would have been in a different league. particularly, i did not like the lack of diversity, looked like a black film for the black viewers. there are lots of similar films which are much better than this one that you could try.

everything i wrote was just my personal opinion, definitely not intended to offend anybody. ben stiller is a good actor, but a fine filmmaker, his directional ventures were awesome, especially after his last film 'walter mitty' the expectation was very high on this, but i did not think it'll end like this. it hits the rock bottom, the lowest point in his directional career. his odd film experiment had failed, just for one project and i know he will come back strong. but as an actor, he still got the star value and i'm looking forward for his upcoming project.

it has been 15 years since the original film and i don't remember much of it. but before this, i had a very quick re-view, so i'm to get a clean flow for a better understanding. anyway, the film gave a brief report about the past events in the beginning, but when i saw the first face in the opening scene i knew it will going to suck and it did.

okay, the first, the story was decent, but not the jokes. and the next, there are too many cameos that kind of ruined its pace to keep quiet for sometime and to focus on actual story development. from all those, the best part and where i actually had a brief laugh was to see neil degrasse tyson. the second films are always very crucial, because it is a bridge between the original film and numerous follow-ups to set up a franchise status. so clearly this film stumbled and i don't think there will be any more films in this series.

the original 'zoolander' had its own brand appeal, but with this bad film it got lost. the production was very good and so the performances, but the humours were average. no offense, there are some people who still liked it, but i did not, so i won't recommend it for the 'zoolander' fans as well as if you're looking for a good comedy. but like i always say who knows you might like it, so think twice in which one is if you're reading this review and the second is analyse it before to decide anything.

this sequel was savaged by critics, and sadly i have to concur with that judgment. the film's problems are legion. for one, this is one of those sequels that thinks that any gag that was funny in the first film has to be repeated almost verbatim here. but this time, those gags just fall flat. the zoolander story is too aware of itself as a phenomenon to have the underdog charm and quirky originality of the original 2001 film. the pacing is badly thought out; the unfunny exposition takes so long that the real meat of this comedy has to be compressed into so few minutes that ultimately, it's over almost as soon as it started. and then there are the utterly pointless cameos: katy perry and neil degrasse tyson are brought onscreen with absolutely no relevance to the events that are transpiring, and audiences are just supposed to laugh at seeing them? bizarre.

there are some nice parts here. i think kyle mooney is one of the most interesting and versatile comedians working at the moment, and his part here as a tiresomely ironic hipster (""you guys suck, i love you!"") had some laugh out loud moments. to play mugatu, will ferrel again gives an over-the-top performance that you could tell he had put a lot of thought and effort into, and it's so sad that his part was essentially relegated to a minor one in the end. but as i laughed at the good bits here, i kept wishing they could somehow be extracted from this film and placed instead into a much better one. overall, this is probably worth avoiding even if you enjoyed the the 2001 film.",low

at this age, robert de niro was unbelievably awesome, though his character needed a good support from another and that's where as usual zac failed to deliver his part. i would have preferred someone like taylor lautner who's desperate for a breakthrough than the zac who ruins always.

the screenplay was from the 'blacklist', knowing this they should have been more careful while casting for it. the story was okay, because it was not meant for one of the greatest films of all time. it was sort of a weekend getaway or the bachelor party theme, but the film gives its original reason and then those developed plots were too familiar if you have seen plenty of teen films, in the party theme.

it's supposed to make us laugh, but there are lots of outdated humours tried in the unusual route to narrate them. the grandfather-grandson combo was an excellent idea, the main plot revolves around them and it should have remained that way, but the undetermined romance was an interruption. or they should have developed a decent romance track for a better balance in the genre.

at least it would have been all right if it was a teen film. many of those who appeared in it were actually too old to represent the roles given to them. that's fine too, because films are fake, everything is make-up and performance, but none were at their best except de niro and aubrey plaza. it is definitely a film to skip, that's my opinion, but they're a few who are defending it, so be careful that i'm not always right and they're not always wrong if you want to choose it.

usually horror films are the most clichéd genre, especially when it comes to those scaring parts, all the films use the same sudden sound effects and disfigured human images with the strong makeup or the graphics. this film is nothing less than any of those, but a bit too much in the first three quarters. like they are keeping some suspense, but it was just dragging to extend the film length and what comes in the final quarter is actually the story with a twist. so when that revelation happens, you would probably lose complete interest on this. because that's not the demons you're expecting after all the hype was created in the earlier segment.

the story was just okay, but it was well known to us in different forms from the different films. in this, it is set in a different location with different cast, so that makes the film is fresh, but it wasn't. some ancient spirits were set loose when a family was picnicking and it follows them to their house. now they suffer from some unexplainable events and they decide to get rid bringing the people who can. that leads to the final act where the story comes to end.

they say it was inspired by the real event involving a family. so that might interest some viewers to check it out. but if you're an atheist, this is just a joke. from the director of 'wolf creek' with the decent performances by kevin bacon and radha mictchell, the film did not become best among its theme. just a watchable film, after that you won't going to remember it a week or a month later. very few might like it, but it's impossible to say who they're, so i'm not going to suggest or reject it.

4354,"a screen zealots review www.screenzealots.com

louisa says:

what…did i….just watch?

not for the uninitiated or those with weak stomachs, everyone’s favorite polarizing surrealist director nicolas winding refn is back with the lurid, gory, sadistic, and horrifyingly beautiful “the neon demon.” this film makes a bold statement about the shallowness of hollywood and the fashion industry in the most violent, brutal, bloody and disturbing way possible.

the film’s strength is in its breathtaking visuals. refn once again establishes himself as a true auteur at the top of the visionary food chain. even if you are one of the many who see him as pompous and pretentious, there’s no denying that few have quite the mastery of the craft of the visual arts as he does. this film belongs in a modern art museum.

it doesn’t matter that there’s not much of a plot: teenage ingénue jesse (elle fanning) moves to los angeles to chase her dreams of becoming a model. she soon finds herself living in a sketchy motel with lecherous landlord hank (keanu reeves) and surrounded by the seductive ruby (jena malone), gigi (bella heathcote) and sarah (abbey lee), a pack of shallow, jealous, beauty-obsessed women. it’s hard to evaluate the performances since most consist of nothing more than striking and holding a pose or staring longingly into a mirror, but i do think that reeves has one of the greatest (if small) roles of his career.

there’s no escaping the true debate this movie presents: is this a shrewd feminist manifesto or is it grossly misogynistic? it’s taken me three days to reflect on this and i’ve decided that it sways towards the former rather than the latter.

first, the film celebrates the female form; the women in the film are beautiful set dressings, designed to be admired (and not treated solely as sexual objects). yes, the women are one-dimensional but at the same time, that works as a harsh criticism of the narcissism that’s so prevalent in the fashion industry. refn also artfully expresses the malice that is sometimes deeply hidden in the female psyche. the film is insightful too: women have a dark side and sometimes we do feel like we are in a girl-eat-girl world (a phrase that the film takes a bit too literally).

refn’s hypnotic signature is all over this stylish, elegantly violent film. cinematographer natasha braier adds a disturbing hallucinatory effect while cliff martinez lends a thumping, ear-splitting, ominous score that reflects the overall atmosphere of insanity.

as with the director’s other films (“drive,” “only god forgives“), there are plenty of scenarios that seem to be present with the sole intent to shock, offend or disgust. (do we really need an extended scene of lesbian necrophilia? i guess you can argue the point, but the scene goes on a bit too long to make it seem relevant to the plot or characters). the extreme last act feels more like a pointless gross-out than a thoughtful commentary think piece. i think this is a good place to mention that this film is a very, very hard ‘r’ rating; i am surprised it’s not nc-17.

“the neon demon” isn’t your run-of-the-mill art house film; it’s so far beyond the art house that it’s in another dimension.

matt says:

a teenage runaway from sandusky, ohio steps off a bus into the glittering lights of hollywood. all of her friends back home tell her that she’s destined to be a star, and she believes them. but hollywood does not bestow fame and fortune without a price. first it will take her innocence, then it will take all that remains.

so is the story of “the neon demon,” the new film by auteur nicolas winding refn (“drive,” “only god forgives”). elle fanning is jesse, the underage runaway that has been lured to los angeles by the whispered promises of becoming a famous model. she meets up with another innocent who was been lured to the city: photographer dean (karl glusman), whose attempts at emulating the art he sees in hollywood through pictures are met with sneering ridicule as “amateurish.” dean hasn’t sold his soul, and those who have have nothing but contempt for him.

jesse, on the other hand, makes the bargain readily: after being paraded before harshly appraising eyes and being judged a piece of meat worthy of notice, she willingly trades her virtue for empty glamour and attention. after having reborn on the runway, jesse quickly learns that she has still not given enough: people continue to want more from her, and what they want she isn’t willing to give.

“the neon demon” is not for everyone. it’s not even for most. even if you enjoyed “drive,” you may find yourself frustrated and your patience tried by this movie. there is much to appreciate, but you will be challenged in doing so. in this film, winding refn has made an art piece that must be assessed, considered, and deconstructed. those who are literal-minded will likely find their patience tried: the story isn’t about what’s happening on the surface, it’s about what’s happening underneath. you must watch, listen, and observe carefully.

one additional word of warning: “the neon demon” is highly disturbing and will upset many casual viewers. apart from its gore and physical violence, the film pushes boundaries hard. terrible things are either shown or implied. i can’t for the life of me understand why the studio and theater chains thought that this was an appropriate film to release in nearly 800 theaters nationwide. one can imagine that of the few audience members who didn’t walk out during the first 20 minutes ran for the exits at its offscreen implication of child abuse.

if you’re still reading this review and haven’t been dissuaded yet, i recommend that you see this movie. it’s one of the most interesting discussion pieces in recent memory and it’s not one that i will soon forget.

4356,"**it's not anymore a competitive world, but jealousy!**

it started off very well and in the half mark, it completely lost. in the initial part, it looked like a normal film and then i think even the writer does not know what could happen, they just improvised with whatever they had. writing was totally messed up. when they had the great characters, it becomes nothing in the end. i'm not a fan of this director, and all his films are average, but this one is the worst among them.

i'm not an art film hater, though i hate wasting scenes without any developments and this one had many like them. if you trim them all out, the overall film is around 45 minutes. the rest of the film was just music, colourful lights, and sometimes totally idle, which definitely drag the viewers to the boredom.

whenever there was a scene with the story, like dialogues and developments, i thought it was going well. but then those useless, dialogueless segments turned me off. especially the conclusion was absolutely crap. elle was good, like a character made for her. keanu reeve was useless, his addition was just a marketing strategy that did not click.

this is the story of a teen girl aspiring to be a model, but surrounded by the jealousy people because of her fast growth. how it all goes between them and in the fashion world is what the film talks. the film is watchable, but mostly the second half onwards it gets boring. in the end, i don't think anyone would be satisfied completely with their watch, maybe very, very few, but if you consider the majority, this does not deserve to be suggested.

4368,"this is a movie that made me soooo happy that i decided to jump and fork out some money (way too much actually, i’m on a bread and water diet now) for a nice oled screen. this movie is a stunning visual adventure.

the two main characters are described as mercenary warriors but the terms thieves and rascals are probably better suited. they do know how to fight though and they get plenty of opportunity to prove it in the menu.

this is another one of those movies that live and die by the visuals. the plot is a basic enough adventure story with some additional twists, like mysterious meteorites and really really nasty monsters, thrown in. it is not bad but not exactly groundbreaking either. the same with the characters. they are perhaps not exactly flat but not really fantastic either. what makes the movie great is the action and the visuals. the story and the characters are just there to prop the visuals up and they are doing a perfectly adequate job of it.

the movie starts off in a rather dry and deserted landscape. the first scenes are actually rather dark and somewhat blurry. luckily we rather quickly arrive at the great wall and the colors explode onto the screen. the chinese army in their shining colored armor is really visually impressive.

it does not take very long for the action to start and apart from the usual arrow flinging, acrobatic stabbing and slashing the chinese army starts to deploy their various contraptions for fighting the oncoming swarm of nasty creatures. i found all the things that they had cooked up quite fascinating and contributing nicely to the visuals and the fun.

for example, bungee jumping into a hord of jumping and snapping monsters wanting to take a (huge) bit of you armed with a spear. is that cool or what? heck, i want to do that. well, without the monsters of course … and the bungee part. okay, i confess, i was just watching the girls. did i mention that all the bungee jumpers where hot chicks? and if any of you go all feminist and gender crap on me for those remarks you can shove it somewhere. if you think the bungee jumping stuff sounds like i was watching a silly comedy then trust me, it makes sense … kind of … in the context of this movie at least.

then there are rotating knifes sticking out of slits in the wall, fireball throwing catapults, various applications of gunpowder (that was after all why the two scoundrels where there in the first place) etc. etc. all accompanied by various acrobatics by the different combattants. each scene was both cool action and a great symphony of elegance and colors.

the one part of the movie that i thought was a bit of a letdown was the parts where the emperor of china appeared. why portray him as an arrogant, lazy thundering idiot? it is really not funny. the chain of events that he caused could really had been started in a more intelligent way without going down that overused and boring route.

the movie works itself forward to a nice final, desperate, fight to defeat the monster queen and her hord of baddies. it is a nice fight, as visually stunning as the rest of the movie, filled with lots of stunts of all kinds. the huge hords of beasts climbing, jumping and moving in big patterns on command from the queen was really cool.

for me this was one hour and forty minutes of much enjoyment.",high
4369,"**decent visuals, but has no fresh vision.**

i always thought what they call the great wall of china is the symbol of the chinese scary-ism against the mighty mongolians in the ancient time. so when i first saw this trailer, i shocked and then i said: what the heck. you can't just hide the truth and recreate whatever new thing you want. but that's how the china and chinese evolved for thousands of years. like it could be martial arts, rice, noodles or the dragon, all of them came from outside. then when i saw the film, the first scene itself cleared my doubt. it states the film was based on the legend. i thought it was a good start after the misleading promos.

so this is china's effort to make a product at home par with hollywood. they had hired top technicians from the west, that's including matt damon. with this kind of attempt, they should have triumphed. yeah, the graphics were good and then if you check it out the end credits, it was actually not a pure chinese made product as what we see on the screen, which was 99 per cent chinese cast. 'kung fu yoga' is a fine example, what the made in china looks like.

the director is known for traditional films, like mixing art, martial arts and culture, particularly the middle age. i like his films of the 00s, but this one was utterly commercial crap. when it comes to the ideas for the scenes, every segment and every frame reminded me some hollywood's greatest graphic film from the recent decade. particularly the monsters as the zombies from 'world war z' and the chinese soldiers totally replicates the elves of woodland realm. that proves, the chinese are masters of copying/duplicating. it has a decent visual, but not fresh vision. they should have handed it over entirely, except producing it for the better outcome.

it is the early 11th century, at one of the sections of northern china wall, where a couple of white men caught by the chinese army after they were chased by a group of bandits. they have come with an agenda, but there's something big is going on. first, they have to win the chinese trust and so they succeed on that, but things changes as the weather of the place has changed. besides, they have no choice than to cooperate with them, but then the differences divide the two men. who takes what path and their fates are decided at the film's climax.

> ❝they have trained all their lives for this war.❞

many western actors, filmmakers had tried their luck in chinese filmdom, but not all were succeeded. tapping chinese market is not that simple. there are too many complications like restriction in thematic and using content in the story. if that complies, then they must use chinese cast and crew for some percentage. from all, the greatest surprise was, like jimmy kimmel said, why would damon had given up the oscar award winning role from his own production for this cheap flick from the east.

i always appreciate the good films, no matter where it had come from. it all depends on the quality and the contents, but sometimes there is exemption if the production was under a limited, small cost. there's no such excuse for this film. besides my issue was not the graphics, except borrowing the ideas from others, but it was the poor screenplay. you can clearly say that i'm not happy with this one. this is just another film that looks like a computer game as similar to the 'resident evil' film series.

the west had given up on digital 3d, but china has a special obsession with that, and so am i. that is the reason those failed films, bet against the dollars, which were strongly influenced by that technology, such as 'age of extinction', 'warcraft' et cetera survived by earning yuan. like i mentioned, the director is not this kind of cheap filmmaker. but it clearly understandable that he wanted to give what the domestic audience wanted, a good digital 3d film. for that, it has to be full scale action-adventure, not filled with drama kind he's famous for.

this film lacks character developments, as well as the story. you might enjoy it if you like actions. even though, many of them are silly like acrobat women jumping down to just kill one-two monsters. on the other hand, they are the baits without followup strategic offense. hence well planned suicide. like that, they just wanted to give some actions without any logic behind. the common man like chinese people (common means communism; definition) might be fooled, not the rest of the world. so this film is not everybody's suitable. it is a watchable film, but why? no worth at all.

one of the much anticipated film of the year. it was a long wait for this film to see a light. i mean ever since the trend had started from the video games to the big screen, this one was a bit late to come into the party. my guess was, that's the disadvantage. the film fanatics thinks, there are too many graphics films. besides, they did not pick the right screenplay for it like ea did for 'need for speed'.

i have never played this game, so i was not expecting it like the others, but i'm surely disappointed with the film. i had no idea about the characters or the universe, it sets in. after watching the film i thought why this game is so famous where i did not find this film any good. yep, it's not fair to compare two different formats. but the fact will remain that the film was one of the worst among big titles releasing on this year.

i thought it was like 'matrix', but more a periodic style action- adventure. i think the cast was good and the rest of the film was not. what i disliked the most was the smoky visuals. yes, all the scenes with the ancient spain was very smoky atmosphere that i had hard time to have a clear picture of what's going on. i hope there won't be any sequel to it, but if they do plan, i expect a miracle that erases all the bad image created by this part. the film is watchable, but not likable or enjoyable. only for time pass.

4379,"**the curse of video game movies.**

really, there must be some plague or curse on this type of film because the examples that deserve our attention instead of our oblivion are rare. and it doesn't take much digging to find some that are really despicable, unworthy of being seen in a big screen. i had some hope that this movie wasn't that bad, knowing minimally the game (i never had the time or patience to play it, but i read about it and saw some graphics). and really, it's a film that, in the wide spectrum of its genre, has some qualities. however, it is far from being a full plate for lovers of good movies.

the best thing about this film are the technical and visual aspects and also the action scenes, with highly stylized choreography and fight routines, unrealistic to the point of sounding very absurd, but incredible. the cinematography is very good, and the film makes incredible use of cgi and digital resources. it seems to me that the director, justin kurzel, preferred to turn the film into an orgy of visual graphics than to do a solid job. excessive attention to visuals has everything from stunning aerial perspective footage to the elaborate sets and environments of the spain of the catholic kings, creatively blended with footage in real settings such as the alhambra.

this leads us to the film's first problem, which is the absurd lack of historical accuracy. considering it's a movie based on a video game, it's less of an issue, but it's an issue, particularly when taking advantage of the popularity of the templar order, which was defunct and outlawed by the catholic church in 1312, nearly 250 years before the time of the catholic kings. whoever wrote the script and included this premise probably barbecued their own history school textbooks.

the cast is made up of renowned and talented actors, but who have not been given anything substantial. there are no characters, there are names, and the actors seem to be improvising or being themselves in some way. michael fassbender plays himself with a hood, since the character is nothing more than a walking cliché with no personality. marion cotillard, a great actress, must have been royally paid to accept such rubbish in her curriculum and jeremy irons proves to be very capable of making an omelette without eggs, going to resurrect what he has done previously in several villains of his career and mixing everything.

what really lets this movie down is the miserable script and poor direction. if we've already talked a little about director kurzel's apparent fetish for visual effects, we should also talk about the incompetence of the screenwriting team. it would have been better if they had been prevented from writing screenplays. this one is just a giant jumble of confusing ideas involving time travel, genetic memory, futuristic machines, the inquisition, the templar's, columbus, the catholic kings of spain, an islamic religious sect from persia and other oddities. the film takes itself too seriously, it is presumptuous and exhausting, and the feeling that hovers over it is existential emptiness, as if there was no reason for any of this.",low

and he actually got andre garfield to act, which might not win him a reward, but it certainly should, that is a something that could get a man canonized... and it was his involvement that made me mistakenly put off viewing it for a few years. he seems like a real actor in this, accent and all.

coming from a dc film, now ben affleck proved he can be like any other top actors from the industry. his physique was great for the role he played. thanks to batman role. this is like his version of 'john wick' or 'jack reacher'. definitely we can expect a sequel here. anna kedrick was great in the recent time with all her films, particularly the box office wise. in this she did not get bigger role, but one of the main and in the follow-up, she might get more opportunity. the film was almost perfect for a crime-thriller. especially the characters make the finest film of its kind. an outstanding film, so recommended for those who seek entertainment fullest.

this has been done in hollywood a decade ago, which is now considered as outdated, but hong kong and chinese are doing it now. what i meant was jackie chan teaming up with an american star. though all those films are almost same, like running and chasing and stunts with the comedic sense. yep, totally boring, nothing new it it, except different locations and the cast. the russians addition was new, but in the end it became a joke. that's funny to say, because it is a comedy film.

if you are familiar with jackie chan's hollywood films, then you already know the 90 per cent of this film and for the rest, you have to watch it. a cop from hong kong seeking a revenge for his partner's death, so now he has to find and rescue the american con man who stuck with the russias gangster for the evidence he needed to put the criminal gang boss behind the bar. the adventurous journey they take across the mongolia is what the film is based on.

this film is specially made for the yuan market, so don't bother if you don't carry yuan in your wallet. maybe renny harlin's worst film i've ever seen. jackie chan is the only reason to watch it, but surely you have seen better films of his than this. johnny knoxville was just okay and the rest of the cast does not look good. rewatching 'shanghai noon' and 'rush hours' films is better than this, so i'm not in favour of it.

whoa! 200 million dollar film, 1 billion box office collections worldwide. the 27th film to do that so and the 5th animation film. this sequel was made after 13 years, surely a long gab, but 'finding nemo' was one of my favourite animations, tell me who does not love it those who love animation. nevertheless, i liked the idea of having a sequel, but i scared it would go to flop terribly. now, after watching this, i totally stunned. this is not a greatest animation ever made, but the way the screenplay handled, along with other stuffs, this makes one of the best among its kind.

firstly, when i heard the sequel's title, it made me laugh. like, whaaaat? once again the story is going to repeat. i did not think it would bring a big change. actually, it was a different tale, especially i was not expecting it to be emotional. tell me how many tearjerker-animation you have seen. once again the disney-pixar jointly did it. i think appreciation must go to the director who also made the original film. great casting too, i mean the voice- over artists.

we know that dory is severely suffering from the short term remembory (memory) loss. now this tale is going to reveal her backstory. from her childhood to till she meets marlin and then nemo, there was a series of forgotten events. she slowly regains some of those memories and begins her quest to find out more. this is where she gets lost, but the title defines that she was lost before and now looking a way to get back where she really belongs.

for me, after 'frozen', this film is what emotionally got me. the value of having family and friends beautifully disclosed. it might be an animation, but still a meaningful story from many perspectives. lots of new characters were introduced and those were really cool ones. i expect theirs short animations to make its way about their origins, particularly hank the octopus and his story about how he lost one of his tentacles.

the oscars is the quarter of a year away, but releasing nominees would come weeks ahead. so it's about time to learn where this one fit in. but i'm anticipating close contest between this, 'zootopia' and 'red turtle'. coming back to the review, this is a good watch, for everybody, so i highly recommend it. i hope there will be a third film, but like i had felt before this, i desire it and then i'm not sure it would extend its legacy to further. so fingers crossed!

sure, the script is predictable and certainly wont win any prices for best script anywhere. the acting is adequate but no more. but it is a fun fantasy adventure movie, a simple adventure / action fantasy roller-coaster. plenty of fairly cool special effects. some humor, some romance. it is also fairly devoid of politically correct preaching, whining, mentally unstable and self destructive “heroes” and all that crap. in short it is the kind of movie i like.

i actually looked up the movies page on wikipedia and it was pretty much full of nonsense and whining about how the movie was not “ethnically correct”. what the f…? it is a bloody fantasy adventure movie for christ sake! it is meant to entertain! who the hell cares about whether the actors are native egyptians or something else? well, i guess eskimos would look a bit funny in those roles but otherwise…

yes it does take quite a few liberties with egyptian mythology but again, it is a fantasy movie guys! and egyptian mythology, like any other mythology, goods etc, is nothing but fantasy and story telling from the start so just live with it. to me they stayed true enough to the core of the mythology and i would actually give the director and script writers bonus points for actually depicting the earth as flat as was the predominant belief in those times. those scenes with ra dragging the sun and the flat earth was quite beautiful actually.

the rating on imdb is also on the low side but of those that took the effort to write a review most seems to be quite positive. the mostly negative ones are, of course, the so called “critics”. no surprise there.

it is sad to see how a, in my opinion a quite entertaining, movie can be so sabotaged by a bunch of, again in my opinion, loud mouthed, ignorant, intolerant, fanatical sjws who seems to believe that a movie cannot be allowed to just entertain but has to carry a political message, their political message.

undeniably the shadows loom large over the 2016 version, so much weight of expectation, in fact to some it was a stinker of a film even before it was released! well, as those who have seen it will attest, both the fans and the dissenters, it hasn't raised the bar for the ""seven"" formula, but, and this is very key here, the makers wasn't setting out to make a film that down the line would be perceived as a ""tagged classic"", and this is evident in the ream of extras available on the blu-ray releases. they achieved what they set out to do, to make a blunderbuss oater for the modern era to sample, and they have done it with much love, much cool and lashings of technical greatness. add in a cast clearly enjoying themselves and not letting anyone down, and it's a tasty plate of beans.

fuqua updates things by having his seven as a row of differing ethnicities, which works a treat, and crucially he and his writers are respectful of those characterisations, even if a bit more fleshing out wouldn't have gone amiss. yet nothing is at a cost to honouring the great westerns of old. beautiful landscapes envelope the players, the musical score bouncing around man and nature with homaged sweetness. there's closeups, silhouetted slices of panache, superb stunt work (man and beast), glorious set design, and then there's the action. the fight sequences are excellently constructed, a feast for the eyes and ears, death and slaughter unfurled in brutal but hunger appeasing strokes. there's comic relief about the place, and while much of the dialogue wouldn't have the great poets of yore troubled, there is deepness to be found. intelligence, too, the addition of ptsd to one of the main players is a notable piece of worth, while how wonderful to find a western lady character of great substance (bennett excellent), so good in fact she could have been one of the seven!

it's a bare bones story, with a pointless motive revelation tagged on for the finale, while some anachronisms will irritate those bothered by such. but if you are able to judge it on its own terms, as a western entertainment for this era, and to accept it isn't trying to outdo the source of its inspiration, then a good time can readily be had. 8/10",high
4429,"this is indeed a very good remake of an old classic. as always i am a bit worried when they make a remake of old classics that i liked. this remake is well worth watching though. despite having a few minor gripes i went for 5 out of 5 stars on this one.

most of you are probably familiar with the story of the magnificent seven. gunslinger gets hired to protect a village from the evil industrialist, he picks 6 buddies to help him, trains the villagers, digs in and sits down and waits for the bad guys to arrive. a simple and well suited story for a bit of western entertainment. i guess i should mention as well that the original western is actually not the “real” original. that honor befalls shichinin no samurai, or seven samurai in english, which is a samurai movie by akira kurosawa and with toshirô mifune in the lead role. that is the movie from which the plot originates.

anyway, history lesson is over, back to this movie. the movie starts of by introducing the main characters. the bad industrialist is a nasty piece of thug and quickly demonstrates that, although by no means being a blood splatter movie, it is definitely more cruel than what i remember from the original. next in line is the movies hero played by denzel washington and i have to say that he plays the role very well. i liked him as the calm, fairly silent, but oh so deadly gunslinger from the first frame to the last.

the other characters fit quite well into their roles as well. i cannot make up my mind about jack horne though. i did like the character but at the same time i felt that he was a wee bit to comical at times. i also liked goodnight robicheaux quite a lot but the writer really went a bit over the top as far as i am concerned when he actually left.

of course the entire movie plays out as a build up to the final big fight and it is a big fight, that has to be said. however there are plenty of things happening during this build up. both things involving chemically propelled slugs flying around and things slightly less noisy.

sam chisolm has to pick up his buddies of course, each one being an opportunity for some cool movie story telling. then we have the training of the villagers which, as expected, becomes a wee bit comical at times. oh, and i almost forget that there is a nice little shootout when chisolm and his buddies introduces themselves to bogue’s thugs in the village. said thugs includes the local sheriff. to no ones surprise i believe. so much for law and order. time for a new management.

so, fast forward to the end and the big fight. it is big, it is well done and it involves plenty of things that go boom. it is plenty of action but it is also the part of the movie where i have the biggest gripe. okay folks there are going to be a mild spoiler now. with that out of the way, let’s go to the gatling gun. it is always cool to see a gatling gun let loose. however can we keep it a bit more realistic please? they fire thousands of bullets without reloading (they make a fuss about reloading later in the movie). also they position the gun out in the open where it would have been relatively easy to shoot the men operating it. an idea that they finally get much later and manage to goof up. the final solution to taking out the gun is dramatic but quite convoluted. this is the part of the movie that made me go a bit what the fuck!

apart from that i really enjoyed this movie. a good remake of an old classic.",high
4433,"**when revenge's not an agenda, but an opportunity knocks!**

lately i have been watching lots of blacklisted screenplay films. some of them were really good, but most of them were not. this is one of those, and i'm not convinced. the story wise, it was decent, until the secret was revealed. after that part, it's become completely uninterested. because that twist was not par with any decent western film. in fact, it was same as what we had seen in those that sets in the modern day themes, but here it was in the second half of the 1800s.

so the story was the bad thing for this, but the actors were good. i liked the liam hemsworth. woody harrelson was not bad either, but his negative kind of role pushes us away from liking him and so the alice braga. it opened well, but did not develop and end well. if you are looking for a good western with the story, this is not for you. you should not try this just for the performances, because i don't think it is worth that much. definitely, i won't recommend it on that ground, but there's always people for all kinds of films, so i won't surprise if you say it is a better film than what i said.

4434,"_**“are you an assassin?” “i’m a texas ranger.” “you’re neither.”**_

in 1888, a government agent (liam hemsworth) is sent to investigate a town in east texas and its mystic leader (woody harrelson) as to why people from south of the border wind up missing there. alice braga (marisol) and felicity price (naomi) appear on the female front, both striking in different ways.

“the duel” (2016) is a well-made atmospheric western with hemsworth stalwart as the protagonist and harrelson superb in the kurtz-like role. as with “the long riders” (1980), it shows that a quality western can be made in the east. “long riders” was shot in georgia while this one was filmed in mississippi, about 220 miles east of the texas border. it’s reminiscent of “the proposition” (2005) with the story being transferred from northeastern australia to southeastern united states.    

unlike “apocalypse now” there’s zero build-up of suspense as the ‘kurtz’ character is fully revealed right out of the gate, not to mention the proceedings just aren’t that compelling. they’re rather tedious actually.

worse, you get the lieberal narrative shoved down your throat that people of color are “oppressed” in america by racist white christians and only the government can save them. yeah, that’s why immigrants of all ethnicities from all over the world have been constantly pouring into the usa by the millions since its founding, legally and illegally. the scriptwriter needs to open up an honest history book.    

the movie runs 1 hour, 50 minutes, and was shot in greenwood, mississippi, 

grade: c-/d+",low
4435,"the duel is the kind of movie that brings a knife to a gunfight. this is a western, mind you; we’re expecting a showdown at high noon your in standard frontier town with a wide main street, a saloon, and a room over the saloon occupied by a sexy hooker. instead, we get a ""helena duel"" (two, actually), wherein ""you shall pour out each other's blood and we will cover it with dust. whomever bleeds the dirt red the most today, his deeds shall not be forgotten."" yeah, i don’t get it, either.

as far as i can discern, this film is an allegorical indictment of the minuteman civil defense corps; never mind that that group was dissolved six years before the duel’s release (though the minuteman project, a comparatively less ku klux klany organization, remains active to this day).

the problem is that the filmmakers can’t make up their minds on how they want to go about making their point. on the one hand we have the xenophobic, tyrannical, snake-handling preacher/mayor of the town of mount hermon — a border town; if nothing else, they got that part right —, abraham brant (woody harrelson), and on the other, a hunting the most dangerous game-type plot. 

either of those two premises provides enough separation between the allegory and its intended target for the conceit to work; i would have stuck with the former, if only because the latter had been done to death even in 2016 — also, they had, on paper, the perfect actor for the power-mad evil preacher; unfortunately, harrelson unusually phones his performance in. this role requires a large ham, like guy pearce in brimstone, but harrelson’s dial never even comes close to 11. 

to unnecessarily complicate matters further, there’s david kingston (liam hemsworth), an undercover texas ranger sent to investigate the mexican corpses turning up in a strainer downriver from mount hermon. 

the notion of an undercover texas ranger is already pretty stupid, but the filmmakers manage to make it even dumber. kingston and his wife marisol (alice braga) pose as a traveling couple just passing through.

so far so good, sort of. the wheels start to come off when, out of the clear blue sky, brant offers kingston the vacant sheriff job. kingston accepts the gig because ""it's the ideal cover until i can figure out what's going on here.""   

in-universe, it is ideal — too ideal, perhaps; never for a moment does kingston find it the least bit suspicious that brant would give the second most important position in town to the first random stranger that literally rides into mount hermon, regardless of whether or not he’s qualified for the job (as a texas ranger, kingston is certainly qualified, but brant doesn’t know that... or does he?).

now, if it’s the ideal cover, why not make that the actual cover, instead of the cover to the cover? first of all, who ever heard of a cop going undercover as a cop? and second, why didn’t the filmmakers simply have kingston pose as the new sheriff? why do in three steps what you can do in just one?

ps. i’d be remiss if i didn’t mention a wikipedia article (albeit one that looks more unreliable than usual) according to which there was such a thing as a helena duel; moreover, ""helena was once known as the self-proclaimed ""toughest town on earth"" in the mid-19th century."" leave it to the makers of the duel to set their movie in the next town over; this is like making a film about the eruption of mount vesuvius in ad 79 called the last days of the city adjacent to pompeii.",low
4442,"well damn.

i couldn't stop thinking about this one and may not for awhile. ""arrival"" is one of the best sci-fi films i've seen in this year. everything about this film was just top notch that i can't put into words without going all over.

so let put it like this:

amy adams was wonderful in this. a very grounded and real performance. probably her best. same thing that can said about jeremy renner.

and how the aliens were part of the story was fascinating and quite clever. without spoiling anything, they had a unique look to them. like spiders. although out the film, you feel their presence. a presence that's both scary and yet remarkable.

denis villeneuve is my favorite working director. he can release a movie every year and still be close of making a masterpiece. villeneuve delivers a haunting and heartbreaking story that leaves the audience with a experience that will stay with them. a beautiful, thought-provoking, sci-fi film that isn't an action or war movie. and i'm even more excited to see ""blade runner 2049"".

and how can i forgot the amazing score, astonishing cinematography, intelligent script, and the tearjerker ending that left me in pieces.

i honestly can't say anything else. please do yourself a favor and watch it. for now, i'm dumbfounded.",high
4443,"arrival has created the most profound and seamless symbolism, notably through cinematography/imagery, that may have ever been achieved to date in film.

on the surface, this appears to be a story about humans making contact with an alien species. for those with keen critical thinking skills, the seemingly foreign creatures at the beginning are not who we initially believed them to be by the end. this film amazingly weaves an abundance of profound images/clues in plain sight. just like one of those optical illusions, which can at first appear a random assortment of dots. yet, once your focus kicks in and you seize upon a detailed shape, you suddenly see an enormously complex picture that has been there the whole time, seemingly invisible just prior. 

as i watched this film, i was curious about the shape of the aliens. they do not really conform to the aesthetic of an advanced species. while i internally wrestled with the purpose of this particular shape... it finally made sense. boom!! mind blown!!!!

i've heard people try to reconcile the linear/non-linear information as it unfolds in real time. this is certainly rich for grasping a fuller meaning and added depth. however, imho, the epicenter of meaning in this visual masterpiece begins with the shape of the aliens. 

if you can unwrap that, you'll become like heroic linguist elizabeth banks, and decipher the deeper meaning behind this profound story.",high

4453,"**a good cast and a potential thriller, but...**

at first, it looked fine. well initiated by giving out a proper reason to develop what comes later. but that later part was the biggest let down. it becomes so cliché and because of that i lost interest. otherwise, it is could have been a decent one with all the good actors. also the location was good, a perfect setting for the storyline. but not noticeable when the narration enters the second half, mainly because of thriller takes over.

it is the story of a psychologist who recently lost her husband in a car crash, but ended up taking care of step-son after he became mentally and physically incapable. when the life was in the routine, suddenly something bad happens where her young patient goes missing. following the event, she begins to experience what others won't believe her. but what comes later is more shocker, a twist in the tale takes us the conclusion.

as the title and its genre suggest, it remained truth to that, but there is no innovation in storytelling. most of the people would easily predict most of the parts if not the entire film. the casting was the advantage and they all were good, including the kid from 'room' and naomi. even though it is rated very low everywhere, as well as by me, kind of entertaining, which means watchable till the end than cut it out in the middle. not a film to recommend, but if you choose it to watch, i won't say don't.

_4/10_",low
4454,"**an attempt at horror that doesn't yield more than a few jumps out of a chair.**

for as long as there has been horror cinema, we have seen several films where the great element of terror is loneliness. with humans being as social an animal as we are, being confined (and we've seen this in the pandemic) can really be a form of slow torture, and things get worse if we associate loneliness with isolation. being alone, in a place isolated from everything, like a cabin in the forest or a country house, can be ideal for relaxing, for a weekend, but few people adapt to living like this. of course, there are people who prefer it... but they are exceptions.

this film's script is just another one that takes solitude and isolation to turn it into a painfully frightening experience (or at least, that was the intention). here we have a child psychologist who seems to have been forced to suspend a good part of her work in order to be able to take care of a teenage stepson who became quadriplegic after a car accident, which he inadvertently caused in the middle of a fight, and in which his father died. she does, however, keep a patient, a deaf child who appears at her house at night, alone, in a blizzard, and who disappears into the surrounding forest. after several searches, the authorities begin to believe that the boy did not survive. at the same time, she begins to see him around the house, and to believe that she's being haunted.

this summary is enough for us to see that we are not looking at anything particularly original, and that much of this has already been done, better and more competently, in productions with a larger budget. even so, and without ever being really scary, the film plays well with the theme and with the usual “jumps” that north american horror uses exhaustively. farren blackburn only loses for not being able to create a more effective suspense by investing more in the film's introduction and character development before launching the horror. there are films where we feel that the director wasted too much time introducing and presenting the story and characters… but this film makes the exact opposite mistake, and does not allow the audience time to sympathize with anyone. there is still a lot of material about dreams, or about nightmares, but none of it is really carried forward.

naomi watts is the movie's big star, and i really can't understand how she ended up here. will she have read the script before taking this job? is she going through a less good phase of her professional career? what matters is this: she is one of the few salvific elements that keeps this movie from being a total waste of time. the actress is a great professional and, as always, committed herself to her work, but she doesn't have the material to match, a skilful director or strong colleagues to take her to a more refined level. steven portman and oliver platt don't have the time and opportunity to show value.

technically, the film doesn't have any major problems, but it doesn't have anything that gives it flavor either. it's like eating white rice without anything to go with it: we eat it, but it's not a dish that satisfies us, and obviously we don't like it, no matter how good it is.",low
4460,"**time to bring down the remaining of umb corp.**

the series never meant to be story based. well, at the first it was fine, but then it turned out be more a video game style than the normal commercial films. so if you are going to watch it, your expectation from it should be the action-adventures. of course, nothing happens without a reason, that's where the story was born. this is the sixth film in the series and they are saying it is the final, but have to wait and see in a couple of years, whether another film will be made or they are going for television as hinted out.

the main character is long dead, that's what they say to us every time. and then a new sequel with the same character and their explanation is, clone. that's seems okay, but that being a regular thing is what annoying. this film is enjoyable, like i say, watching a game played by someone sitting next to us. but not the best of the series or the year, nor its kind. just to enjoy the action sequences. all the top, knowing about olivia jackson made me almost to cry. she's the real hero, hats off.

as i said, the film was not necessary if you go by the story. it was just another mission, a fight to bring down the last remaining umbrella corp and possibly to reveal more secrets about it and everything so far happened. i always wondered how this franchise survived this long. yeah, every time a decent box office pushed the filmmakers and actors to go for another one. the film's main ingredient, graphics were acceptable, and performances too. so, it is only for the selected audience, but you can ignore it if you are not that interested in it.

as with most major productions, ""ben-hur (2016)"" gets an extra star for production value.

bad camera, unlikable characters, ugly costumes, this film has it all.

early on the two brothers are introduced, who will have their biblical vendetta throughout this movie. clearly the adopted one is supposed to be the bad guy, while the viewer is encouraged to root for the jew. but questionable decision making of the 'hero' paired with the comical anti-semitism which permeates america is going to bring the audience over to the side of the scarred underdog, whose name is not in the title.

this movie would have been great, if it had ended with the arrest of the rich fool, who harbored a fanatic in his home and didn't even have the good sense to guard him, or the variety of weapons he kept in open display.

unfortunately it goes on and on, and no doubt ""ben-hur"" will learn a thing or two about life, love and combat during the 2 hours ordeal. but will that count as character development, and will it sway your favor back to him when he finally mounts his cart and races his brother for the final time? i don't know, you watch this drivel, and you decide.

4466,"**what is this crap??**

i was quite curious to see this film given that the 1959 version is one of my favorite films, and a film that, much more than a piece of entertainment, is a historical document, a culturally relevant piece, worthy of preservation and memory. when i finished watching it, i was seriously thinking that this could only be a joke or a parody. the 1959 film will remain the definitive version, and if anyone wants something more up-to-date, i can recommend the 2010 tv miniseries.

the film, directed by timur bekmambetov, is a piece of garbage. i won't waste my time talking about the script because almost everyone knows the story. what i can, however, say is that this film failed to honor the original material, nor its very noble predecessors in cinema, just for the almost vile way in which it chewed up and hid the original story. if the idea was to give us a new, more action-focused version, it failed to the fullest extent. gave us a handful of nothing.

despite the weakness of the material received, jack huston deserves a positive note for the way he committed himself and for the way he ensures the leading role. he's not a good actor, but he's the best this movie has to offer. tobby kebbell wasn't able to do the same because the actor couldn't stop his character from becoming a soap opera villain. there is more than one character who does not deserve relevance, starting with ester, and her father simonides, who is quickly removed from the plot. this couldn't be more incorrect. morgan freeman is the most prestigious actor in this project, but that didn't stop him from being absolutely unhappy and from being apathetic and uninterested. rodrigo santoro, who gave life to jesus, is a ham.

technically, the film has some points in its favor, namely the good settings, which even try, in some moments and situations, to emulate the 1959 film: i felt this obviously when i saw the hur house, or the circus where the race took place. the circus even has the same fish! all the difference is in realism: the older film spared no effort in creating large-scale sets, and hiring thousands of extras, to grandiose and monumental effect. this film tried to do the same, using only cgi and the infamous green screen. if that worked in some moments, in others it gave the film the appearance of a video game. even the chariot race, the highlight of the film, is so busy that we can't appreciate everything properly. it sounds like an excerpt from “fast and furious”. the cinematography is not happy, either, due to the absence of light and the haphazard way in which it seems to have been directed. the montage and editing is irregular, amateurish. the costumes are ugly, and even out of keeping with the period, most notably freeman's dreadlocks. the soundtrack is forgettable.",low
4474,"last saturday me and the kids sat down to watch star trek beyond which we received in the mail the day before. in general we liked the movie quite a lot. plenty of action, good special effects and a not too bad story. however, one thing irked me to now end. they blew up the enterprise…again. stop destroying the bloody enterprise in every movie for christ sake! been there, seen that done that. it is getting both old and frustrating.

apart from that it was a good entry in the new timeline movie series. i am not sure what all those people giving it one star ratings and calling it the worst movie ever expected to get? anyone who has watched the two other movies should be expecting a fairly action loaded blockbuster with lots of cgi in it and that is exactly what we got. personally i think this is a good thing. i was getting rather bored by some of the previous installments in the original timeline where they almost never fired a shot and tried to talk or reason their way out of every problem they encountered.

the story was not too bad although i have to agree that it did not really advance the story or timeline much. it was more like a tv-show episode blown up to a full feature movie. it worked nicely though as a action story although i would have liked to know more about how edison transformed into krall and, although that could be explained by some mutation caused by the alien technology, how he managed to transform himself back to edison.

the cgi with the alien swarm moving fluidly over the screen and the huge yorktown station was quite stunning as far as i am concerned. i also liked that the ships, both enterprise and the franklin could take quite a bit of abuse before starting to fail. in a lot of the previous movies as well as the tv-shows it took one hit and some console exploded and the warp core went down.

it was a popcorn sci-fi action flick, and i liked urban and pine but thought that quinto should have brought more of himself to the film rather than attempting to channel nimoy. it was a fair enough impression, but it didn't fit with the rest of the reboot that seemed to care nothing about star trek.

ultimately when quinto channels nimoy like that it just gives the viewer the jarring sensation that one member of the cast cared about what came before and forces the viewer to remember that this actually is a star trek film.

and that doesn't work in a rebooted franchise that relies on nostalgia, in place of a story, and then kind of mocks the nostalgia.

that is ultimately the problem, star trek was a science-fiction space adventure that was both cheesy and offered veiled social commentary about an idealistic world governed by a strict meritocracy with a strong morality and how that idealism clashes with other species and ideals by both forging alliances and making enemies.

this had nothing to do with that. it is basically an action movie with science-fiction elements and occasional nods to the cheesy fun that star trek once was. at it's core it didn't have the heart that lends itself to an engaging plot and character arcs.

and, given that it came after a betrayal, that is after they rebooted one of the franchise's best films and took away most everything that made it so great and fun... i didn't care enough to actually see it until it came on television.

the real issue the reboot thing, for some reason they always take out plot and character development and fill that void with action and it makes the film feel visually appealing yet hallow.",low

she is not a solo type star, her films are always the multistarrer. so whenever i hear about her new films, i get curious about her new partner. kristen bell was not bad, even peter dinklage have given a nice performance. so the casting was good, but they all did not get the good script or the role. i did not enjoy it means not that i won't recommend it. it did not work for me, but it might to you, so i advise be carefully while choosing it.

yeah, just like what we say in our country on 'made in china', a poor and cheap quality product. it seems they never ever see the bright side in this business (making products). this is the sino-us collaboration product and as usual the film was too poor. the animation was much better than some of the b animation features. but the universe was too small, or you can say restricted for certain enclosure makes it fall in as a bad film. that's when you observe the backgrounds, you would notice how substandard it is.

visually and basic storyline seems not much different from other animated flicks. because it kind of reminded me many awesome films from the recent past like it either be ' kung fu panda' or 'zootopia'. all about chasing the impossible dream and an inspiring theme. but still i believe the little kids like under 6-7 might enjoy it. yeah, this is definitely not for the grown ups like most of the modern animated films are. that's a sad part, yet some adult would find it better.

the film was built on the most common clichéd platform. a young tibetan sheepdog is not interested in what his kind destined to do. instead, he's very much into the musics and after inspired by what the famous musician said, he embarks a journey that would decide his fate. so how his life going to change comes with the remaining parts. there were some nice comedies, but nothing tried hard to uplift film. from the beginning itself, it was so familiar, which did not give any space for a better improvement in the later parts. an average film, maybe below that, yet watchable one. short film though, with the nice music.

the movie moves at a good enough speed leaving enough room to both tell the story itself and inserting jokes and comical situations. the two bureaucratic sloths were quite fun already in their first scenes but the last scene with them at the very end of the movie was absolutely hilarious.

the animation itself was certainly adequate although i sometimes miss the old hand drawn animations from walt disney.

overall, one of the better, if not the best, animated movie i have watched in quite a while.",high
4507,"why i find zootopia revolutionary
==============================

1. the creative design of the titular city, and the astonishing world building.

2. using colors and deliberately simple animation not just to make the movie appeal to children, but also to indicate the so-called ideal city of zootopia where every animal is pure and innocent.

3. blending more than one genre into a single animated film while keeping the plot spotless and not messy.

4. delivering many contemporary messages and tackling some quite touchy timely themes that have never been explored in an animated film before. and by giving the priority to the center message, that of prejudice, nothing felt muddled and all over the place, since no message overshadowed the other.

5. using the on-the-surface message (achieve one's ambition) as a characteristic of the main character (judy hopps), not as the actual main message. that makes this message works as a motive not as a major theme in the movie as in, for instance, wreck-it ralph (i love it, though ♥).

6. avoiding being over-sentimental, although nick's character could have been easily used to manipulate our feelings.

this movie is an absolute masterpiece. not only because its wonderful way that gives its many messages in, but also because the importance of its messages in themselves, and how smart and relevant they are. today, children really need to be taught these morals.

the talented cast's voices fit their characters perfectly. it has a plenty of funny scenes littered with extremely hilarious jokes which we haven't heard before in any animated movie, or even in a live-action movie. this movie blends so many genres: comedy, adventure, action, crime, and mystery. that said, you will never feel confused while watching it.

the characters are definitely some of the most complicated characters i've ever seen in an animated movie. each character has its own point of view due to the experiences they had, and thus makes each character has different motives and feelings.

4514,"as i write this review i have just had a thoroughly disappointing movie experience and it so just happens that i have some strong feelings about the source material for this movie so be prepared for a bit of ranting and a few more “adult” words than usual.

i have to say that i bought this movie only because i felt i wanted it in my collection just for it to be complete. i was really expecting to be, shall we say, not impressed. a movie about batman and superman, heroes that i grew up with, fighting is not my kind of movie.

in the end i realized that my expectations of crappines was not enough. i really disliked this movie. in short succession this movie turns several of my childhood heroes to bad guys and the greatest superman bad guy into a unstable hippie-like jerk that goes through the movie behaving like he is a drug addict. so basically this movie went drown the drains for me straight away and then i have not even gotten started about the plot. actually i felt so annoyed over this crap that i actually spent time taking notes while i was watching.

let me see what i noted. lex luther is a fucking joke. alfred, the same. jimmy olsen a fucking cia agent? you got to be fucking kidding me! and not only does he screw lois lane but gets himself shot after a few seconds of screen time.

same stupid nonsense about xxx being too powerful, is a threat and needs to be government controlled that has been used in hundreds. if not thousands, of crappy low and high budget action movies. i hate that crap. it is stupid, stupid, stupid.

weird and totally uninteresting dream scenes, what the f... did the writer smoke? if they wanted to pad the movie it a) was a crappy way of doing it and b) why? with over three hours (ultimate edition) it is way to long for such a crappy movie anyway.

oh, here is a (somewhat) positive note at least. it was indeed rather funny that they had chosen cnn to spew out the nonsense conspiracy theories about superman being responsible for the bomb in the wheelchair. fake news anyone?

i had a little bit of enjoyment of the movie during the last part of the movie when it finally turned into a bit of action. batman’s car and plane was cool. the action, once batman getting knocked on his head enough to get to his senses again, was a nice chunk of cgi goodness. that i have to admit.

okay, after three, mostly painful, hours the movie finally comes to an end. and what an end. meh!!! not only was it a crappy ending but they managed to drag it out forever with excruciatingly boring scenes.

i am sure a lot of the above can be said to be subjective. for instance my dislike of the way my childhood characters where treated. i am not a professional reviewer though so this is my personal take of the movie. if you don’t like it, fine with me and good for you but do not feel obliged to tell me about it.",low

my only critique was jesse eisenberg's portrayal as lex luthor - really cringing for me. didn't do justice for the character (no pun intended)! michael fassbender would've been a more suitable role.

i know this is a polarizing thing to say, but i loved this movie! i think zack snyder crushed it with the incredible production design, off-the-charts casting, and gritty take on a lost and weary batman. the casting for this movie is a master stroke of brilliance. ben affleck’s batman is jaded and bitter, taking his rage and loss out on the criminal element of gotham. his hulking physique emphasizes batman’s imposing strength over his gadgets when in combat. zack snyder also gave us gal gadot as wonder woman, which we all know is one of the best choices in the comic book cinema world. the fight sequences are the best part of bvs; pitting godlike power against a man motivated by grief somehow seems possible and brutal because of snyder’s writing and directing. finally, the world-building and teases bring so much intrigue and excitement for future films. it isn’t a perfect film, but as a dc and batman fan, it is one of my favorite comic book movies and stands out as refreshingly separate from all the bright-colored goofy marvel movies of the time.",high

however, it starts... abruptly. it starts with the assumption that you have seen the superman movies, and for viewers that hadn't it comes across as more than a little jarring. you were expected to understand what was happening from the start and, unfortunately, that's not the best way to start a film that doesn't have the number ""2"" after it.

it doesn't have that slow build that explains the story, it just kind of starts and moves along as if the audience is already sucked in... and this with a new star as batman, and a new universe to host him in.

had it taken the time to let you get to know the characters first, it would have made for a more compelling and interesting film. instead it moved along as if no introductions were necessary for either the characters or the world they inhabited and that made a lot of people lose interest fast.",low

4524,"**about a salesman who went to sell his product sold himself.**

i like this director, one of his film was in my all time favourite list. but i'm not sure what happened to him lately, he's not the same as what he was a decade ago. this is his worse to far i've seen. he's better than this, but he chose a wrong book. it was based on the book of the same name that tells the story of an american salesman whose last chance to get back on the track goes to saudiarabia to sell his product to the king. but the king's unexpected last minute reschedules avoids his meeting and so it continues like that for some time. in his those spare time, how he explores the desert country and its culture, including an unexpected feeling for a local lady doctor was told.

seems a fine material for the reading, the cinematically it did not have the same appeal. i haven't read the book, but it is short and lacks in detail it deals. the main character remains a mystery for not properly revealing his history, especially for the no flashback, which would have put him is a good position. that's why it looks just a mid story, that begins in a mid way of someone's life. though tom hanks was good, like usual in another unique role.

the film is about arebia, but it was shot in morocco and egypt. there's no big contribution from the supporting characters, except two. sarita choudury, especially alexander black transformed completely to a real areb and they both put a good show as well. the film was below average. since it was a hanks' film i anticipated something strong. it was something, but not the something i was looking for. watchable film, but skipping it won't make any regret if you're okay with skipping an hanks film. all the above his fans are very disappointed, so i hope his next film 'the circle' would make us this one to forget.

4533,"**ron howard's inferno.**

dan brown has made a lot of money from his mystery books, and his popularity has meant that virtually all of his stories have been ported to the big screen. for this film, ron howard adapted brown's fourth novel, set between florence, venice and istanbul. in the script, robert langdon wakes up in a hospital in florence and discovers that he has been attacked and shot, and that he is being pursued because he knows something important, but has lost his memory. i mean, he knows as much as we do! he will be aided by an attractive doctor who will help him understand what is going on: so, we realize that a crazy malthusian has decided to create a virus to decimate a third of the human race, and that he is about to spread it.

if in the previous films based on brown we had notable successes, this film would be doomed from the beginning: “inferno” is perhaps the least inspired and most poorly written book by this author. and there are no miracles in these things: either the source material is good, or you can forget it. the screenplay is also a poor and unhappy adaptation. because? because it completely alters the end of the book and gives us an alternate, clichéd, idiotic ending, staying true to the beginning of the story, which starts too abruptly to work well on screen. that is, the script changes things that it should leave and respects the part of the book that most needed adaptations! the dialogues and the construction of the characters also sound bad, and everything has a poorly finished appearance.

ron howard has reason to look at this film and bury his head in the sand like an ostrich. for a director of his caliber, with the accolades he has, this film is simply unacceptable. the amateurism, the carelessness, the almost negligent way in which details are approached… i would forgive a newcomer or an untalented director, but not howard.

the cast again has the participation of tom hanks in the role of the symbologist. keeping his record impeccable, the actor perfectly fulfills the role and gives us everything he owes, in a committed and consistent work. felicity jones also did a good job, with a skillful harmony between rationality and emotion. the rest of the actors are far below: omar sy and ana ularu added little and have very little screen time; irrfan khan and sidse knudsen do a little more and better, but remain in very secondary positions. ben foster pretty much counts for nothing.

technically, the film relies heavily on green screen, massive cgi, and visual and special effects. without them, the film collapses like a house of cards. i don't usually see problems in using these technologies, they can truly enrich a film, but here, i believe, they turned the film into a kind of giant video game, where everything is done against the clock, and where there are dangers so varied that we don't even feel them. the sets and costumes are pretty good, and the choice of filming locations respects the ideas and places the book visited. also, the soundtrack, again by hans zimmer, is perfectly adequate. unfortunately, the cinematography is thoughtlessly and inelegantly directed, and the entire editing job feels rushed, excessive and far too crude.",low

the potential is there, but the director is flying with one hand on the chicken switch and pulls out of everything that's not worse than a jump-scare.

stage magic and movies are very much alike. the more convincing, the better. unfortunately the action in this film, magic tricks, sleight of hand, hypnotizing people, is simply unbelievable - in a bad way. this is not an alternate universe with different rules of physics. this is not a group of super heroes using their powers, this is not a tale of magic becoming reality, this is simply unrealistic garbage.

as for the actors, most notably we have mark zuckerberg (played by lex luthor) trying to take away the leadership of the ""horsemen"" from ""jack"" (played by someone without any screen presence whatsoever). then we have a new person in the crew, an obnoxious girl, replacing someone from the prequel who i can't remember, because they were just as forgettable as the whole drivel that makes up both stories. we have woody, morgan freeman, caine, and harry (potter). in other words no one likable, unless you like them. mark ruffalo (hulk) also shows his unlikable side.

i tried to keep this on to help me sleep, but during the action scenes they cranked up the volume (as is customary in movies for some reason) so i ended up switching it off.

the magic and the magical animals are quite cool. the pocket universe (or whatever they are called in the harry potter world) is simply gorgeous and cool. the story is not really much to write home about but it does not have to be. this is a magical movie where the magical atmosphere is what makes the movie. it is a good enough story involving a bit of suspense, action, friendship, bad guys, quite some humor and, of course, a lot of magic. more importantly perhaps, the story is not overly stupid nor does is try to peddle crappy sjw nonsense messages about gender or diversity nor climate. this movie delivers where it counts as far as i am concerned. it is entertaining, plain and simple.

if i should endeavor try to find something to complain about it would probably be that the lead character was fairly bland. he did not really have much charisma. that and the fact that i never really understood which, despicable (presumably) acts the main opponent, grindelwald, had actually committed before the events of the movie.

though no-one is on the same level as hanks in this, there are a few other good performers. aaron eckhart (jeff) does well, while there are less important roles for people like anna gunn (elizabeth) and michael rapaport (pete). i have no issues with the casting, that's for sure.

4560,"**real name of this film: how to insult half the allied countries in the name of one's own ego.**

occasionally, american cinema seems to need an injection of idiotic nationalism. “olympus has fallen” did that, but there are still some technical and entertaining qualities there. this film fails to do the same, besides treating other countries (especially the british) like morons. and so, americans continue to think they are the greatest nation in the world and to compete with others like teenagers measuring their… you get the point.

the film is a sequel to “olympus” and shows how the american president will escape by a hair (it can't even be considered a spoiler to say this, because the plot is so cliché that we already know more or less what will happen here in the act in which we decided to see the film!) to a terrorist attack which, in fact, is more like an act of war. yes, a terrorist decides to send an army to kill western prime ministers and presidents who gather in london for a state funeral and all the police and security agencies in the west were asleep and didn't see them. as expected, god saves the queen and the entire windsor family, who are not even targeted by the attacks and continue to have their tea in buckingham without appearing in the film. on the other hand (or maybe a bonus?) the british still have the unusual pleasure of seeing the french president become food for fish in the river thames... but, judging by the continued protests in france for a few years until now, perhaps the french are not mourning their loss...

i know i'm being deeply sarcastic, but there's no other way to watch this movie without feeling deeply insulted. the way the film places the usa as the greatest thing in the world and belittles allied countries, (but) direct competitors in defense and economy (canada, germany, uk, france, japan, italy etc.) makes us want to watch the us committing failure after failure which, in real life, ends up happening. seeing all the international leaders casually strolling and dating when, in real life, they would be surrounded by security guards on their way to the ceremony is a very incorrect idea of how these events are organised. but it's wrong to expect a movie like this to care about things as silly and puerile as that thing called verisimilitude. when you have tons of action and a world-renowned city being blown up like a village in syria or afghanistan, what does it matter if all that stuff is credible? there might even be mickey mouse there with a machine gun! who cares?

as for the cast… what can we say? we can say that, certainly, the fee was good, and that the film did wonders to the bank balance of the actors, in particular aaron eckhart, morgan freeman and gerard butler, who did not have to make any effort to play the characters and who are here for the money. and if we take into account that freeman is the most outstanding actor, and even he is far from revealing the enormous talent that we know he has, that says a lot about the overall performance of the cast, doesn't it?

the film tries everything to entertain, but fails. the weakness of the dialogues and the meager attempts to introduce humor would have deserved a punch in the face of the screenwriter who wrote them, who must have thought that we, the audience, don't have a brain. the action scenes are noisy, with the americans running around london like a bunch of cowboys shooting and blowing things up, but the special effects and cgi are extraordinarily weak. editing is another problem: unlike the previous film, which practically threw us into the middle of the action without much foreplay, this film drags on in the introduction without it being very necessary. what do we care if the canadian pm's daughter fails her driving test, or if the german chancellor likes men in uniform? and if freeman's character is so fond of fishing, after this film he can go to new bedford, massachusetts, and choose the biggest boat he can find there.",low

this is a spin-off of the 2014 film 'unfriended'. so there's no comparison between them but you can't stop people doing that, particularly saying which version they liked the most. for me, i enjoyed the other one which was a bit different than usual in the same themed films. this one was not a single day event based film. it was stretched and developed, especially for the film characters to give more depth in the storytelling. a brief flashback in the beginning, and then comes back to the present with twist and turns in the tale.

largely based on facebook culture of the youngsters and the filmmakers applied the same old horror film formula to the rest. for some viewers it will work, particularly facebook fans, i guess. but this was an average film. everything was already seen before in different film and you are only seeing it which is associated with social media, that's all.

a german film, but made in english language and cast. the actors were decent, but in some case i was not impressed. there were many flaws, but surely they all can be explained where the film did not do that exactly as it should have even stretched further. that's the point, for being too casual, so the film looked like one of those b category horror-thriller from the past. for watching it once, okay. that includes if you have seen the 2014 film or not, because it is completely different and not fresh enough to impress us.

4571,"*** this review may contain spoilers ***

after immensely enjoying the turn the x-men franchise took after the disappointment of x-men: the last stand, i was pretty excited to see this movie. i love comics, but i never got into the x-men, so i can excuse some of the inaccuracies that seemed to upset hardcore fans. i just enjoyed the movies.

x-men apocalypse is the weakest film since duds like last stand and wolverine origins. it just didn't have a whole lot going on. one of the biggest critiques of marvel (yes, i know x-men films aren't produced by marvel studios, but i'm speaking of the publisher of the original medium) is that their villains are lackluster. the big baddie through the whole franchise has been magneto, easily the most charismatic and entertaining marvel villain on film. though we've had brushes with stryker and trask and his sentinels, this is the first movie in which the x-men had taken on a true super villain who wasn't magneto-- wolverine vs. the silver samurai aside. 

but it's almost like director bryan singer painted himself into a corner with apocalypse. the villain was too powerful and could have easily achieved his goals without the help of his ""four horsemen."" he could have ended the world, in mere minutes, all by himself. but, of course, that would make a boring movie, so singer and co. had to figure out what to do with the world's most powerful and dangerous mutant for two hours before the final climax was to begin.

there were scenes where the villains were literally sitting around the desert talking about how they were going to lay waste to a city on the horizon. there were scenes where the most powerful of the villains went out recruiting much less powerful villains to join him. really, singer just didn't know what to do with this character. how do you create conflict and drama when the bad guy is just too powerful? well, you can't. 

of course, after two hours of watching the most powerful mutant ever talk about what he is going to do (instead of simply doing it) he finally unleashes his fury. except that, the x- men actually have the most powerful mutant in the world on their side in jean grey.

so, again, why is jean not simply destroying apocalypse in the first 10 minutes of the movie? because, running time needs filler.

and that's basically what this movie is: filler. they came up with a concept that would make the storytelling aspect problematic. and rather than tweaking the concept or fleshing out the story with subplots, they just assumed explosions and superhero fights would be enough to carry the film.",low

random lady gets a casual phone call advising her sister has gone into the suicide forest and it’s been 48 hours so she’s presumed as a suicide and they’re not going to look for her. absolutely fuck all background into any character at this point so i don’t know them from adam. 
the twin sister goes out to find her sister in japan and instead of heading right to the mission, goes for some sushi and is that arsed about her quest is more bothered that the fish she’s been given is raw. fuck off. in her dreams she sees a ghoul child in her tent which is cheap jump #1 and to me, fuck all relevance to the audience as we still have no background which to me, is vital when you want someone to be truly on the edge wondering what’s happening. 

obviously the main as a blonde, her twin who’s gone to apparently kill herself is dark haired and gothic looking as we clearly don’t want to be too stereotypical do we. flashbacks contain her sister giving her a vase and saying “grandpa’s in there” so blondie opens it, revealing he is not and laughs heartily. what a laugh. she finally starts having a deek for her sister at a local place (no idea what it was as i had sort of switched off by this point) and the woman indicates her sister is downstairs. blondie walks down to the basement of corpses and in true fashion to what we see so far is more offended by the smell than the fact her sister could be one of the rotting deceased found in the forest. surprised she’s not taking a fucking selfie at this point.

she meets a guy in a bar and after telling him her life story ignites a “cheers” over a beverage, cheers to what love? the fact your twin is probably hanging off a tree? he ends up taking her into the forest with an experienced ranger, after a painful journey (for me not them) they find sisters tent and she wants to stay, fair enough. she’s happy to find the tent…. alarm bells. an empty tent in the suicide forest, are you thick? 
when she sees her first shit ghoul, she tells the guy who she was warned off (cassanova from the bar) in a dead dramatic way, “i saw this girl last night…” as she clicked cassanova was who she was warned off the best she could come up with when he said “what did she say?” was “she said something in japanese.” seriously. seriously. you could have made up something like, she wanted to knife me and fuck the remains.

the rest of the movie is probably too pitch black to see anything as they’ve gone for the angle of it’s really dark so lets just have random people who look like chucky pop up occasionally. 

ending makes no sense, the plot is incredibly weak and i am angered yet again by the sheer shit that’s being released onto cinema at the moment.

4590,"**it's not a hateful or forgettable movie, but it's far from being lively or happy.**

despite its weaknesses, i confess i liked this film, and that maybe comes from the fact that it touched me personally. being a film that is so focused on the pain of losing someone dear, on how a person faces situations of suffering and manages to digest it, it was a film that cost me a little to watch because i also lost a very dear person recently. i expected a more cheerful film with a more lively tone. that, yes, partially frustrated my expectations, and i believe that other people will also say the same. however, i cannot say that i hated what i saw.

in fact, the script focuses on a young teenager who has to live his day-to-day life, at school and at home, while mentally and psychologically preparing himself for the imminent orphanhood, as his mother is very ill and, we know it, will die soon. and in the midst of all this, he ends up imagining, in a very realistic way, a big monster that comes to visit him and that forces him to deal with the feelings he is feeling, and to deal with situations, and also with a grandmother with who has relationship problems.

directed by j.a. bayona is a relatively average film. the script is predictable, the ""monster-tree"" is something we've seen in other films, but it's always a good idea, especially if it's supposed to be a wise and ancient monster, as is the case here. lewis macdougall is the young man who will have the lead role in the film, and he does it quite well, even though the script is not very demanding on him. i also enjoyed felicity jones' performance, even though the actress doesn't really have much to do. and i feel sorry for sigourney weaver, because she's a good actress in the wrong role. it was a massive casting error, and it would have been preferable to cast a genuinely british actress in the role, rather than an american with a notoriously faked accent.

technically, the highlight obviously goes to the cgi, which is good enough and does an interesting job, especially in the scenes where the tree “awakens” to move and reveal its real appearance. i also liked the soundtrack, even if it's not the most memorable or interesting, and the cinematography, which does its job flawlessly. liam neeson was, once again, responsible for the voice of the monster. the actor is already a veteran of dubbing and has given voice to many fantastic characters in other films, so it was a sure bet for the production.",low
4601,"recently i have quite liked the marvel movies that i have watched. sadly i did not like this movie at all. the only reason that it does not get a zero or one star rating is cool special effects and a few laughs.

i want my heroes to be just that, heroes. unfortunately this movie gets off on the wrong foot right away by not only “incriminating” the avengers in the eyes of dimwit politicians and putting them on surveillance of a political body but to make matters worse it is the useless black hole of taxpayers money, the united nations, that are supposed to surveil them. that pretty much ruined the movie right away for me.

when i though that it could not get any worse it actually does. in true hollywood fashion the avengers start to bicker and fight among themselves.

the few redeeming qualities of this movie is great special effects and a few fun comments that made me laugh from time to time. even the ending is pretty crappy with the avengers remaining divided and the main bad guy feeling that he achieved what he wanted.

technically there is not really anything wrong with the movie. the actors are good, the filming is good and, as i wrote, the special effects are great. the story however is not my cup of tea to put it mildly. i cannot express how much i despised the story in this movie.",low

4620,"awesome! my new favourite, so far at least.

what an absolute joy <em>'captain america: civil war'</em> is! it made 147 minutes feel like so much less. great action, enthralling story, sharp humour and some impeccable use of the many, many characters; even introducing two new faces to the mcu. i won't spoil who, but they are massive additions and i love what they give to this.

it gives the perfect amount of screen time to all involved, there is no-one i wanted to see more or less of - it all felt very natural too, big kudos for that. chris evans is terrific, this is his best performance as captain america thus far in my opinion. robert downey jr. continues to impress, as expected.

sebastian stan as bucky also sticks out, i didn't love that character in his preceding appearances but in this i really did connect with his story. anthony mackie and don cheadle remain good fun, while daniel brühl plays his role very nicely. elsewhere, paul rudd's inclusion is amusing.

the whole film, as is normal in these productions, looks stunning. they are incredibly well made. as noted at the top, this is more new favourite from the mcu - surpassing <em>'captain america: the first avenger'</em>. i guess there's no hiding who my standout avenger is, eh?

the only 'but' i have for this is the title. it's practically an avengers film. i'm not saying it's an ill-fitting title, i get it's the titular character's arc, but i feel like it does the film a slight disservice - it's impacts much more than captain america.

that's not a big deal, at all, though. no doubt in my mind: this is superb!",high

it's a legit good film and that is odd for hopkins.

anyway, the failing is the nazi thing. the discrimination in america plays, because that was really the principal challenge that owens needed to overcome to even make it to the olympics in the first place. that was a struggle in and of itself.

but, when it came to germany it should have been more of a focus on him, and how he beat the ""master race"" and, instead, it was a little too focused on the nazis. and, honestly, everyone knows who the nazis are and what they did. we aren't watching the movie because of that, we are watching the movie because of what owens did.

however, despite that, the movie works with a strong opening act that dealt in an albeit heavy-handed but still absolutely dramatically compelling story about owens. the only fault is that it loses focus in germany.",high
4633,"> back to the 80s with rock and roll and romance.

i seriously thought this might be an overrated film. i knew it was too early to judge it, so i was not expecting anything extraordinary and then it struck me with its progress, i was clean bowled by its style and cuteness. i don't what others think, but this is john carney's masterpiece according to me. i liked his other films, but this is something i think a perfect dose of contents. in two words to say it is a golden touch. i rarely like music and musical films, and it had been long since one i had enjoyed very much like this. definitely this should be one of the top ten films of the years.

this is an irish-british film that is set in the dublin, 1985. it is about a high school boy named conor, who just got transferred from a private school to a free state-run boy's school after his parents imposed a plan on the budget cut. new school and problems are ahead where he has to come out of it on his own. during getting used to it, he meets a girl who lives nearby the school and to impress her, he lies that he has a band and looking for a female singer. so then he forms one with the amateur musicians and the journey begins for these teenagers that reveals in the remaining film how long they are willing to go.

> ""your problem is that you're not happy being sad. but that's what love is, cosmo. happy-sad.""

at the end of the final scene, there is a note that says 'for brothers everywhere'. i was impressed by that, because i did not pay attention on that while watching the film. what i meant was, this is not some teenage love story, actually it was about the brothers, but overshadowed by romance theme. i recalled my memories on those parts and quickly realised the centre of the story that how it was developed. the one who played the older brother of conor simply looked alike seth rogan and that is the character you have to watch out for. he's only a supporting character, but the impact was indirectly larger on the story.

of course, falling in love might make you do crazy things, even you can become a rockstar overnight. but there's a first step for everything and it is not assured that you will be succeed by those attempts. that is where comes the experienced hand, the brother, a close friend who stood by us since our birth. it is easy to fall in love, but it is not easy to have a brother who guides us in every move on that.

in this film the sreenspace between them was very little, but that did not stop to disclose how one's inspiration that got from love to mold accurate shape and to lead the right path. i don't have any brother, but i felt how it would be to have one. so all the brothers in the world must see it, this is dedicated to them.

> ""it's like when you don't know someone, they are more interesting. they can be anything you want them to be. but when you know them, there's limits to them.""

i did not grow up in the 80s, but was very close to it and i know how it would feel to be born in that generation. jeans, thick hair and curls, everybody was so thin, weird make-ups with strong eyeliner, big eyeglasses, cassettes, you would love this film if you remember those stuffs from your fading memories.

a very stylish music-comedy and on the romance side, this film was very cute. all the actors were brilliant, especially the lead boy whose first film was this and the girl amazing with her totally electrifying look. they both going have a great future in filmdom. not to miss out the supporting cast who did their part so well, especially the brother i talked about in the other paragraph.

all the sound tracks were awesome. i should start adding them to my 'film songs' collection, especially 'the riddle of the model' which defines this title and the film's climax song 'go now'. so from the cast to crew, equal credits must given to the music composers and lyricists from the real 80s bands. the film had a perfect runtime, i would have had no issue if it was extended for another half an hour.

the pace of the narration always kept in a same position, but towards the final quarter it has gone up. yes, i loved the ending, it was touching, but i don't know how to describe it, only one can experience it by himself. a film i watched without any anticipation, now it is one of my favourite films. todays generation might take it as another rock and roll inspired theme, but only the middle aged guys and some old ones would know how to enjoy it. so don't miss it out if you are one of them.

4643,"***tortuous, tedious and unpleasant psychological crime drama***

a divorced alcoholic (emily blunt) who regularly travels the train that parallels the hudson river north of new york city is fixated on a house in her old neighborhood. when the woman of that house comes up missing, the girl on the train becomes entangled in the investigation. justin theroux plays her ex-husband, rebecca ferguson his new wife, haley bennett the missing woman, luke evans the missing woman’s husband and edgar ramírez her therapist.   

“the girl on the train” (2016) is a melancholy adult-oriented crime drama/mystery in the mold of “derailed” (2005), “the clearing” (2004), ""snow angels"" (2007), “the river king” (2005) and even “mystic river” (2003). but it’s by far the least of these. as far as technical filmmaking and cast go, there’s no issue. the problem is the unpleasant story, its lack of sympathetic characters and the partly-troubling message at the end. 

the tale starts off confusing, but everything naturally comes together by the end and makes sense. unfortunately, the journey there isn’t very compelling and, like i said, the more you get to know the main characters the less you care for them, with one exception. the ultimate message is worthy, but also troubling if you think about it. i can’t say anymore without giving anything away. 

at the end of the day this is an ugly flick with not enough to redeem it. the movies cited above also have seriously unsavory elements, but they override the ugliness one way or another.  

the film runs 1 hour, 52 minutes, and was shot entirely in new york: the hudson river area north of the city, as well as the city itself from bear mountain in the closing scene.

4645,"**marriage made in the field never work!**

this is definitely among the top five films of the year. but the sad part is the oscars snub. nominated for costume design, but i expected the best actor, actress, and particularly original screenplay and motion picture. this amazing spy thriller-drama was directed by robert zemeckis of many popular flicks. the best casting in the recent films and visually so good of those 40s atmosphere, like it be the war or the society.

this is the story of two spies from different nation who meet in casablanca for a mission. pretending to be a newly wed couple, soon they enter the real wedlock. the rest of the tale follows a couple of years later when a big question arises, in that they have to prove their innocence. failing it could lead them to a serious consequence. so the narration filled with suspense and thriller takes over with a greater pace till the end.

obviously the film was long, but i did not mind or i could say i did not know how the two hours went on so quickly. engaging plot kept me my focus on the screen. as we know, all these years the oscars turned down the best performance recognitions, including this one for brad.

before going to watch this film, i thought it was another world war ii film which might be inspired by the real. but it was not. takes place in the background of the same war, but this is a spy film. and their personal life and profession, how one another influences is what revealed. now i don't know when such kind of a great spy thriller i'm going to watch next. i think it is massively underrated, especially stupid film critics and their takes on it was unbelievably wrong. i surely, highly recommend it.

4646,"marion cotillard, yeah, she's one of those people that you know you've seen her before but you can't exactly place her and it tortures you for the duration of the film.

she also looks so much like she was actually from the greatest generation that she's probably one of those actors that can morph with every role she's in. and, looking at her on imdb, i've actually seen her more than i thought i had.

at any rate, she blends well with the era...but, unfortunately, pitt looks less from the times than he did in his other wwii movies, which is odd given how he can blend as well. i guess the producers wanted to feature him more for the draw of brad pitt.

in either case, it is a suspenseful and emotional film and one that will sit among the better spy movies ever made. it's low key, the action and the violence is down played to the point where it's far removed from bond and comes across as a very straight spy thriller.

in other words it's the type of movie we unfortunately don't see enough of these days, subtle and straight. it's a movie that is based around the characters, the script, and the acting more than special effects and because of that it's easy to get involved emotionally with the plot and the people, even if it does move a bit faster than i would have liked.

overall, it's a breath of fresh air in the era of the mcu and over-the-top effects and it pays off in the end from pure emotion. you can't get much better.",high

like any guys from before the 90s, i was too a big fan of beckinsale. there's no one can match her beauty, even to her age of today. that does not mean all her films are good. she has stopped doing good films a while ago. every time when her films get released, i was hoping for her comeback like the old days, either a pure drama or an action film. no, not this film. it is what, the fifth in the franchise and the feature film debut for the directress of the television series.

as always, worth watching for kate. the story continued, and it focused on the remaining vampires fighting for their survival against their arch-rival, lycans. that's where the selene caught between. but this time, it was about looking for her daughter, eve, who holds the key to the future of these immortals. so the action begins where everybody clashes, racing towards their destination.

the first three were the good ones. this and the previous ones were downgraded the decent series. the makers are already working on the sixth. definitely not expected, after seeing this particular film. but i hope it comes back to the original course with good story, actions, graphics and all. this was simply based on one liner, and the rest of the film leaned towards the stunt sequences. okay to watch once, but i'm not sure worth of spending 90 minutes for it. so if you want to, then it is good to keep update to follow when the time comes to try the next ones.

based on the book 'a long way home' that tells the story of a young indian boy who lost his brother in a railway station in the night and the next morning he woke up thousands kilometers away from home. not knowing the language or the address and the names of his family, he struggled from various threats in the society. after that he got adopted from an australian family and the rest of the film revolved on his true identity. haunted by his past, how he rediscovered his originality was emotionally told.

very impressive film. the families should not miss it. even though it is a must see by all ages. i am not a big fan of dev's performances, even in his debut film 'slumdog millionaire'. after that success, he had survived in the film industry doing decent roles, for like a decade. but it was 'the man who knew infinity' that changed his career. for the first time i liked him very much in that, and again he was pretty impressive in this. the second best performance in his career. though his part comes only after the half way mark. yet in that one hour, he did great, particularly in the sentiments.

i was wondering why it was called 'lion'. and i got answered only just before the end credit. so you should be patient to learn why, if you are yet to see it. it was not until the 90s the india began to see a real change. this story takes place in the mid 80s, only the opening half and those parts were raw and cruel, especially in the eyes of an 8 year old boy. that kid was so good. just like jacom tremblay, a year before who impressed us with his performance from the film 'room'.

it was a feature film debut for the director and he was wonderful in this attempt. the film splits into two, the first half was about lost and the following half is about finding the road back to the home. less dialogues, but well written in those necessary parts. the music was good. only negative was the film was out of depth. yeah, all the events were like fast forward. if they had focused on details, the narration would have reached at least 3 hours. especially i wanted the australian mother's perspective on how she went through to raise those kids.

now i'm waiting for the 2020. i mean 2008 was sdm, 2012 was lop and 2016 was this one. the 4 years later, surely there will be another india related western film would come. despite this film nominated for the 6 oscars, it had won nothing. that's very sad. overall, i strongly suggest it. one of the best films of the year.

for me this was one of the best of the new (after the original trilogy) star wars movies. it was fun, entertaining with plenty of good, old-fashioned star wars action. i generally do not like prequels but this time i felt it was nice to get a bit of the background to the statement that “a number of spies died to get this information” in episode iv. we were even provided with a bit of an explanation as to why the death star had this silly weakness in the first place.

the actors were doing a decent enough job of it. the chatty android was fun without being totally silly. it was a nice roller coaster ride of action, improvisations, and gung ho ludicrous stunts inside and outside of various forms of transportation means.

as usual with star wars the science part of science fiction is somewhat lacking. what looks cool is what is put on the screen and screw science. when reading books i am more sensitive to such things but for a star wars movie it works well enough.

some people seem to be dissecting the characters and dialogue, trying to put logic into it as well as wanting to have more emotions and “character development”. come on! it is a star wars movie. it is supposed to be all action and visually stunning.

4679,"so, there seems to be two main points that the real haters are focusing on.

1) fanfiction 2) sjw propaganda.

now, i do believe these are both reactions to, well, the force awakens. the first just being a hatred for rey, who was a mary sue and one that gave the entire movie a fanfiction feel.

and where that is true for the force awakens, its not rogue one, at least it is not rogue one if we are staying in the star wars universe...it could be fanfiction if someone warped saving private ryan into the star wars universe and...yeah, not, it's not fan fiction.

the second point, the sjw one, well, that could honestly also be a backlash against the force awakens as, yeah, anyone that called rey a mary sue was accused of being a misogynist for, well...reasons.

specifically for reasons that had nothing to do with why they didn't like rey--at least why most people didn't like her...most.

and, in rogue one, if the cast is multi-cultural of ominous political agenda reasons...it doesn't really feel that way. the diversity works and it works because you don't really notice it unless people point it out to complain about it..

...and the people that do, yeah, it is likely because of the force awakens and they are forgetting that this takes place in a galaxy far, far away and, well, by definition they are all aliens anyway, so, you know, trying to force diversity in a movie entirely comprised of according to hoyle aliens...wouldn't that mean a lot more alien looking aliens? so, a lot of that is lingering from the force awakens and, well, some of it is understandable, if not for the movie itself than because of the backlash against people that thought rey was entirely too perfect.

another reason for that hate could be a lack of lightsaber battles and, i really feel the fanboys on this one...but, no, really this was a star wars movie that felt like a war movie and the lack of blatant force powers and lightsabers until the very end worked...

in fact it worked so well you did kind of get a saving private ryan feel off the movie, a lone rogue squad taking on the entire nazi?...sith?...the entire intergalactic empire.

it was really fun to watch and, not sense the evacuation at dunkirk that was the planet hoth, did we see a star wars ground battle that really looked like it was a war. so this was pretty cool.

and then there is jyn. now a lot of hate gores to her and i can't figure out why. she seemed like a real character. rey could have been a feminist sjw transplant that was made super awesome because...reasons. but jyn had serious flaws, she had issues, she seemed like a real person. so props to felicity jones for bringing that awesomeness to life.

no, seriously, props to her. outside of solo, i really don't think i've seen a star wars character i thought was that, well, cool, real, just fun in the way that you could point to her and say ""i could know someone like that."" there were other cool characters in the saga...but none as realistically portrayed. and that doesn't just go for jones.

the only main character that doesn't seem like a real person was chirrut îmwe and, well, we can forgive him for that because he was the kung-fu movie awesome that helped make the movie not just a war movie in space. he was the guy that brought the force into the film and made it a star wars flick...so, who really cares if he doesn't feel like a real person? i know i don't.

and the last bit of hate is because, well, it doesn't have any of the real main characters, no solo, no skywalker and...well...it is a stand alone movie, so if you came in expecting them, well, that is your fault. disney made it clear from the get-go.

what you have here is a cool science fiction war movie. it fits into the saga and it doesn't, but that isn't a bad thing--prequels, the force awakens--as only 3/7th of the saga movies are really any good.

and, as a war movie, it stands on its own. it is actually better than a lot of the war movies people tout as masterpieces **cough** **thin red line** **cough** so, watch it, you should have no complaints...

how wonderful to have had shane black back in his comfort zone and producing such a joyful buddy buddy neo-noir of considerable substance. it was eleven years since the superb kiss kiss bang bang had reminded us that black had few peers when it came to blending high action macho twosomes who are also armed with sharp tongues to match, this was after all the guy who also penned lethal weapon and the last boy scout. the idea for the nice guys had sat in gestation for a number of years, finally it was unleashed to reward fans of his work and for those in sync with the style of film making he homages.

much like his other buddy scriptings, we are in the company of two mismatched guys. gosling's ex-cop holland march is a bit goofy, afraid of the sight of blood and morally bankrupt. crowe's muscle for hire jackson healy beats people up for money, but he's a stand-up guy, likes his pet fish, even has a hero streak. what binds them together is troubled family baggage, that they are both men in search of a better world, to be better men themselves, and thus black - to give them a chance of life improvement - pitches them into the seamy underbelly of the l.a. pornography industry - with some corruption elsewhere thrown into the equation.

as a coupling march and healy prove to be a riot. crowe is menacing and funny with it, gosling is affably flaky but charm personified, and thankfully both men have a knack for visual comedy (see gosling's lou costello homage and crowe's reaction to a henchman's act of fish murder). crucially both actors can deliver killer lines, which is an absolute must for a shane black inspired production, for here there is never any let up, zingers are unbound. then there is rice (superb and actually the third lead in the play) as march's 13 year old daughter, she's got youthful zest and a killer matter of fact skill in reacting smartly to the two men currently dominating her life.

the l.a. of the 70s is expertly designed, all blink blink blinkity blink neon lighting, side-burns and disco music, dubious fashions and protest groups protesting about the most mundane of things. then you got the pornography angle, the 70s a hot-bed (no pun intended) for the sex sells profiteers, the perfect setting for black to trawl through it all in noir clobber. as a noir piece it has it all, femme fatales, thugs, conspiracies, voice overs and an array of colourfully odd characters (excitable and troubling henchmen, a porno pinocchio, a young lad willing to flash the contents of his underpants for cash!). and of course there's mysteries to be solved and rocks to be upturned, all of which is played out in a whirl of stylish violence, situational comedy and fluid camera work.

black kind of wants it all, to stay cool whilst having wry observations on the americana of the era, and he enjoys going close to the knuckle when he can, which to some (not me) will come off as a shock value humour tactic just to ruffle feathers. it's also a minor itch that he sort of snatches from his previous works in search of reassurance - note for instance the similarities between the opening to lethal weapon and here with the nice guys. but itches be damned, so much fun and hidden dramatic depth on show here, a real treasure that makes you wish black would stroll down neo-noir lane a bit more often. don't believe me? then may richard nixon come after you the next time you go for a swim in the pool! 9/10",high

4726,"**one of the best and most elegant comedies i've seen in recent times. bravo! bravíssimo!**

there aren't enough adjectives for someone like florence foster jenkins. on the one hand, it's beautiful to see someone who doggedly pursues the dream of a lifetime. on the other hand, the technical incapacity of this well-meaning and friendly lady for the task to which she so wanted to dedicate herself is quite evident. she didn't know how to sing, she didn't really care about it, and she wouldn't allow anyone to try to advise her against. as she said before she died, no one can say she didn't sing. i don't know exactly if the film was faithful to the real foster jenkins… i don't know her life and her historical figure that well. however, i want to believe so.

the movie is truly funny, and the script is delicious. this movie had everything to not be very interesting, but it turned out to be a little gem and one of the funniest family comedies i've seen in a long time. interestingly, it never addresses an issue, which is florence's poor health, greatly affected by the syphilis she contracted from her husband, from whom she soon separated, and which she never treated properly. the dialogues were very well written and deserve to be listened to carefully.

but what makes this film truly precious is the extraordinary performance by merryl streep. i have no doubt that it must have been difficult for the actress, who has good vocal qualities, to sing so badly, but she is deeply committed and gives florence foster jenkins an unusual and extremely pleasant sweetness. in fact, streep even seems to have fun with this job and her character. hugh grant, back in the movies after a break in his career, is also in good shape and does a good job. a further note for the good support work by simon helberg, rebecca ferguson and david haig.

technically, the film relies heavily on the adequate and historically accurate recreation of the entire historical period in question. i really liked the cars, the sets and the costumes, particularly those designed for streep. the cinematography is good but understated, and the effects do their job without distracting us from the humor, witty and elegant. alexandre desplat writes a very competent soundtrack, but the film would not work well without the priceless and hilarious performances of streep and helberg, in singing and piano, recreating as far as possible some of the still existing recordings of the true “diva of din”, the which can be heard over the end credits, where some authentic recordings were used.",high

i was not expecting this film, so i'm not disappointed, but my rating is just what it deserved. i don't know these actors or the director, but that's not the reason i did not enjoy it. the story was average, like it was inspired by the keanu reeve's 'john wick'. i mean, how far a man can go to avenge his pet animal's murder, but here it was a rescue mission. maybe that's how they got the title, just kidding. a very interesting theme, but not a well written screenplay. this story lacks the clever scenes and dialogues. the comedies were not bad, but i've seen better one in a similar style.

the two cousins decide to hangout when one of them is going through the breakup thing with his girlfriend and the other one's family is going on a vacation. seems everything is fine after they receive an unexpected guest, a kitty to cheer them, but when it goes missing, they plan to track him to get back. so the mission begins and they pose as the notorious drug dealers and go through many hurdles, but will they succeed is what the film is to reveal in the final act.

when the film posters released, i already lost interest in this. because those imitating posters of other famous films were totally unimpressive. beside, those kind of idea is old, not anymore fun and i'm tired of them. this is a below average film, but a decent b movie. the production was top notch, but the film did not deliver with the same standards. the twist was good, in the end, it was very common. if you are okay with a simple and silly concept, then this would do just fine.

4744,"inspired by barack and michelle obama’s first date in 1989, “southside with you” is a fun period premise that just isn’t fully realized. it’s not romantic enough to be a traditional date movie and it tries too hard to be a racially focused drama, making this talky film from writer-director richard tanne much more of a bore than a joy to sit through.

the movie focuses on one date and takes place over one day in and around chicago. summer law firm associate barack (parker sawyers) picks up his colleague michelle (tika sumpter) to spend the day chatting and exploring their city. in a blatant rip-off of the far better “before sunrise” series, this film starts off delightful and then becomes just too cutesy and preachy to be meaningful.

the film makes obama out to be some sort of savior for the poor and the disenfranchised which i guess is okay, but it’s also more than a little irritating. (the religious imagery becomes so forced that there’s a scene in a church where obama is bathed in sunlight).

the early banter in the ‘first date’ scenes are fun, romantic and enjoyably charming, much due to the charismatic performances from sawyers and sumpter. it’s when the discussions turn more and more towards race and poverty that the film begins to feel like it’s an exercise in pandering to the liberal crowd. ultimately it becomes a bland attempt at pointed social, gender and racial commentary.

this movie is short (84 minutes) but it should’ve been even shorter. there’s just not enough compelling material to make an interesting feature film.",low
4747,"**a decent film, although the story told is substantially stilted and made more tense than it actually was.**

we all know that the business world is not for boy scouts. as the film's protagonist himself assumes, you have to be prepared for the toughness of competitors and moves that are often disloyal. however, this is precisely why great businessmen are usually people worthy of our disdain: they associate coldness and calculation with intelligence and the cult of the ego, and not infrequently they see other people as numbers or as means of business.

mcdonald's is undoubtedly a huge, very powerful multinational, and the film reveals how the company was born, at the hands of ray kroc, who takes over the company, taking it from the control of the founders – the mcdonald brothers – and transforming it into something that is very different from what they dreamed of, although they were satisfied with the money they received for it afterwards, and that the relations between the three, in real life, were not as tough as the movie makes us think. the screenplay, cleverly written but very bitter and unpleasant, inflated the situation and made it more tense. like _social network_, the film shows us the controversial origins of one of america's most flourishing companies… and makes us dislike whoever built it. and interestingly, contrary to what i initially thought, the mcdonald's corporation seems to have kept a certain distance from this film… why is it?

michael keaton did a very good job with the main character and knew how to embody the controversial figure of kroc well, both in voice and in ideas and mannerisms. the actor deserves, in fact, a praise for the way he gave himself to the work. also, john lynch and nick offerman are in excellent shape and give us very convincing performances, turning the two founding brothers of the company into a harmonious duo in which one thinks and plans, and the other carries out and executes everything on the ground. unfortunately, the rest of the cast just doesn't do anything of value and sticks to the most basic.

technically, the film is very low-key, although i have to commend the effort made to recreate and bring back to life some of the company's early restaurants, most notably the one in san bernardino. the effort to be faithful to the original design was very pleasant, as was the use of very appropriate sets, cars, filming locations and costumes, which take us back to the 50s. the cinematography does a discreet but effective job, and the editing is good, not allowing the film to waste time on unnecessary things or lose its rhythm.",low
4750,"_terrifier_ had a lot of hype behind it with its very successful sequel hitting theaters this month, and unfortunately it did not translate to a pleasurable viewing experience. before i jump into my criticisms of the film, the on-screen quality of visuals and effects were top notch for a budget of a mere $25,000. it is amazing what this crew was able to do with their conditions and everyone involved should be proud. with that being said, the limited budget does not give excuses for a poor script, dialogue and performances. this movie had a tremendous amount of cringe with perverted dialogue that seemed as if a middle schooler wrote it. the performances were campy, but not in a good way. in classic horror films the camp has a sense of nostalgia and a sign of the times but with this modern film with kills and elements that are taking themselves somewhat seriously, it just comes off as bad. the actor behind art did do a fantastic job though. his portrayal of a mute killer who communicates to his victims with mimes and clown tricks was funny and chilling at the same time. the plot on its face did not have much depth to it. it boiled down to people in the wrong place at the wrong time. there was no added depth or lore to why these events were happening, although i did enjoy how each character who was tragically murdered had a connection the plot and were not just some random people introduced and killed in a single scene just to pad the kill count. as horror film, this movie failed to add any stakes or tension. the director leaned more into the gore which can be unsettling to look at but never made me feel uneasy. there was no build up to any of the kills, these classic horror elements made the movie seem extremely bland. overall, i think this film is a marvel from a technical perspective based on its low budget, but when judging it from a film perspective it left me bored and waiting for the credits.

i don't know why, but i disliked all film with zac efron in it. beside, i'm disappointed in chloe grace joining this team. a bad decision, she will regret doing it in the future, maybe she's already. regarding seth and byrne, i don't blame them doing this, at least theirs part were much better than the others. yet there is no laughs, the film ran with totally dry. maybe the youngsters would enjoy it than anybody else, because i'm sure the grown-up have already seen better ones in the similar style in the 80s and 90s.

i hope this is it, no more sequels. particularly not to end up like 'american pie', but nobody can stop that if b filmmakers take over from here on. at least first film was much better compared between these two. if you are an adult, sure you should skip it. zac and chloe won the teen choice awards, so now you know who should watch it. no offense to those who liked it, but for me it is one of the top five worst films of the year. i never write the reviews like this, but i feel bad for what this film made me to do.

4805,"> a modern chinese fairytale.

this is from one of the renowned filmmaker from china, stephen chow. the film holds the numerous records, including the highest grossing chinese film of all time. so anybody would be curious enough to check it out. this is highly inspired by the western fairytale 'the little mermaid', but totally a chinese. it carries a strong message about the marine life and pollution, especially that coming from china is obviously not usual. a great theme for a mandarin film to get exposed to the international stage. an appreciable effort with the decent graphics, but it's filled with lots of negatives than leaving a good impression on the viewers.

the story is very important for a film and this is a very simple and short, but the remaining is packed with the comedies and stunt sequences. the film opens with the introduction of a multi- billionaire xuan, who unveils his new sonar project on the coast green gulf where marine creatures consider it as a paradise. on the other side the shrunken to a very few, the merpeople plot to kill him. so they send their finest young mermaid, shan to seduce him, but instead it creates a chaos when she falls in love with him. the final standoff between the man and merfolks set to reveal who will be the victorious at the end and the fate of green gulf.

if you are a die-hard fan of stephen chow, be prepared for a big disappointment. he's out of his comfort zone here. thankfully, he did not star in this crap. his strength are comedy and martial arts, but this film was none of them. i mean it is categorised as a comedy, but those parts were too sensitive to call them jokes. you won't be laughing much because of the killing, hurting, tortures, kind of upsetting events draws us away from enjoying it. so if you think it is a cute mermaid love story aimed for children just like cj7 and if you allow them to watch it, you might regret it later.

> ""love has no law. it is beyond any rules and boundaries.""

i don't know what is the rating for the domestic release, but this is definitely an r. it is certainly for adults and not everybody going like it. looks like a film made for the local market only despite the influence of the western fairytale. it might have done well in chinese box office, but the rest of the world does not consider it mr. chow's one of the best works. i think he should stay away from such project in the future, instead make a sequel for cj7 or for the 'kung fu hustle' where his fans are very eager for the official announcement.

if you had seen all his film, especially the directed ones, then you might enjoy some of the jokes from this which is his trademark. the romance was underdeveloped and then the event followed by it that brings the grand finale was too violence. that is when this fantasy-comedy turns an action-thriller without a forewarning. i was shocked for such kind of transformation in the story. i wanted to like it, but could not because i expected something like a disney film, but it was more like a semi tarantino film.

the addition of a cecaelian character was good from the comedy perspective. but just one from its kind makes him the last survivor and have sympathy than as he's the centre of the comedy in the narration. the overall story as well as all the main characters were never established to its full potential. i'm disappointed with the writing, the director is known for genuine screenplay, but he terribly failed to please his international fans. of all, i only hope there won't be a follow up to it because we want the old stephen chow. he's better than this and i'm sure he will come strong. i can't recommend this film for children or the families, the youngster who are not very sensitive might be the right audience.

this film was different. my bad, i did not quite get the title at first. i misunderstood it. i thought it was like a shopaholic theme, a person with a shopping addiction. then what i saw was different, and somewhere in the narration it explains what the title meant.

the real challenge watching it is the slow moving storyline. dull and silent on most of the parts. but the mix of fantasy, like supernatural and regular drama brings interesting fact us to stay with it. though the most of the film was about texting and shopping. i even thought does it any way connected to stewart's previous film 'clouds of sils maria'. because there's something where both the films syncs with.

despite being a bit boring film, kristen stewart is the reason it is watchable. her performance was good, but again the mystery about the unexplainable things holds us as well. definitely a watchable film, but not an entertaining film that you are looking for on a weekend. i'm not sure who is the target audience, but surely less people will think it is a fine film. so i hope you choose it carefully.

4811,"my goodness! two and a half hours of absolute drivel. the worst movie i have seen in a long time. the list of things that are wrong with this movie are almost too many to list. 

first the good: the makers of this movie have obviously paid a lot of attention and have gone to a lot of trouble in the design of the movie. the location and the settings are stunning. the 'spa' where the story takes place is suitably unsettling and creepy. the music also is a highlight. that's where the good ends, unfortunately. 

the plot of this movie is an absolute mess. it seems the producers weren't sure what they were going for: gothic horror? dark and quirky? straight out frightening? as a result, the finished product is none of these things. the movie swings from one improbable scenario to another. new plot elements are introduced with no relation to what has gone before. several times the movie arrives at what seems to be a conclusion before picking itself up, introducing a hitherto unreferenced, unrelated, unnecessary and unlikely plot 'twist' and then lurching on its demented way. it's almost as if the makers finished the movie and then someone thought of something else to include - often borrowed from another, better movie - and they tacked it on the end. the movie seems interminable. its two and a half hour run time could have been shortened by an hour and resulted in a somewhat enjoyable story. 

it also doesn't help that the denouement is pretty obvious quite early in the piece or that certain of the plot elements are not really explained properly or that none of the characters are likeable or worthy of the viewer's sympathy or that most of the tension is provided by the music, not by the story or acting.

i was so disappointed. i rated it slightly lower than unbreakable. i don't know exactly where it where it went off the rails, but it never held my attention (and i'm not adhd- i sit though theee hours of a good bio pic. 

a good part of this was the girls trying asinine ways to escape; at other time we see mcavoy play several personalities half heartily. after all the award talk i expected a much better and diverse mcavoy. sadly, just like the majority of night's films he has his actors perform methodically. it actually felt mcalvoy was pushing his talents against the brick wall of what the director wanted.

he wasn't the only actor who underplayed the role. so did the doctor and the three teenage girls. first, after all these late night calls for extra appointment why didn't she get upset earlier or pull a personality up (which she has stated she can do) to discover the emergency instead of a casual bye--you-leave when another dominant personality shows up to the appointment.

i rate this in the same category of nights's films except the quality sisth sense and devil, which he did not direct and only wrote the original story,

james mcavoy plays kevin, a man with a genetic disease which allows him to have multiple personalities. his trusted psychiatrist, dr. karen fletcher (betty buckley), knows 23 of them, but there's one hidden from everyone who desires to dominate over all the others. compelled by one of his personalities, kevin abducts three girls, where casey cooke (anya taylor-joy) becomes their leader to try and escape the ""crazy"" man.

is this the return to form by m. night shyamalan, who has been struggling for more than a decade to release a major success? is split the movie that brings him back to the spotlight?

once again, shyamalan's storytelling is very original, unconventional and ultimately mind-blowing. instead of establishing everything the audience needs to know about the characters right at the beginning, he gradually develops them, giving them haunting backstories and spreading parts of it throughout the runtime. that said, this film isn't for everyone. the audience needs to trust shyamalan and be patient. really patient. don't start taking notes about something that you think it's negative because once you reach the third act, everything changes and suddenly it all makes sense. the screenplay is not as twisty as unbreakable, for example, but it demands absolute attention in order to catch up on all the things that matter (and the ones that don't, as well).

the production and editing team have to be congratulated due to their seamless work. from the camera work to the extended one-take sequences, as well as the environment surrounding the characters, everything feels real and looks amazing. the soundtrack ... let me just say that this element is so, but so much relevant to the conclusion of this movie. i can't really say anything else without spoiling the ending, so i'll leave a note after my rating at the end of the review with a major spoiler.

as for the cast, i'll start with the man that i honestly think should have received an oscar nomination: james mcavoy. you know, there's a big difference in portraying a non-fiction character instead of a fiction one: concerning the former, you can't really escape the true nature of the person you are playing, but with the latter, as an actor/actress, you have to deliver yourself 100% to the role for it to be believable ... and god, does mcavoy deliver! he gives 200% in what could be his best performance to date. do you think andy serkis had problems portraying both gollum and sméagol at the same time? well, imagine 7 ... or 8 characters. i lost the count. all in all, james mcavoy, sir, congratulations! you are superb!

anya taylor-joy is also incredible as casey! her character has the most intriguing story of the three girls, and she's the one who assumes the leadership of the group once the kidnap occurs. her initially unknown past helps her through the traumatic situation, but it's really her rather captivating backstory that grabbed my attention. it's fundamental to the understanding of the ending and anya does a terrific job. i also want to give a small praise to betty buckley for a beautiful and necessary interpretation of dr. fletcher, a character that offers the audience some knowledge of kevin's disease.

as for the other two kidnapped girls, well ... they're my main issue with the film since they don’t have a good reason to be there. claire (haley lu richardson) and marcia (jessica sula) aren't the main characters, and they don't have that much screen time, but their dialogue still feels extremely forced and filled with a lot of nonsense. the ending of the story might not be as twisty as in other shyamalan's installments, but i hope that people don't give up to false expectations. the classic shyamalan's twisty ending isn't a necessary attribute of his movies, but the truth is that the twist is not the one you think it is. once again, the note at the end of my review will clarify this.

in the end, split is shyamalan's return to his old early 2000's self. brilliantly unconventional storytelling, a lot of suspense, some very captivating subplots and a fantastic editing and production team behind him. the soundtrack plays a huge role in this film, as well as james mcavoy, who delivers his career-best performance. anya taylor-joy is also pretty extraordinary, something that can't be said about her fellow friends who portrayed two bland characters. the ending brings the classic twist that makes everything more understandable, and i gotta say ... i love this film, and it is one of 2017's best!

major spoiler below

as i said above, the soundtrack plays a huge role in the ending twist. that's because the soundtrack that plays right before the title of the movie appears on the screen, is the same one as in the third act of unbreakable.

this is one of the many clues throughout the film that hint at the idea that split belongs to unbreakable's universe. naturally, after the title shows up, there's a scene with david dunn (bruce willis) that confirms this theory, but these are little details that make shyamalan into a great director and screenwriter. also, it's a pity that i've only watched these movies after shyamalan stating that they were part of an eventual trilogy. not that i was not surprised at the end of split, but it did remove that first impact of pure shock in knowing that two films separated by 17 years (in real life) are part of the same universe.

both movies end up falling into the ""superhero"" genre. unbreakable is the story of our ""hero"" who spent his whole life sad because he wasn't doing ""what he was supposed to do"", and split is an origin story of our ""villain"". if glass delivers, this might be one of the best “superhero” trilogies ever.

i truly wanted to enjoy <em>'the assignment'</em> due to michelle rodriguez's involvement, but man it is unfortunately a pretty cruddy flick.  rodriguez herself is the film's only noteworthy positive, but only just to be honest - she isn't given much to work with. the premise has potential, though its execution here leaves a lot to be desired.

everything onscreen involving the characters of sigourney weaver and tony shalhoub bored me tremendously, every time it's just the filmmakers trying to come out looking smart - the dialogue, which is poor overall, is particularly bad for those two. the editing is also awful, the phoney comic book bits are weak and the transitions a very amateur-ish.

this 2016 release also has an annoying habit of telling us every single location that a scene takes place, why i do not know - and if you are going to, choose a different font. i know that's an odd thing to mention, but they chose a tv police procedual-esque font, which doesn't fit with the aforementioned attempt at the comic book schtick.

4867,"i don't often use the word masterpiece. i've seen 1,040 films in my life, totalling 1,549 hours of filmography. there's maybe 7 i would label a masterpiece with full usage and definition of the word.

the wailing is the eighth film of one thousand and forty films i very willingly, gladly and without hesitation give the title of masterpiece to.

i'm not too big of a fan of asian supernatural horror. whilst i very much enjoy it and give most films a pretty decent average rating, i find a lot of them bleed into one another with similar plots and a very safe view on the supernatural. in japan it tends to be curses that have people die in mysterious ways, south korea, a cursed object that has people murder each other are the most common ones i come across.

when i clicked the wailing was supernatural, i prepared myself for a 6 or maybe 7 out of 10 movie that was good but wouldn't hold its own too well in the vast expanse of horror.

the wailing gave me some stunning frames. the cinematography in this is beautiful. the gore frames are gruesome, unadulterated and unapologetic. the ritualism and belief of south korea are shown in their full glory without fear. na hong jin doesn't shy away from racial tension between the japanese and south koreans with a slightly historical take with a beautiful twisting story that left me with my mouth gaping open but still feeling just slightly uncomfortable - something i believe hong jin did on purpose. i was shown acting that was so well done, no matter what i watch these actors in from now on, i will always know them from the wailing. the varying supernatural aspects were unique, something that stunned me, unafraid to step out of genre restrictions and lead the way with something new. with a story line that is intriguing, stunning and just raw, this two and a half hour journey was worth watching.

this is a film deserving of the hype that numerous other asian horrors got but turned out to be predictable messed. this is the korean horror of 2016, the one that should have lead the forefront of south korean, or even asian, horror into 2017. this is a film that shows prowess, promise and skill. hong jin treats us to such wonderful skills from not just himself but his script writer, his cast, his editing team, his make up team, etc, everyone involved. you can feel the passion and love and pure dedication that went into this movie.

a full 10/10 is just not enough for this film.

a twisting, numbing, horrifying masterpiece.",high
4872,"i will go out a limb here (and try not to cut the branch out from under myself) and say that i feel this is nearly a perfect movie. oh, i don’t mean that it is one of the best of all time, or even that it makes my own top ten list. but rarely does a film live up so well to what it strives to accomplish.

it is a quiet and gentle movie, full of love in nearly every scene. the two leads have great chemistry together. laura almost comes across as a ditzy character, but the more time i spent with her, the more she seemed merely quirky, artistic and wise in small ways that matter in life.  she is optimistic and confident in her marriage, so i feared something would come along to threaten or damage that confidence. but that is not what this movie is about.

paterson could easily be a date night movie, or a “it has been a long day” movie to help you unwind. heck, there is no violence, explicit language or sex, so you could watch it with kids and talk about some of the stuff that happens. (not too young though; it might be too slow for real young’uns.) there is mild (and again, gentle) humor here, like from the scene-stealing dog marvin, played by nellie!

when i went back to school in my 30s, we studied poet william carlos williams in an honors program course, so i was interested to hear some of his work here. as the film states, he was a physician by occupation, but also a respected poet who influenced those who followed him. the book we studied (perhaps the one named for the city of paterson) actually began with a colon, like this -  :   imagine the fun we had in class discussing why he did that! 

actually, i wasn’t crazy about the poems the character paterson wrote in this film. i think the best poetry leaves a few things out, or represent by inference thoughts with word images. these poems feel like they would work just as well slid together as a prose essay. but i write novels, not poems, so what do i know, except that i really like this movie?",high

4874,"pulimurugan has lived up to all the expectations. director vyshakh has given big hits and some flops, but the new mohanlal-starrer will be the major highlight of his filmmaking career.

vyshakh, indeed, knows how to exploit mohanlal’s stardom to hilt. the film has a number of scenes specially designed to enthrall the actor’s fans and make them burst into cheers, claps and whistles.

the issue of man-animal conflict lies at the heart of pulimurugan. it is a simple movie that basically aims to entertain the audience. the movie does not dwell too much on the man-animal conflict and discusses what is right or what is wrong.

the story is set in the fictional village called ‘pulioore’ that share the land with the forest and is prone to attacks from wild animals. whenever a stray tiger wanders into human habitats and starts killing people, the village turns to pulimurugan. he is a pro in searching, finding and hunting down a tiger. there is a backstory as to why he started hunting tigers. pulimurugan’s father got mauled by a tiger in front of his eyes when he was a boy. later, with the help of his uncle, he kills the man-eating tiger that took his father’s life and continues to do so as a service to his village.

cinemotography has been reached on its perfection with the movies, shaji has done an amazing creation and it stands out from the history of malayalam movies till date

the tiger hunting scenes are brilliantly done and are the best part of this action-adventure. a lot of research and effort have clearly gone into making these scenes and the results outstanding. the high-voltage action is another highlight of the film, courtesy peter hein, who has been pushing the envelope in stunt choreography in the country",high
4878,"**no is a complete sentence in itself. period.**

there are movies that have great plot lines, there are movies that have great actors who make the movie great, there are movies which have great directors. but this is a movie with a great message and one that our indian society needs to listen, believe and enact upon.

incidents happen and are forgotten, people speak and they go quiet, mass movements are organized and they fade. but our mindset has not really changed. we still judge a woman's character by the way she dresses, the way she starts to feel comfortable with someone, by the time she steps in and out of home, by her choice of consuming alcohol or not, and the list can grow pretty long.

pink tries to make that exact same point that any sane society believes in, that we cannot have different set of rules to judge someone's character. one gender cannot be judged by some specific set of rules that do not apply to the other gender. in fact, it isn't even about the gender, judging anyone's character is a crime we all commit when none of us can measure our own selves with the same set of rules in the same scale of balance and come out of it pure and serene.

now, going towards the movie's review, this movie shouldn't be judged by it's story line, direction, editing, cinematography, or the acting. all of which were commendable in their own way so as to put through the point that the movie was trying to present to the audience precisely. rather, it should be judged by the fact that our society deeply suffers from this disease of judging a woman's character and act with her in a manner according to the outcome of our judgement as we see fit. the part where rajveer's character says that everybody present in the courtroom would feel the same way bout girls like these sums up the thought process of a great part of our society.

amitabh bachchan's character's expressions in the end personifies the sorry state our country would feel at times like these. when we have to issue a manual about the woman's safety in our society. the points mentioned by deepak sehgal that should be there in the manual are cruel but true.

i can go on and on about the greatness and seriousness of the point that the director has tried to put across, but it'd all be for nothing if we'd feel that it was another good movie that made a good point.

we need to change the way we grow up our boys and nurture them with the idea of respecting a woman's modesty and understand the firmness, completeness and absoluteness of the word no. i wish dearly that i witness this change in our society in this lifetime where movies like pink are no longer necessary to make us realize that the way we treat women in our somewhat modern society, sometimes, is inhumane.

going away from the preachy tone of this review i'd like to mention that the acting of all the characters, amitabh bachchan, tapsee pannu, and the other girls, kirti and andrea in fact, especially was just what was required, nothing less nothing more. it was believable and you could feel their helplessness. the direction by aniruddha roy chaudhary was really good.

it makes the point that hillary and the gop ran on labeling all conservatives as racist...and that was pretty true.

it makes a point that hillary ran on gender politics that called all white males misogynist in a divisive way...also true.

it pointed out that the dnc has become anti-working class...and they are attacking anything that is pro-job creation, pro-job protection as nationalist and evil (to use the most appropriate words available) and that is also true.

it stated that jackson founded the dnc, and that the dnc claims it is fdr...both are false. the dnc claims jefferson as the founder.

it stated that the dnc was the party of slavery...fact.

it stated that the dnc was the party that advocated the trail of tears...also fact.

it stated that the gop started in opposition to slavery...fact.

and the civil rights in the 186s was lead by the gop. it's also a fact that more republicans voted for the 1960s civil rights act than dems. the same with women's suffrage.

it's not saying anything that is inaccurate. the issue is that it is saying accurate things from an insanely bias standpoint.",high
4883,"fantastic watch, will watch again, and can definitely recommend for those looking for a new zombie movie to watch.

this one really had me yelling at the screen: i was heavily invested....until i was basically emotionally exhausted.  i don't think i reacted quite how the director wanted me to react during that last act.

this is a fascinating premise.  a zombie outbreak that leaks onto a train (with just one infected), and these are ""world war z"" running, 15 seconds to turn (usually) zombies.  i'm staunchly against running zombies, but when you do something well, it is really hard to discredit you for it.

there is one aspect that is truly odd for zombies, but it would be quite the spoiler, it's basically the 3rd act (out of 4).  the writing structure feels very different, it doesn't seem to adhere to a 3 act staple: it really feels like 4 acts broken into chapters (or levels similar to a video game) and as whichever characters survive the transfer from chapter to chapter, the story progresses.  there is clearly though pre-infection establishing act, post infection establishing act, confrontation act, and resolution act.  once you get past the first act, it's pretty much non-stop action, by the by.

the one frustrating part about this movie is that most of the characters seem to have a death wish: despite trying to stay alive, they all seem to want to die.  i understand that a story can't happen without flawed characters, but the things these people do are so remarkably stupid sometimes that the zombies become more believable at times.  it does allow for some of the more amazing scenes though, so it might be somewhat forgiveable.

this movie is honestly so good, i really feel like i'm reaching on any of the complaints.",high
4884,"if you enjoy reading my spoiler-free reviews, please follow my blog @
https://www.msbreviews.com

zombie apocalypse is far from being a groundbreaking subgenre. the walking dead franchise is arguably the most popular show on earth when it comes to portraying this supernatural future. world war z and the zombieland duology play that role in the movies' realm. however, all of these works fail to reach the always high expectations that come with a story set in a time like this. when people ask, ""what's the best zombie apocalypse film ever?"", one doesn't have a clear answer simply because there isn't an outstanding, mind-blowing, near-perfect flick. well, at least not until 2016, the year of release of the best movie in the genre, train to busan.

i genuinely feel sorry for everyone who refuses to watch foreign films for whatever reason. a different language and/or the display of subtitles shouldn't be enough to convince viewers to ignore so many unique works from all around the world. if someone dares to call themselves a ""zombies fan"" and has not watched train to busan yet, then ""fan"" is far from being the right description. this is south korean cinema at its best. everyone is 200% committed to their role, whether that is a stunt man or one of the protagonists. yeon sang-ho delivers a powerfully suspenseful, intense, epic, and most of all, heartbreaking story with the help of a phenomenal screenplay written by park joo-suk.

when the only ""negative"" aspect that i can find is related to ""maybe not-that-logical"" specific actions performed by some characters, i know that i'm nitpicking a near-perfect movie. i struggle to find a single real issue with the entire film. in my opinion, the reason why the latter works so well is largely due to park joo-suk's script. usually, people always think about the zombies first: how do they look? how do they act? do they run wildly or stroll? which new attributes or skills do these zombies have different from what we've seen until now? how did it all begin? is there a cure? granted, the zombies look cool, and yeon sang-ho is able to create impressive action sequences filled with maximum intensity and extreme tension. entertainment-wise: top-notch.

however, the action only works as well as it does due to the emotional bond that the viewer shares with the (non-infected) human characters. these are beautifully treated and developed in such a remarkable manner. there are easily five to six characters that the viewer ends up caring deeply about. typically, at least half of this group is expendable in this type of film because some characters show no signs of intelligence or are just douchebags. in train to busan, every single character possesses likable traits, besides being directly connected to each other (father-daughter, young couple pregnant). the action scenes are filmed in incredible fashion, but it's the encompassing emotional aura that ultimately elevates them.

it's really an emotionally devastating story. the viewer is placed in dozens of situations that require the hardest of choices from the main characters. the generic dilemma ""do i save the person i care about or everyone else?"" is taken to a whole other level with exceptional dialogues, filled with an excruciating amount of suspense, leaving me about to tear up on more than just a couple of times. every character has a terrific, compelling arc. the main protagonist, seok-woo (gong yoo), goes from being a despicable character, one that i wouldn't mind seeing killed in the first fifteen to twenty minutes, to a lovable father that only wants what's best for her daughter, protecting her at all costs during the apocalypse.

this movie is packed with clever social commentary, relatable to this day (and even more during the current global pandemic). yon-suk (kim eui-sung) represents everything that's wrong with our society. a selfish man who thinks he's more important than everyone else due to his class and whose job is more significant than his own family or friends, let alone strangers on a train. he also works as a ""wake-up call"" to our protagonist, as a ""what if"" version of seok-woo's future if he continues to only focus on his job. another character of great relevance is sang-hwa (ma dong-seok), a father-to-be who ends up protecting seok-woo's daughter when her father can't. his bravery and selflessness make him an instant audience favorite.

technically, it's genuinely a flawless film. from the outstanding zombie makeup to the mind-blowing stunt work, everything action-related serves as evidence to prove that south korean cinema does action a thousand times better than conventional hollywood. the level of intensity is ridiculous. lee hyung-deok's camera work is absolutely brilliant, moving through the train seamlessly, letting the viewer see and understand everything. aided by excellent editing (yang jin-mo) and a phenomenal score (jang young-gyu), yeon sang-ho generates tension and suspense in a way that makes every single action sequence feel overwhelming, powerful, and even epic.

a runtime close to the two-hour mark that flies by. the first act perfectly sets up the apocalypse to come with a surprisingly subtle build-up of the exponentially growing chaos. then, the outbreak in the train which occupies most of the movie's duration. during this period, everything happens. from the nail-biting action sequences to the emotionally powerful moments of character decisions that make this film so shocking. finally, a third act that left me floored, completely drained of emotions, not knowing exactly how to feel after it all ended. despite a couple of sequences that i believe were exclusively executed in the way they were to offer an emotionally climactic moment, everything else feels impressively realistic.

all in all, train to busan is arguably the best zombie apocalypse movie of all-time, at least, until the date of this review. the subgenre finds in yeon sang-ho's mind-blowing flick the masterpiece it deserves. from the exceptionally subtle build-up to the emotionally devastating final act, passing through the most vivid, suspenseful, tense depiction of a zombie outbreak ever put to screen, park joo-suk's screenplay is the reason why this film succeeds so well. a heartbreaking story featuring astonishingly well-developed characters, surrounded by a powerfully resonant social commentary, even more in the current days. action-wise, it's south korean cinema at its best: maximum intensity, phenomenal camera work, seamless editing, chill-inducing score, outstanding commitment from everyone involved, and a fantastic stunt team. hollywood should learn from movies like this. i can't find a single flaw. it left me emotionally drained. if you're a fan of cinema, no matter the genre, this *must* be on your watchlist!

4885,"premiere screening july 23, 2016 / malibu beach, california.

**‘billy yeager / the ineffable enigma’ ushers in an artistic revolution.**

billy yeager believes in the power of film and music and everything he is doing he is doing in many dimensions at the same time; 
he is not just smashing guitars and setting pianos on fire, he is breaking with tradition, he is breaking with the vanities of the world.

every step of the way we watch and marvel at his talents. whether he becomes led zeppelin, the beach boys, pat metheny, jimi hendrix or a 124 piece orchestra, yeager proves his point, the matrix, the illusion, and it is a slow and painful process.

billy yeager is a musician, singer-songwriter, filmmaker, activist, humanitarian and an all around living breathing performance artist. he has written and recorded over 2400 songs, and produced 6 films, yet most of his works are extremely hard to find and are considered to be very valuable by serious collectors, but if it can't change the world, the artist wants no part of it.

""everyone can be bought, name your price, one million, one billion? you can't buy me, i don’t need and i don't want your money or acceptance, all i care about is becoming truth, creating truth and changing the world"", says billy yeager sitting by his 1967 chevy van parked out someone in the middle of the death valley desert. 

yeager is not just making films and music, his work contains a message and a warning for humanity, and the promises that may lie ahead, but only if today’s artists heed the call of an obligation to society.

it may be hard for some to understand his ways and his artistry. billy goes to the extreme to become that ""voice in the wilderness”, calling our attention to the absurdities of the world. 

billy states boldly: “where’s your righteous anger? jesus turned over the money tables, it was obvious he was pissed off, there is so much injustice and suffering in the world, and we go on just entertaining ourselves to death? i can’t do that.”

a sympathizer of huxley’s and orwell’s ideas, he doesn't care whether you like him or not, he would rather take his music to the desert to play for cactus and lizards (literally) than to succumb to the audiences of our fickle society that praise every 4-chord song sung by an ‘american idol’ contestant. 

yeager sees the future being threatened by corporations and the music and film industry who are creating ""mind controlling entertainment” for the masses.

when yeager made his first feature film ‘a perfect song’ he attacked one of his favorite rock bands, led zeppelin; this was when they had just licensed the song ‘rock ’n’ roll’ to cadillac automobiles to be used in their television commercials. it pissed yeager off. ""music used to stand for something, but now led zeppelin is selling cadillacs,"" says lloyd, “ rock ’n’ roll used to say “fuck the establishment!”, but we all sold out like whores.""

the character he plays “lloyd” is a type of musical prophet, challenging himself and other musicians to discover the world’s perfect song; there is a great shot when he submerges himself underwater to find the notes to play on his guitar.

although there are snippets of some of yeager's diverse styles of music featured in the film, what stands out the most is the soundtrack music, that expresses a haunting and mysterious melancholy, that reflects the beauty of the remote desert, and evokes a warm, sympathetic response to a flood of poetical emotions.

who would take 1200 recordings and throw them into a dumpster? one collector featured in the film says, “it is sad,” but that’s not the way i see it.

sure yeager is an amazing musician and songwriter, but what is most impressive is his willingness to depart from the past. most people live in their past, they live so attached to their achievements and possessions, yeager’s concern is about creating music that can change the world.
 
and what artist would be so bold to propose a legislative bill that would ban those ""low frequency noises"" from our public highways?

did yeager really believe his legislative bill to ""ban low frequency rap music from all public places"" would be passed? or was it just the chance to be able to say what many would love to say but don't have the guts, “rhyming words by using a rhyming dictionary to sampled drums is not music”?

he knows it is an unpopular topic and that most artists would rather ""play it safe"", but yeager doesn't care how it will reflect on his persona or pocketbook, that’s just what makes billy yeager a force to be reckoned with, he is on a mission.

yeager is taking responsible action challenging all artists to take stock of our collective consciousness, and consider the meaning and purpose of the work they create.
 
for me the enigma in the story is that billy yeager is not just a musician, filmmaker or actor, he is a prophet of our times.

“everywhere i look, there is no one to look up to, and i must be that example.” states billy yeager",high

4893,"i thought to myself, finally someone out there is making a movie on something which is an incredibly common phobia, this is going to be amazing! how wrong was i.
after watching this movie i asked my partner what would she do in the females position of having to look after the porcelain momma’s boy, she replied “shave him and put lipstick on him” - i found this response better than watching the entire movie. i don’t recall one part of this film which i sat an thoroughly enjoyed. so if he had been shaved and made up, maybe then i would have had that slight bit of entertainment.

so we start off and the obviously attractive babysitter girl rocks up at obviously isolated house and an obviously good looking guy is there to greet here, what a fucking groundbreaking start! she walks into the strangers house even though they haven’t even came down to greet her which in my opinion is just damned bad manners so i’m already sat hoping potfingers fucks her up a bit for being so stereotypical. 

the couple she’s working for come downstairs and lo and behold as if the title didn’t give it away, it’s not a child……….it’s a fucking doll. i have to say as well the creepy doll bears resemblance to an 8 year old peadophile. she gets a set of rules which you can see her already disregarding inside her head as she’s taught how to put a doll in pjs and tuck it up for the night, at this point i would have been ordering dominos and a truck tonne of movies on the sly for the easy time ahead. 
there’s an attic. as if this movie couldn’t be anymore fucking original - we now have a mysterious attic where the audience is supposed to wonder what happens beyond the ladder! i did not, i wondered when is this going to end as i can feel my mind thinking about going back to the indian takeaway i’ve left downstairs for morning.  i mean she ends up going to explore the attic naked, as if i couldn’t be more frustrated at how unoriginal this is, like a lot of other current horrors it has quickly gone down the road to try and make you focus on the potential tits rather than how fucking bored you are by the plot.
i’d wrote a decent amount of things to comment on for after the film but truth be told - all i can say to truly summarise it would be hollywood horror. the jumps are cheap, the twists are obvious and brahms (child) just turns into more of a pervert as the movie progresses. if the girl was feeling that fucked up by what was happening surely you’d just get a heavy object and smash his porcelain face in? well, being quicker about doing this anyways. (oops spoiler alert, but if you hadn’t seen that coming then i’m going to guess you’re someone who watched this and thought it was pure golden). 

if you ask me, all brahms wanted was a bit of action judging by him acting like a randy teenager during the movie, even encased in a pot shell there was no stopping the lad from trying to scope her in the shower. gotta give it to him for that i guess.

terrible. avoid. stay clear.

this film is the origin story of diana prince/wonder woman (gal gadot), who was first introduced in batman v. superman last year. she is born and trained on themyscira, the hidden island where the powerful warrior women known as the amazons live. one day, steve trevor (chris pine), an american world war i spy, crashes off the coast of themyscira and is rescued by diana and the two team up to take down ares, the god of war, and the germans, who are developing a very deadly form of mustard gas. there are fantastic action sequences in this film, especially by gal gadot. it's amazing to see her single-handedly storm the german front, inspiring the allies to fight with her. gadot takes over from the legendary linda carter and makes the role her own. she has great chemistry with pine. they are complete equals in this film. it's refreshing to see the female lead in a superhero film not be the love interest. the only negative part of the film are the lackluster villains. hopefully, wonder woman will have more formidable foes in future films.",high
4903,"i truly enjoyed wonder woman after diana’s bvs intro with that amazing theme music.
i was disappointed diana didn’t have the bullets and bracelets contest to return steve to man’s world.
director patty jenkins must have watched justice league the animated series because diana stole her costume in that episode.
i read moviegoers review  the 3rd act as a heavy cgi fest but but butt diana’s a demi god fighting ares,the god of war certainly they wouldn’t be mimicking a saturday morning wwe wrestling match.
traveling by ship instead of invisible plane was another missed opportunity to stay true to the cb.
the themyscria healing waters was okay i would have liked the purple healing ray - but but butt director patty jenkins kept with the au naturel order of mother earth no guns, no electricity, no meat/fish only fruits and vegetables honouring the harvest goddess.

4904,"**overall : wonder woman exceeds the high expectations of existing fans while winning new fans with its amazing action, fantastic visuals, and sincere characters.**

zack snyder’s casting of gal gadot as wonder woman was a masterstroke that shined in its full brilliance in this film. while i had high hopes for patty jenkins’ wonder woman, i didn’t expect this kind of excellence! gal gadot delighted as the powerful yet compassionate diana. jenkins carried that balance of elegance and strength throughout the entire film. the no man’s land scene stands out as one of the best action scenes in a comic book movie. wonder woman is full of fun, action, grace, and significance, making it a true stand-out in the ever-growing ocean of comic book films.",high
4905,"ok, calm down....i am going to address the ""controversy"" around this first...and i can't believe i just had to write that. it's freaking wonder woman!!!!! i can see the x-men being controversial, what with being primarily about civil rights and equality for minorities...but this is dc comics.

ok, so let me put it this way...

...i do not think that wonder woman is the greatest female protagonist in an action movie or sci-fi movies...and i am not a misogynist.

my ""lack of respect"" of wonder woman doesn't stem from a hatred of strong female leads...i just think sarah conner (especially in ""terminator the sarah conner chronicles"") is the absolute coolest and most bada$$ strong female lead that has ever graced the silver screen or your home television.

not only that, i was livid when it got canceled and, for the cherry on top, if you want a strong female role model...have one with the cold soldier discipline and the willingness to sacrifice her life for the mission that sarah conner has.

not only that, but to be further controversial, i don't believe that wonder woman is the first awesome strong female lead in an action movie. i mean, ellen ripely is almost as pure awesome as sarah conner...and who can forget buffy, ok buffy is touchy, when i mention her i am talking about buffy from the tv show, not buffy from the movie.

those are only to name a few. and then there are lesser ones that we hate yet still came before wonder woman....most recently the ghost busters and mary sue from the new star wars.

so cool down on the politics...people that don't think wonder woman is the greatest female lead aren't necessarily misogynists forcing a male agenda....they may just be aware of sarah conner and echo.

now...back to wonder woman.

why does it have to be dark, realistic, and gritty?!?!?! seriously, i only like one (1) of the nolan batman movies and...wonder woman and superman and the justice league are not batman.

i don't want to sit through a super hero movie that is bucking for ultra-realistic. if i wanted that, i'd see a drama.

there are few super heroes that you can go totally dark and gritty with, batman, dare devil, green arrow....

speaking of green arrow, notice how he was dark and the flash wasn't? why can the wb understand this but not the film department? what you have here is a director trying to make a batman movie using wonder woman and that doesn't work. if i want a dark and gritty female action protagonist i already have the terminator and alien franchises.

the director, the studio, the writers should have concentrated more on making a wonder woman film and not another batman movie...this failed for the same reason batman v superman did.",high
4906,"**a film that recreates the modus vivendi of the 50s suburbs, but fails to give us a story with tension and suspense that we can adhere to.**

any cohen brothers film is always a film that promises not to be like any other. their style is quite unique and does not suit everyone. and this time they bring us a film that is entirely about the importance of appearances, the rottenness they cover up, and a certain self-destruction latent beneath an impeccable appearance. it's a film that tries to teach us that nothing is what it seems, nothing is perfect, there are no paradises on earth, and everything that seems too perfect always has something decadent or spoiled behind it. yet another film that promises to annoy those who see it... a nuisance that helps us understand why the film was so poor at the box office.

this is the lesson of suburbicon, a seemingly perfect and very friendly community, all white caucasians, with impeccable houses, cars and lawns, which will begin to experience days of enormous turmoil and riot when a black family decides to move there. the family in question seems as impeccable as they are, and as wealthy as any of their neighbors... but they are black, and that is enough to be undesirable in the eyes of the neighbors. at the same time, one of those impeccable families begins to implode after a home invasion results in a murder and, days later, an inspector shows up, thinking it's all a crime committed to grab the life insurance money.

as we can see, the script is not difficult to describe succinctly, despite joining two plots that, alone, could make a solo film. set in the 1950s, the film shows us how the suburban neighborhood was born, with a large urbanization boosted by the growing prosperity and purchasing power of a rapidly growing middle class. however, throughout the film, the feeling of artificiality and falsehood that surrounds the neighborhood (and that ideal family in particular) is accentuated, in proportion to the suspicions of the authorities and the hostility towards the black family. unfortunately, the film fails to convey that tension to the audience, and the atmosphere is never as thick and disturbing as it should be.

george clooney may not be part of the cast, but he ensures a safe direction and is aware of what he wants... although he doesn't seem to know exactly how to get there! he takes great efforts in the most technical and artistic points, in the sets design, in the recreation of the period, but he fails to shape the environment in such a way that the tension and suspense can be built up on the way to the climax, nor that the cast corresponds with the same effort and commitment. the proof is matt damon, who brings the protagonist to life in a lukewarm way, similar to what he did in _good shepherd_ (the similarity between characters, from a visual and behavioral point of view, is huge and not pleasant). julianne moore turns out to be the best actress here, with a good performance where she combines a calculating and meticulous spirit with an appearance of an ideal housewife.

technically, it's a well-executed film on many levels: the cinematography is colorful, vivid, and the filming work was well done. the sets manage to resurrect the idyllic appearance of the middle-class suburb of the 50s, with the sets betting on period furniture and colors between green and pink. the cars are an important part of the movie, and they are all magnificent. the costumes, most particularly moore's, are also excellent and bring back the women's fashion of that period. alexander desplat signs the soundtrack and does a very well executed job.",low
4907,"the coens are experts in their ability to write a political satire, or a movie with a strong political message, and make it feel natural and organic to the plot so much so that, even if you don't agree with whatever they are trying to say, you don't care because they are still telling a great story...and the story always comes first.

however, put george clooney at the helm and all the talent that the coens have for expertly into a stylish story goes straight out the window.

and the result is...a bore.

clooney put the politics above the story and you can tell. it felt preachy, it felt pretentious, it felt like a lecture...what it didn't feel like was entertainment.

but that's what happens when you have a great script with a strong political message...and you decide that the political message has to be front and center, in your face, at the expense of actually telling a story.

had the coen's actually directed it, they could have sold the audience the same message, without making it feel like it was forced down your throat.",low

i didn't like either of them.

marvel had never interested me growing up. i was a batman-kid through and through, so as hard as a decision as it was to make, i decided i wouldn't be back to watch this run of dc movies, because for me, it was three swings, three misses.

enter _wonder woman_ earlier this year. though i had decided to not give this film series any more of money, i went back on my word and watched it opening weekend. half ""one-last-hail-mary"" and half ""i don't mind voting with my money to see more female-led superhero movies"". i loved it so much, that i was instantly back on the dc universe train.

now we have _justice league_.

i like to rank franchises according to my personal tastes. when it comes to what i refer to as the ""dcithoughtshewaswithu"" i dislike _man of steel_, _bvs_ & _suicide squad_ all roughly the same amount for different reasons, so it's tough to work out which comes in second place, which is third an which is fourth. but as surely as i know that _wonder woman_ comes first, _justice league_ comes last.

4917,"the much-anticipated justice league, the follow-up to 2016’s batman v superman: dawn of justice, was finally released on november 17, 2017. after batman v superman and suicide squad were both negatively received, warner bros. saw a glimmer of hope with the highly-received wonder woman and hoped this would push the dceu forward onto greatness. i saw justice league on the 19th of november and my consensus: it’s not good. opening to $94 million for its first weekend and with a 40% rating on rotten tomatoes, justice league underperformed both financially and critically. 10 years ago, i would have laughed at the idea of a guardians of the galaxy film beating justice league at the box office and be much better received. justice league’s performance puts the future of the dceu in jeopardy.
due to a personal tragedy in zack snyder’s life, he stepped down as director and joss whedon (director of the avengers and avengers: age of ultron) took over post-production with reshoots and filming additional scenes. most would have assumed that because of joss whedon’s reputation, he would be a great asset to the production of justice league. however, that was strongly not the case. zack snyder intended to make this movie with a much lighter tone than batman v superman, but zack snyder’s style just does not blend well with joss whedon’s. what we’re left with is a dc film badly trying to be a marvel film and the tone is an inconsistent mess throughout. the film loses its sense of identity and doesn’t know what tone (light or dark) it wants to incorporate. thanks to warner bros. meddling with the production of the film and purposely sabotaging zack snyder’s vision (as much as i dislike his directing style), we’re left with a film full of sloppy editing and pacing, inconsistent tone, forgettable/unmemorable music, rushed “development” of characters, a terribly developed villain, thin plot and clunky cgi throughout. 

the movie directly follows the death of superman in the previous film, triggering a sense of fear in people and allowing steppenwolf and his army of parademons to seek the 3 mother boxes on earth to trigger a mass transformation of the planet. but instead of showcasing his initial invasion on earth, the film starts off with disjointed scenes that don’t connect with one another. first with a video recording of superman looking like he doesn’t want to even be recorded, then jumps to batman using a criminal to capture a parademon, then again to wonder woman thwarting a terrorist plot (which has nothing to do with the overall narrative), then jumps to a fully-bearded bruce wayne attempting to recruit aquaman. there is no smooth transition between scenes and just results in a jumbled mess that really doesn’t show us a sense of urgency as to why diana and bruce want to recruit a team of meta-humans. 

the movie should really give us a reason as to why steppenwolf should be feared, but instead, he is portrayed as a generic, badly rendered cgi figure that utters generic villain dialogue and just suddenly appears in themiscyra through a boom tube. we are not given a scene showing who steppenwolf is or why he’s returned to earth before arriving to themiscyra. while there is a scene showing steppenwolf’s original invasion on earth and his subsequent defeat by the combines forces of humans, atlanteans, amazonians and green lanterns, it’s narrated by wonder woman and misplaced during a random moment when she’s explaining the mother boxes after he has invaded themiscyra. the movie should have started off with developing a strong sense of interest for steppenwolf and his reason for obtaining the mother boxes (is he doing this on his own accord or is a higher being – darkseid – ordering him to do so?). then show his original invasion on earth without having wonder woman to tell us about steppenwolf. steppenwolf is basically loki: they both wore a helmet with horns, they were both given orders by a higher being to retrieve a box (or boxes), they both commanded an army of disposable cgi monsters, they both arrived to earth through a portal, and both attempted to conquer the world. but the big difference? loki is actually likeable, while steppenwolf is greatly forgettable. 

superman, the “beacon of hope” as described by bruce wayne, is nothing of the sort. he was portrayed as a strongly brooding figure in both man of steel and batman v superman, but we do not once see superman acting as this beacon. instead, he looked as if he hates saving people and always has a blank expression on his face. there is no sense of romance between him and lois or him being a beacon of hope, we’re just told that and are expected to believe that. however, his character sees much improvement in justice league. one of the aspects i enjoyed about the film was actually superman. in the film’s climax, he actually felt and acted like the superman we all knew and loved in the past (excluding his two previous films). his revival was quite satisfying, especially when bruce knew he may not be the same person as before. then we’re given a glimpse into an evil superman where he easily manages to take on all the justice league members. what i especially liked was seeing the flash attempt to run behind superman and as he’s in the speed force, superman moves his eyes and head to stare directly at barry, catches him off-guard and he’s left with a “wtf” expression on his face. this was honestly one of the best moments of the entire film, but is very short-lived. lois lane comes to the rescue and seems to knock superman out of his disoriented state and they fly back to smallville. after some brief dialogue, superman seems to be back to his old self. i just felt his state of mind reverting back to his original self was rushed and relied heavily on lois lane to do the job.

batman is seen as the weakest member of the justice league and is turned into a complete joke in this film. he even utters one-liners and is a much more light-hearted character in stark contrast to his debut in batman v superman. it’s very out of character for bruce wayne/batman to be this way. it makes him seem like the dc equivalent of tony stark. it’s also apparent that ben affleck wants to no longer play batman, i can totally tell that he just doesn’t seem to care anymore about the role. but he is given terrible material to work with, and i can understand why he would want to stop playing the role. i just hope ben affleck can see a glimmer of hope in the upcoming batman solo reboot. 

not much to say about wonder woman, since her solo film was spectacular and she continued to be damn amazing in this film, but i was utterly disgusted that dc felt it was necessary to overly-sexualize her by capturing close shots of her chest and ass. they even get up-skirt shots of her. it undermines her character established in her solo film and delegates her to being mere eye candy in the eyes of men. plus the terrorist plot she thwarted, though it was an awesome moment, has no purpose and was a waste of screen time.

cyborg is easily the least interesting character of the group. there’s brief development that i assume he holds resentment towards his father for bringing him back as “monster.” we’re not given an inner struggle with cyborg struggling to deal with the fact of his condition, but the film has to quickly gloss over the justice league members introduced in batman v superman via e-mail attachment in order to form the team. his only shining moment is in the final battle where he is the only one that can separate the mother boxes before steppenwolf can enact his plan. but in batman v superman, from the video file, it seemed as if the mother box fused with cyborg, so why is the box still a separate entity? it should have been fused with cyborg and would raise the stakes a bit higher because steppenwolf could use cyborg to fuse with the other mother boxes and would force the justice league to do everything in their power to save him. 

ezra miller’s the flash seems to be dc’s response to tom holland’s spider-man. however, the flash is a much worse version of spider-man with very cringe-worthy dialogue. he’s socially awkward and without hesitation, he immediately agrees to join bruce wayne for the reason of wanting friends. what the hell? we saw some development with barry allen striving to prove his father’s innocence, but why join the justice league for the sole purpose of making friends? plus he even explains to batman that he has never been in a battle, yet he was shown to be the one that apprehended captain boomerang. he is never given a shining moment except for saving a family in russia and challenging superman to a race in the mid-credits scene. 

jason momoa as aquaman was actually amazing, though he is bogged down by very limited screen time and little to no development. it honestly makes me quite excited for the upcoming aquaman solo film slated for release late-2018. but a major annoyance i had with aquaman was that he completely disappears from the movie after fighting off steppenwolf, then suddenly reappears when the team is fighting steppenwolf and parademons in the sewers. there is no explanation as to how he arrived to the sewers, he just appears there. and that is the only time we truly see his powers is when he stops a column of water from flushing them out. in the final battle, they are nowhere near a water source, so what good is aquaman if he cannot use his powers? however, it leaves me wanting to know more about aquaman. despite those annoyances, i thought the scene where aquaman is unknowingly sitting on the lasso of truth and starts to speak the truth about their situation was fantastic and quite humorous, especially his reaction to when he realizes he was sitting on the lasso. 

the final battle between steppenwolf and his army of parademons against the justice league has very low stakes and takes place in an obscure location in russia. unlike the avengers, where the battle took place in new york and resulted in severe collateral damage, which raised the stakes a lot, justice league’s climax doesn’t have a sense of world-ending urgency. it’s just a giant cgi battle with the only memorable moment being aquaman riding a parademon through a building. there’s no shining moments like hulk slamming loki or hawkeye jumping off the building and shooting at the chitauri as he’s falling. as cyborg is struggling to separate the mother boxes, superman appears when all hope seems to be lost and absolutely beats the shit out of steppenwolf, breaking his weapon and his own parademons attack him since they smell his fear of defeat. it made steppenwolf seem like nothing but a giant push-over. but what especially irks me is that the original plan was to have steppenwolf attempt to sway superman to join him, superman is given an apocalyptic vision( similar to the one batman saw) and he actually sees darkseid and this snaps superman out of it and he delivers the final blow to defeat steppenwolf. 

though it’s a competent film and i really wanted to enjoy this film, justice league is a complete let-down that should have been a huge movie event. given its box office numbers and critical reception, this puts the future of the dceu in a troubling position. they really should have given each of the heroes a solo film before releasing justice league, but it’s apparent that warner bros. was way more concerned with catching up with marvel than actually developing a shared universe with well-developed characters. justice league just did not resonate with me and we can mainly thank warner bros. for rushing this film and delivering a disappointing product. 

closing comments 
- when cyborg links up to the nightcrawler, alfred asks him if he knows him. alfred and diana were in the batcave together when cyborg reached out to them, alfred should have recognized his voice completely.
- steppenwolf should have been a much better-developed villain with a well-defined purpose.
- mixing the styles of two directors in this film gave it a wildly inconsistent tone. 
- the humor, thought it did lighten up the mood, doesn’t work well with zack snyder’s style and feels out of place. 
- what was the deal with putting so much focus on that russian family? it takes you out of the element of the final battle and is a cheap attempt at raising the stakes.
- when steppenwolf was first defeated thousands of years ago, why did they all entrust the humans with a mother box? shouldn’t the green lantern corps be alerted that one of their own perished in the battle? they could have taken the mother box back with them, but they didn’t.
- overall, the movie suffers from trying to do too much with too little time. dc really needs to reevaluate their future releases and as much as we all want another justice league, they should put all their focus on standalone titles to fully flesh out their characters for now.
- that post-credits scene featuring slade wilson/deathstroke visiting a recently escaped and bald lex luthor is a set-up for the injustice league/legion of doom, which would make for an interesting idea for the justice league sequel (if it does happen).

4918,"this was my type of super hero movie. simple, straightforward plot without much social nonsens and preaching. little in terms of the all too common whining and sel pitying by the heroes. they are heroes all the way without any nonsensical vendettas or moral bullshit (mostly). there is an episode with a temporary memory lapse and some unnecessary slowdown but it is quickly dealt with.

on wikipedia you can read that the movie was criticized for its “overuse of cgi”. well, go watch another movie then for christ sake! news flash: it is a super hero movie! there are supposed to be a shitload of cgi in a super hero movie. personally i enjoyed every second of the fx loaded scenes.

i am quite happy to finally see a real super hero movie and especially to see batman and superman again after that utterly abysmal train wreck batman v. superman.

i liked all the heros in this movie. the flash was a bit silly at times but it was bearable. gal gadot is as hot (i had to say it) as ever as wonder woman. there are a few comical moments but luckily they are not overdone. aquaman accidentally sitting on wonder woman’s “truth lasso” was quite hilarious actually.

the sf was generally great. i really liked the explosive action scenes. the colorful tendrils that invaded the land around steppenwolf’s lair was a bit si-so though. they should have kept them just black and red at least.
steppenwolf himself was okay. from a distance he was pretty great but up close (and there was really too many up close scenes of him) he looked…not so great, especially when talking.

there are a couple of stupid faults of course. usually involving the good guys just standing around looking while the bad guy screws them. leaving the, obviously, all important third mother box unguarded and the lust looking stupid when steppenwolf grabbed it was a real low.

anyway, i really liked this movie. i do hope we get more like it.",high

beyond that the movie was awful. well, it was awful in a totally boring kind of way...and this was a superhero movie. they managed to make it boring.

part of it could be that, like wonder woman, it tried to be too dark and serious, but even then wonder woman was a hell of a lot more fun...even if they tried to make her film into yet another batman movie. at least she had her moments.

in justice league, only she had her moments. seriously. the flash, well, he really didn't do anything that wasn't forced, but then aquaman, he had a moment...but it was forced.

the trailer didn't show much, which is good.  i hate trailers that give away everything about a movie.  
so, a hot girl is always good...   
and it had the teaser nudity that isn't real but is a suit - i'll let you be the judge of that.
the rest is the same old overused nonsense from all other science fiction movies:
a lot of fighting, shooting, explosions and destruction - way too much of that... but just about all sci-fi and superhero movies these days only contain that.
the first hour was incredibly boring.  after about 70 minutes, it got just slightly interesting and then all the fighting/shooting/destruction began.  there is nothing interesting about that - we've all see that hundreds of times. it's ridiculous.
why can't any of these shooters hit anything?  we still have that.  it isn't interesting to watch.  thousands of rounds flying and everyone missing their target.  with all this high tech stuff, why don't they have more advanced weapons?
i have to say, i was in arizona earlier this year and fired a handgun for the very first time.  it was a 6-shooter, a colt ""peacemaker"", you know the pistol of the ""west"".  you don't ""aim"" those, you lift them to just above waist high, look at your target & not the gun, and pull the trigger. after just a few shots, it starts to become very natural. any sane person can hit a target the size of a person at least somewhere on their body, even if they are moving.  24 rounds: i had 24 hits & 0 misses at various distances. but the people in these movies can't hit anything even when they do aim and with much better weapons.  
and then you have major, her manufactured body can stretch & tear, wires breaking, and it can still function?  uh, no, it wouldn't.  that's not how mechanics and electronics work.
the city: a ridiculous ""blade runner""/""fifth element"" type of city but with fish floating around.  no, not interesting at all. just very silly.
oh, one petty but very annoying thing: they can build an entire body and install a human brain in it and get everything to work but they can only give her a ragged, jagged wig or haircut?  that's very weird.  her crooked bangs were a distraction in every scene that included her facing the viewer.

in summary: this movie has a lot of awesome cgi with a ridiculous plot and horrible acting.  great cgi alone doesn't make a great, or even a good, movie.  this catastrophe is a perfect example of that.",low

4952,"i must confess that i did have higher hopes for this movie. i’m not sure what the script writers was up to when writing it but they really seem to have a very low opinion of the audience’s intelligence. either that or it was written for a very young audience.

there were parts of the movie that was quite fun to watch but on the whole it was pretty much a mess. it is a shame because it had quite a bit of promise. the core of the plot was not too bad although i really wish that hollywood writers would stay away from plots involving computer gadgetry. their knowledge in that area simply stinks. thus the gadget that the entire movie was spun around was simply stupid.

unfortunately another core plot element was the crooked cia (or whatever department it was supposed to be) boss that of course had to do some senseless backstabbing just to prolong the movie. tiresome, overused and boring. i know, i know with fucktards like comey i guess one could say that it would not be too far from the truth but it is still tiresome, overused and boring.

since i am on a rant anyway let’s go on to the various stunts and special effects. it is a long time since i watched a movie where the stunts were so obviously and totally overdone and unrealistic. i mean, they were unrealistic to the point where i started to wander if it was a slapstick comedy i was watching.

all of this really dragged down the movie … a lot!

on the good side. i did like many of the wacky characters. it is a shame that many of their wacky moments were less of a comic relief due to the above mentioned silliness but instead felt like the more serious moments in the movie.

vin diesel, well i watched this movie because i am a vin diesel fan so of course i liked him. he is his usual badass and kick ass self. he is also surrounded by a bunch of badass (and wacky as i mentioned before) characters. i quite liked the ensemble. the guy who seems to collect crashes is rather silly but fun in a strange way. i did like the gun girl a lot.

however, apart from quite a few fun and/or cool scenes the movie as a whole did not cut it. in my opinion it was ruined by a substandard script devoid of any form of intelligence. i would go as far as to say that the writers were incompetent pure and simple. i was almost giving it three stars because there was many parts i liked but in the end … no, there is no way i could justify more than two stars for this mess.

i don't always agree with (or heed warnings) from movie critics; perhaps because i used to be one myself in a nation wide magazine many years ago -- but if a movie has a 40% rating on metacritic, i admit it rarely bodes well. still i watched this, largely due to the involvement of several favorite actors and the script having been written by the duplass brothers.

i found it almost instantly both funny and moving, and the longer i watched, the more confused i became as to why most critics had been lukewarm or downright dismissive of it. i figured it had to be mostly due to the genre blend of comedy and more dramatic issues, and that probably most of the criticism had been along the usual lines of ""can't make up it's mind', etc. but even so, that didn't add up to a meager 40% rating, with such a clever script and great acting.

when the credits rolled, i knew instantly why: a happy ending...

it all mostly works out in the end for the oddball protagonists. critics in general can't stand it. if a movie has had a degree of realism and/or several dark or borderline dark-ish issues brought up along the way, critics tend to go ******* unless it all ends in misery, or largely unresolved, or at the very least in ambiguity. god forbid you walk away from such a movie actually feeling good; that equals 'cheesy' in most reviewers book. was it realistic that most of the people involved got a happy, somewhat romantic ending? of course not, but though the movie tackles several 'real' issues within the comedy, i found the ending perfectly fitting with the tone of it. critics often use the word 'predictable' about anything that has a hint of romantic comedy in it, but i'd say, there are few things as predictable as movie critics in general.

4969,"**when lifeguards turned homicides!**

in the 90s, when the original television series was aired, i was just a kid. then it was too sexy, that i was not allowed to watch. the world has changed so much all these years. i always wanted to see that, but never had a chance. now a film, possibly a new franchise if it all goes well. there were lots of expectations on it, but the film did not deliver that. yet they have already announced a sequel.

the bay security team is now recruiting new members. three joins as the trainee after the tryout. within a few days, a couple of suspicious deaths happen in the bay. the cops are not worried to solve it, but the baywatch team jumps in and starts their own investigation. that leads them to a dangerous territory. from there, how they deal with it was revealed with some action-thriller.

pumped up body, starring alongside a current top star, nothing is working for zac efron. he's just an accidental actor, won't survive long, unless he turns it all his way like ben afflect did. on the other hand, dwayne was awesome. all the other actors too. priyanka was not ideal for such role. because an indian in a negative role for an american film, nah, it does not work. india keeps all the thugs and sends only engineers, doctors, scientist et cetera to the foreign lands. a chinese or a russian villain works better.

no suspense. everything was open from the beginning itself. some of the comedies were good, but some were most absurd. especially, i did not like the storyline. the bay security force not doing their job, but police work. it goes completely out of the frame. it's okay doing same within their enclosure, but the film entered beyond that. thus, the film missed to cover the beach events as what the title had promised. i hope the sequel would fall in line.

4980,"**the anti-matrix**

when i saw the poster, i was expecting it to be a cheap matrix rip-off. i was so wrong; this is the anti-matrix. the similarity to the matrix are only superficial and very intentional and only to mock the matrix.

this becomes very obvious when we see that rooftop scene actually play out (it ends quite differently than it does in the matrix). why would i love a movie that mocks the matrix? i am not saying the matrix is a bad movie, but there is a more sinister aspect to it, that the makers of this movie picked up on and this movie is their response.

because if there is no ""reality"" and it's all just an illusion created by the ""architect"" the imprison us, then human life becomes cheap. because their lives are all just an illusion anyway and if they die, their souls might even wake up and become free of the matrix. or at least that's actually the conclusions some lunatics came to after having watched the matrix.

so in this movie we are faced with an autocratic system that's actually completely modeled after real life china with a similar view on human life - viewing average, everyday humans as similarly expendable. and to justify their state wide ""family planning"" they promise the ""superfluous"" siblings that they imprison a kinda matrix of their own where they put them into pods similar to the ones we see in the matrix and where they are then induced into a sleep state in which they dream and have a sort off life of their own, even if only in their heads. so it is a kinda matrix, except that at the end we of course find out that their matrix is... well... i don't want to give spoilers. you just have to watch it if you haven't seen it. it's a great movie with some superb acting.",high

4987,"click here for a video version of this review: https://youtu.be/v_pcaiq7ave

i’ve not read a lot of stephen king books, but one which i read and loved was _the gunslinger_ which is the first book in _the dark tower_ series. in 2017 a movie adaptation came out and was named after the series. starring idris elba and matthew mcconaughey it was hotly anticipated but was met with bad reviews on release. 

having loved _the gunslinger_ and hearing those reviews it’s taken me a long time to get around to watching this. having now seen it, i gotta say, i agree with those reviews. it’s not a trash movie, but it is also not even close to being a good movie. 

the core problem is that there are eight books of source material, and for some reason they try to distil all that lore and world building into one 95min film. for that reason alone it was doomed from the start, but add in hilariously uncharismatic acting, shoddy cgi, and a copy pasted plot from 100 other sci-fi or fantasy films, and you have a recipe for mediocrity. 

now i will say, i am not a fan of idris elba, but i actually thought he played the part of roland, the gunslinger, quite well. as for mcconaughey, all this did was confirm for me that he is one of the most overrated actors of our generation. 

my suggestion would be to avoid the movie and pick up the books, because the books will take you away on an epic journey much much more than this movie ever does.",low
4988,"i guess the studio execs decided the american public wasn't smart enough to get stephen king...you know, the godfather of accessible fiction.

seriously...

what in the wide, wide world of sports happened here?!!!!! honestly, it's a king movie, it doesn't need to be good. i mean look at the body of work that was made that people actually would agree were good: the dead zone, the green mile, stand by me, shawshank, carrie (1976), and the shining (arguably among fans).

6 movies...that's about it. the rest are mediocre, 1408, cat's eyes, misery, firestarter.

and the rest are low budget throw away films that can be enjoyed the same way that one can enjoy any b-movie...and that's fine. i have a feeling that king appreciates b-movies more than you'd think. at least that's what he wrote in ""on writing."" but this...what the heck is this? honestly, the dark tower series is one of my least favorite things that king has ever written...and i am a huge king fan...but even then, i didn't expect it to be this bad.

for starters, it's really not the dark tower. i mean, the characters are the same in name...but really in name only.

the gunslinger is chasing the man in black...and that is all the similarities we have.

you can't blame the actors on this one. you can't blame the source material either, they are at least readable.

what you have here is a film that was re-written over and over and over and over again with, what i am guessing, is massive studio interference.

the series is already a big part of pulp culture, it already has a huge following...but watching this you get the feeling that some important people didn't understand that and had it rewritten a thousand time to try to make a franchise out of it, rather than use the franchise already in place. only they wanted to make a franchise by putting the entire franchise into a single film.

in the end you can almost feel the different writers when you watch it. you can see where it was meant to go in one direction, then got taken in another, and then a third and a fourth until the actors were so confused they had no choice but to give up.

in the end, i got the impression that no one involved knew exactly what they were trying to make any longer.

really, we should be demanding an instant remake and a total refund. fans deserve no less.",low
4989,"**if we often think that a movie doesn't need to have sequels, this case is the opposite: this movie should have been thought of as the beginning of a franchise of several movies.**

as far as i could tell, after some reading, this work of cinema was based on a work by stephen king, composed of a long series of books. i'm sure the source material is good, king is one of the best and most ingenious fantastic writers of our time and his vast literary oeuvre has already made for surprising and remarkable films. what i question is the way this adaptation was made: what are eight books converted into a two-hour film? they probably only took advantage of a handful of characters and locations and threw everything else in the trash. works like these can only be adapted in the form of trilogies, tetralogies or, in the television market, as series. otherwise, the source material is not properly exploited in its richness.

regardless of these issues, the film is moderately good: it all starts when the young protagonist, haunted by visions he has, finds a portal to a world he does not know, the world of his visions, and finds a gunslinger who will help him. deep down, he already knows the essential: the universal balance is in danger because an evil sorcerer wants to bring down the grandiose dark tower which, at the center of all things, harmonizes this balance and cosmic energies. i am explaining it simply and in my own words. now the task of the two heroes is to prevent this from happening.

the best thing about this film is really the feeling of adventure, risk, the almost constant action and the way everything unfolds quickly, without dead moments. as an entertainment film, it is very good, and if we forget that it is the worst adaptation of king ever made for the cinema, we can really have a good time watching it. the big problem here is how rushed everything feels, with the film trying to do too much without having to reach its two and a half hour runtime.

the quality of the cast is another asset that makes the film work reasonably well. none of the actors are amazing, there are no great performances, but what was done is enough to push the film in the right direction: idris elba is charismatic and likable without ceasing to be fearsome, something his character demanded and which the actor knew to adapt. tom taylor also did a good job in the role of the young hero, a role where it would have been very easy to make mistakes, be superficial or ham. the villain has fallen into the shoes of matthew mcconaughey, and despite being suitably dark, he's not really a palpable threat.

technically, the film relies heavily on cgi and effects. the film called for that, given the plot and sci-fi theme. the cgi and effects are good and work well for the most part, although there are a number of options and solutions that i would consider debatable. for example, the film never explores – nor does it have time for – the connections between parallel universes, and how there are so many people in our world who know this. the film would have gained in quality if it had been given an additional hour, or if it had been thought of as the beginning of a broader franchise, with several sequels. the cinematography is very good, the filming work is average, it has good sets, good costumes and excellent action scenes. the soundtrack, i confess, is not convincing, but it works effectively, which is already positive.",low

4998,"**caught in the rebirth-loop!**

i might a bit overrated it, but it's well deserved that. it has been a long time since i wetted my eyes for a film. especially for being a tearjerker fan in the early days. this looks like a sequel to 'fluke', though it justified to be an independent film. based on the book of the same name, directed by the one who made 'hachi: a dog's tale'. a perfect family film, but entirely a fictional account.

do you remember those films about a human being trapped in the time- loop, not knowing why and takes a quest to find the purpose? yep, this is same, but with a dog and not a time-loop, instead, the rebirths. the tale was told from a dog's perspective, his life from puppy to growing old with his owners. the lives he enjoyed, struggled, loved, and not understanding why the life circle keeps repeating. after all the things film wanted to tell us, the story ends with an explanation. just a simple one.

the dog's the hero, he's found in every frame. the rest of the characters were well designed. especially the sub-stories to blend with the dog's. all the dogs who acted in the film were awesome. this is one of the best dog films. as i said, it is not great, but surely enjoyable by everyone. especially in the today's cgi dominated and/or superhero flicks, this is something close to our heart, despite a fantasy tale. so, go it!

5000,"this infamous flop is a pretty-to-look-at mess of confusion, tension, and some very good performances.  in norway, detective harry hole (michael fassbender) and his new bright-eyed partner katrine (rebeecca ferguson) are investigating a series of disappearances that have been going on for years, some centered around philanthropist arve stop (j.k. simmons).  a calling card, the titular snowman, is left at the crime scenes, and are the signature of some anonymous letters hole is starting to receive.  harry and katrine go through the motions, taking advantage of the police department's new piece of technical marvel equipment.  harry also involves himself in his former girlfriend rakel's (charlotte gainsbourg) life, and the couple seem to be pining for each other once again.

it's never a good sign when your film's director admits that he only had time to shoot 85% of a screenplay he was handed after being brought on when the original director, martin scorsese, dropped out.  there are a couple of scenes in the trailer that didn't make the cut of the film simply because there was nowhere to insert them in this incomprehensible story.  oscar winners claire simpson and thelma schoonmaker were credited as editors, but their expertise can't salvage this mess.  the film takes place in norway, with travels to bergen in germany, but all the performers speak english.  the setting and character names are scandinavian, try to stop laughing at the name ""harry hole,"" but the film makers oddly went with this cast instead of moving the setting to canada or alaska, or hiring a norwegian cast.

on the positive, and i don't know how, the cast is great.  fassbender is seen waking up from a drunken stupor a few too many times, but his performance is very good.  ferguson is okay, but gainsbourg turns her ex-girlfriend character into something special, and i wish we could have had more of her.  karlsson has her new boyfriend is achingly polite and naive, not quite picking up on the chemistry between harry and rakel.  aside from a few iffy special effects shots, the true locations are gorgeous, cold, and snowy.  based on a series of novels by jo nesbo (why start shooting with the seventh one?), this should have been a franchise starter, but the box office returns took care of that idea.  from what i have read online, the screenplay strays from the novel on key plot points and kills off a couple of major characters who would return in later novels.

5051,"i guess i am going to disagree both with the critics, wich of course is not at all unusual, as well as with a lot of the actual viewers of this movie by saying that i really liked this movie.

i guess that i can to some extent understand that some viewers are disappointed. that would be the viewers that have read the comics that the movie is based on. unfortunately someone in the production team decided to take bits and pieces from several comic books and mash them together as well as change some key elements. it is really annoying when that is done. it is usually an indication that somewhere some dumbass who did not understand, and certainly did not respect, the source material had way too much influence on the production. it is really a shame since the comic book from wich the core of the of the story seems to be taken is certainly more than good enough to stand on its own.

well luckily the mashup that they produced is actually bloody good. something wich in my experience is quite rare. the valerian comics lends themselves very well as a base for some spectacular sci-fi  with plenty of weird creatures and spectacular scenery. add luc besson to the mix and you have to spell spectacular in all caps.

this is definitely a luc besson movie. plenty of action, spectacular (yes i repeat myself but this movie deserves it) scenery, a fair amount of weirdness. in short a lot of stuff this particular viewer likes.

the mashed up story is not too bad. it is predictable as hell of course, even though it is not following the comics, but it is making a decent job of tying together all the action and fx and the action and fx is really the main reason to watch this movie after all.
i have to say that i think most of the characters were pretty okay. it seems that the performance of the two main characters where generally not so well received by a lot of people. i guess i can somewhat understand that but i still cannot refrain from saying: read the fucking comics! okay it is a french comic and there are probably few people outside of france (or at least outside of europe) that have read them. me being one of the few of course. anyway, valerian and laureline are supposed to be somewhat weird, silly and a little bit childish. personally i think they did a fair job of interpreting the comic book characters the way they should be. we probably have luc besson to thank for not getting a some hollywood, thirteen on a dozen, characters.

i do miss some bits of the real comics though. the transmutation animal played a much more visible role in the comic and so did the three information peddlers wich gave a much more professional impression in the comic book by the way. i also think it was a shame that they changed the story of the muh so much. their role in the comic book was much more impressive to me.

still, most of the bits and pieces that is taken from the different comic books and mashed together are quite faithfully reproduced, at least visually and the results turned out really really good as far as i am concerned.

the suit and inclusion of iron man takes away from what is great about spiderman. the fact he has to juggle school, work, realationships is what kept him grounded...
he does not need iron man's suit or him flying in to save the day!!

also, why does he not have a spidey-sense?!? he gets nailed left, right and centre!

5056,"i guess i should not be too surprised given the spider man character we saw in the latest captain america but i have to say that i was, well, hoping for something else, as in something better.

if the producer/writer intended to make a spider man movie for kids, and i mean kids, not young adults but kids, then this movie is hitting the spot. it is an excellent action/adventure movie for kids. unfortunately i am not really in that viewer segment and for me this movie was pretty bad.

the movie is childish. there is no other way to describe it. my memory of spider man is a quite serious young man with a sharp and witty tongue. not the fumbling and childish spider man in this movie. his best friend may be a good computer geek but otherwise he is dumb as a door nail and just tiring to watch. his, supposedly adult handler is a screw up who, surprise surprise, is hanging up the phone because he cannot be bothered to listen to kids.

the fx may be good as fx goes visually but it was also the typical, nonsensical hollywood rubbish like boats that stays afloat forever despite being split in half etc. etc. the talking spider man suit appears to be programmed by the same guy who wrote the childish script.

the main bad guy pretty much has zero charisma and is nothing but a simple thief. same goes for his buddies.

the sjw crap spread out here and there in the movie, especially in the washington monument scenes, was unwanted and just pissed me off.

i am afraid that this movie missed its mark for me by a wide margin. i do not understand why it seems to be so bloody difficult for hollywood to make a good spider man movie. i like spider man, the comics character that is, so i find the slew of substandard movies really disappointing.

the only reason it doesn't get less than two out of three stars from me is because, as a kids movie, it is not at all bad (except for the sjw crap). it wasn't what i was looking for though.",low
5058,"after the failure that was 'the amazing spider-man 2' sony made a drastic decision in lending the character back to marvel, and did it pay off? absolutely!

unlike the sam raimi trilogy where toby maguire was a better peter parker than spider-man and the mark webb duology where andrew garfield was a better spider-man than a peter, tom holland encapsulates both characters perfectly.
of course there were a negatives, especially in the second act which drops off a bit but the movies does such a wonderful job of recapturing our attention that you just can't help but forgive the movie for it!",high

5065,"i won't complain about the continuity error within the mcu...because no one really cares least of all myself.

well, how do we do this. i mean, it is refreshing that garfield is gone and with him the spider-bully. for marvel comics fans, it really hurt watching garfield bully and taunt his victims.

now we have a spidey that is, well, nice. holland is able to be funny and wise-cracking without seeming like a, well, a flash thompson. with that it beings us back to the source material.

in other words holland puts the ""friendly"" back in ""your friendly neighborhood spider-man."" and i think the mcu was well aware of this, given the time they took to make sure everyone knew holland was going to be the hero that everyone loves.

and then keaton does a great vulture from his origin to his demise he seemed to do everything he could to really become the character.

my only complaints were the supporting cast. aunt may i can accept with a moderate grudge because she is a great actress...

but tony revolori doesn't seem....built enough to be flash. he's more the bully of the millennial generation that uses words and little more and...when it comes down to it, even those are vapid.

what's that old adage, ""sticks and stones will break my bones but words will never harm me."" millennials i guess have never heard that.

flash is supposed to be that big bully jock that hits his prime in high school and, a decade later, delivers the pizza when you go home to visit your folks...this flash has a future.

and the mj tease at the end...it went a little too far away from the character in looks and personality to sit well.

still, on the whole the movie is a breath of fresh air in its distance from garfield's rendition and at times, holland was even able to pull off almost a james bond quality while still portraying a kid over his head.

like all mcu movies, however, the pay off is the humor.",high

5076,"i had a few reservations going in to _alien: covenant_. in my opinion there hasn't been a truly great entry to the franchise since _aliens_, so i was worried that the statistics were against it. i thought _prometheus_ was incredible from a technical standpoint, but not a very engaging movie, and i was worried we might get the same here. the trailers had been mostly good but i was worried i had seen too much of the third act in them, and i was worried this would spoil the experience for me a little.

what i was not worried about was within ten minutes of the damn thing starting i would think to myself: ""wow, this movie is really poorly made.""

well i guess i'm an idiot because that is exactly what happened. and that feeling never entirely abated over the course of the whole thing.

i had wondered why some folk considered the first three ""alien"" movies canon and not the current set.

david, obsessed with the act of creation that had value in its end, uses any means available. it is remarkable that no one from the remaining crew has questioned imposter walters’s identity and just carried on like the worst was left behind. meanwhile, the last scene when daniels (katherine waterston) realizes (finally!) that walter is, in fact, david and she had totally screwed up with the thousands of colonizers and embryos on the ship… does give you slight goosebumps.",high

i loved ""prometheus"" with its attempt at something bigger than just more face huggers and xenomorphs wreaking havoc. it was clear he was building a grander story to the eventual bridge to the original ""alien.""   

he continues that bigger story with ""alien: covenant"" and whether he meant to provide fan service or not, we get that with face huggers and xenomorphs. (no spoiler as both are in the trailers.) 

do yourself a favor and watch the short clip ""last supper"" (youtu.be/ekxgrlrao5i ) before you watch the movie. at only five minutes, it gives a better introduction of the covenant crew than the movie does providing deeper emotional investment in these characters.  

ultimately ""alien covenant"" delivers an excellent, fast-paced sci-fi action horror thriller (yes, it hits that many genres) like only ridley scott can that continues exploring the ""prometheus"" theme of creation.",high

it's still putting on airs. it's still living under the delusion that it's something closer to ""chinatown"" than, well, a monster movie in space.

i don't want to see an alien movie that thinks its ""raging bull."" it doesn't really work that way. i want to see and alien movie that knows its an alien movie.

now before i begin to tear this film into shreds, let me give you some background. i was excited for this movie. i love tom cruise. i love sofia boutella. i love russell crowe. i love the universal monsters. 

lets just say i was disappointed.

this film has some of the worst tonal problems in a film ever. an inconsistent tone is my biggest pet peeve. sometimes it's scary. sometimes it's a huge action blockbuster. sometimes it's trying to be like brendan frasier's ""the mummy."" it doesn't know what it is.

the female lead (who's name i can't remember) is incredibly bland. not her acting, she's actually quite good. it's the writing is what makes her bad. 

jake johnson's character is one of the most annoying characters in a movie ever. and i mean that. i hated almost every scene he was in.

the few high notes: sofia boutella kills it. russell crowe is delightfully campy. tom cruise gives another solid performance despite his character being super unlikable.

alex kurtzman is what hurts this film. the direction is quite bland. kurtzman is a bad screenwriter and a just as bad director.

this film is a mess. tonal problems and bland writing. some fun action scenes and performances can't keep this film from being a boring trainwreck.

1.3/5.0",low

5104,"**beautiful, colourful and sweet**

this film has real heart, with great messages about what family can and should do for each other.  great voice acting, great songs without having the burden of exposition via song that you find in the more musical ventures by disney.  i loved that you could see genuine guitar chords being played, so often in live action films the playing of musical instruments, especially guitar are poorly faked.  none of that in this animated gem.

one thing i personally loved was the depiction of mexican culture.  although i really enjoyed _moana_, i thought it was a little bit too much of a pastiche of multiple pacific cultures when it should have just picked one (maori) and stuck with it.  _coco_ celebrates mexican culture, and depicts it well.  the only thing missing for me was more mexican cuisine.

it can get a little dark in places, so maybe be careful when watching it with the little ones, but should appeal to most of the family.

the whole 105 minutes are a joy to watch, thanks to its rich and highly meaningful story alongside the wonderful animation and sharp humour. safe to say, i was not expecting this film to smash it out the park - which it totally does. this is why i don't, personally, look up about films before watching them, i love being surprised.

big credit also goes to the cast, who play some awesome characters. from miguel (anthony gonzalez) to héctor (gael garcía bernal) to ernesto (benjamin bratt), among others, they are all very, very good.

it isn't just the characters that make this memorable, it is also the excellent plot which is told beautifully. it's filled with not just comedy but also a load of heart - there's a few nicely done twists too. the world that they create around the day of the dead is fantastic, while the music fits perfectly.

5110,"this is a good solid cold war spy story with plenty of action. i have to say that i liked this movie a lot.

i expected a fairly shallow over the top action flick with a sexy but not very bright kick-ass chick as the main protagonist. to my surprise i got something quite a bit more than that. sure the movie is quite “hollywoodish”, it is supposed to be a action movie after all, but it is surprisingly well done and charlize theron is great as the sexy, not at all stupid and very much kick-ass chick.

as a bit of a twist the story is told in the form of a debriefing at the mi6 headquarter. this type of storytelling can be a bit miss or hit since, unless the writer is good at it, it has a tendency to spoil the movie and the events already when the movie starts. i would say that in this one they got it right.

the movie is frequently quite dark and gritty which of course is fitting with the former east germany setting. to my great delight they did not stoop to the usual dark, almost black and white, boring type of footage that you too frequently get. instead the dark and gritty scenes are filmed in a “darkish” blue hue and the scenes actually have a lot of color in them.

the story is a fairly standard spy-is-given-a-mission-behind-the-wall-and-it-all-goes-to-hell one. as a story goes it is really not much to write home about and it has the usual plot holes and illogical twists. what makes this movie good is how it is implemented.

as i have already mentioned charlize theron is great in her role. she is sharp tongued, hot and kicks ass. unlike many protagonists in movies like this one she not only administers pain but she receives it as well. actually the movie starts with scenes of her showing off bruises all over her body (yes all of it).

to fill out the picture we get some brutal, and i mean brutal, kgb agents, the traitorous colleague, the defector and a few other characters. together they embark on a roller coaster ride of spy work, chases, (brutal) ass kicking etc. all of it very well done as far as i am concerned. it is not the silly fx loaded blow-everything-up kind of action but instead up-personal-beat-them-up action.

i have to say that i quite liked the end of the movie as well. the twist at the end was maybe not the biggest surprise of the year but i definitely liked it. i really do not like movies that fizzles out with a bunch of loose ends and objectives not achieved. this movie is, to my great enjoyment, not one of those.

to me this movie was really good. certainly better than i expected.",high
5113,"it should have been good. it is a spy movie with a basic spy movie plot. it promises double crosses and intrigue.

but it never really delivers on the suspense and tension that are the principle trope of good spy movies...and it never really delivers on the empty mindless popcorn stuffing atmosphere that are the basic tropes of action movies.

so in the end you're left with a movie that isn't tense and suspenseful enough to be ""3 days of the condor"" or ""the americans"" and a movie that isn't as mindless action packed fun as james bond.

all the elements were there, but they never seemed to pull them off. it's like that old native american saying, ""if you chase two rabbits you'll lose them both."" and that's really what happened here. it tried to be two different kinds of spy movie in one and never really made it into either.

you're left wondering why you bothered. had they picked one and went whole headlong for that goal, it could have been stellar. instead it's luke warm at best.",low

5116,"my oldest son, as well as myself of course, wanted to watch this movie already before christmas when it went up geneva but it was pretty much sold out (unless you wanted to sit at the very edge of the theatre). i manage to book tickets for yesterday though so…here’s my ramblings about the movie.

as usual with these kind of movies, where there is a large following of fans, there is also many dissenting voices. some people apparently are going as far as to want this movie to be undone. well, my take on that is that these people need to grow up or let go or both. luke is no longer a young farm boy running around saving the universe. the star wars universe and its characters are evolving and that is the way it should be and the way it is. time for the next generation to pick up the torch.
both me and my son really liked this movie. after the abysmal episodes i to iii (jar jar binks still haunts me in my dreams) i have really enjoyed the star wars movies.

i quite liked the force awakens but it is true that it felt a bit like a rehash of a new hope. not only does this one not feel like it is reusing old material (too much) but it also feels like it is opening a new chapter in the star wars universe.
the fx is as good as you have the right to expect from a star wars movie. the story is fresh and well developed. it will not win any oscars of course but i liked it. it makes things evolve while at the same time giving enough room for action and a wee bit of humor.

the characters are almost all good and well played. i am looking forward to seeing more of most of them, especially, rey and poe. i’m not 100% convinced about finn and rose but i can live with them.  kylo ren do not yet fill up the shoes of darth vader but he is showing promise. contrary to snoke i do feel he should put on a mask though.

the two characters i did not really like was general hux and dj. the first one was just incompetent. i’m not sure if he was supposed to be a bit of comical relief or not but, as far as i am concerned, we can do without him. dj, well i guess he was supposed to not be liked so he did a good job of that but these kinds of assholes just frustrate me to no end. we never saw him actually meet his demise in this movie so if he is brought back i hope it will be for the sole purpose of rectifying that oversight…as violently and painfully as possible.

of course, we saw a few new ships as well and as usual with the empire bigger is better…or maybe not. not sure what to say about these new designs. at least they did not look like a enlarged (except for the bridge) star destroyer like darth vader’s super star destroyer.

one thing that really bugged me in the first battle though was the rebels’ so called “bombers”. what kind of bloody moron designed those? they were just so wrong in so many ways. the design itself was just silly looking. they were slower than a flee on a patch of tar. seriously, a space bomber that crawls along? actually, why make a “bomber” in space at all? that brings us to the biggest gripe of them all with this ludicrous design…dropping bombs vertically? in space? how the fuck do they fall?

sure they looked somewhat cool when they dropped their bombs…if your knowledge of physics is on the level of your average politician (and obviously a few hollywood employees as well).

anyway, on the whole me and my son had two and a half hours of great fun watching the last jedi. i hope the next movie expands on the threads this one started. i have to say that i was a bit sorry about the feeble state of the resistance at the end, so i do hope the next writer will not let this drag on. one way to ruin star wars for me would be to turn star wars into some battlestar galactica variant with resistance survivors on constant run from the empire. now it is time for the resistance to strike back, and for rey to evolve her jedi powers.",high

these later films have been a mixed bag.  most were watchable enough, though not really the caliber of the old films  sure, the effects are great, but a good movie needs more than special effects and cool alien makeup and some fun droids.

this movie was seriously disappointing.  everything about familiar characters was changed, and the plot was so busy with pushing some weird agenda that it failed to deliver any of what we go to a star wars movie to see.  at this stage, i couldn't care less about the newer characters, and the whole ""mary sue"" aspect to the one main girl (see, i can't even recall her name!) is just annoying.  this film w bad enough that the dedicated sw fanboy in my household just quit watching, and actualy, for the first time ever, skipped the following movie entirely.

daisy ridley and john boyega do their thing and are enjoyable once again, ridley particularly impressed me. i also like adam driver in this, while it's always pleasing to see mark hamill and carrie fisher involved. as for newcomers, benicio del toro and kelly marie tran stand out.

there are also some incredible shots, the entire sequence at the end thrilled me - there's a particular part involving laura dern (even if her character, overall, isn't all that good) that looks utterly superb.

5128,"some of the praise, at least from the fans is because of the deviation from star wars tradition which, honestly, i have an issue with out the door. we are watching it because we want to see a star wars film.

and the deviation from star wars tradition seems especially ridiculous given how hard it tries--like the force awakens--to rely on nostalgia to keep the fans that felt alienated when rey turned out to be, well, absolutely flawless, absolutely loved and trusted by absolutely everyone, and faced no real challenges or struggles...

...so, bank on nostalgia because giving the primary character a real literary struggle to add to a sense of character and plot is still seemingly out of the question.

and that kind of seems like a troupe now days of characters that are diverse for the state of diversity. it seems like their creator and political fans feel that adding any struggle for said character to overcome would somehow take away from the political importance of the character.

and that holds true for the last jedi. rey still has no real struggles that can create even the slightest bit of dramatic tension for the audience. it is understood that she is the best and can easily overcome anything the story throws at her...and she does.

and that is the reason her character is rejected by fans. it doesn't make for good cinema. skywalker had the same issues in i-iii, but at least it was understood that he was going to fail at the end of his story arc only to be redeemed in luke's.

rey is still so perfect there is no dramatic tension where she is involved.

but, don't let that be the only thing that kills it for you. poe's initial radio play with the new faux empire sets the entire movie up for one long eye roll. those jokes seemed so out of place for science-fiction that it killed the movie from the start.

but then the bad humor of your lame aunt that only think's she's funny is also a new troupe for movies for movies like this.

so the films have to rely on nostalgia to market it to fans of the last two trilogies...and in this case it doesn't really work. the nostalgia is more along the lines of ""remember when luke skywalker was a thing"" variety. the sort of nostalgia that references the old beloved franchise, without really understanding the dynamic of it.

they did the same ""remember when this happened"" nostalgic ploy in the force awakens and, like then they didn't have the background and understanding to pull it off. solo wasn't really the cynical untrusting scoundrel that made him so beloved. and in this one luke isn't the whiny flawed but blindly moral hero that gets in over his head.

the result is a nostalgia that is just an empty reference. a nostalgia that has no real idea what it is referencing, or at least not one that runs any deeper than the surface.

so the jokes don't land. so hero doesn't struggle and... ...the film has no real drama because of the lack of struggle. so the nostalgia is only skin deep and... ...it results in a nostalgia that is more of an insult to the older fan base that it tries to appeal to.

disney didn't listen to the fans that complained about the force awakens. they were too busy calling them names for not loving the film. all the fans wanted was a story, that is all, they wanted a struggle, they wanted real drama. they wanted the characters they loved to be the characters they loved.

what they got instead was a character easily walks into every situation and beats every adversity with ease still...despite that being the main complaint.

what they got was old heroes acting like different people again.

and, i really want to avoid any hints towards the plot as....it might kill a lot of the humor for those that haven't seen it. so excuse the vagueness, but after watching it, you might see where its necessary from an entertainment not a twist standpoint.

so...the bad: it is not ""porno"" which breaks the heart because, well, ""porno"" was absolutely hysterical, right down to why it had its title.

that being said, the draw is the cast. trainspotting was one of those ""how the hell did they make this book into a coherent movie"" movies and in many aspects ""porno"" would have been easier, but would certainly still fit into that mold. so it's likely better that t2 didn't follow the book.

anyway, the joy is just seeing the crew back together again, the chemistry is still there, it's totally an ensemble cast and that was really the principal draw to the first film as well.

i don't want to give away the plot, but the cast just works so well together, they know their characters and live them. and the characters are delightful to watch.

i sort of feel that they could have thrown any script at them, and so long as the cast and characters stayed the same...the film would have been thoroughly entertaining.

it doesn't hit as hard as the first film, but everyone has aged and it's still....brilliant.

really, you're watching it for the cast and characters, and it pays off in sheer entertainment.",high

5142,"**if forgiving is that easily convincible, then welcome to the crime world!**

a novel based film. a religious themed film. it has a message, but could be a bad message for today's world. because how the event was dealt with the story only encourages the crime, in reality. wise people can say philosophically, morally, but not means every words practically applicable. the common people would get affected more. other than that, i have no grudge on anything. if it has been just a fantasy and an entertaining film, excluding that christian thing, i would have liked it better.

it was more like another 'what dreams may come', but less visual spectacular. on the other hand, there was an uneasiness in the development of what happened in the early stage of the story. they did not go for the detail, from the crime perspective, hence that mysterious event holds the key which we don't know exactly what happened to judge anything out of the film. so that part reminds 'the lovely bones'.

the story of a father whose little girl mysteriously disappeared on a camping trip. now the struggling father to cope with the incident gets an invitation to meet the creators. his journey to the other side of the world, where he goes through a series of unexpected tests, and at the end, how his character changes are told in those remaining parts.

worthington, spencer, everybody was good. but the story is what i did not like. like it was aimed for christians only. but i believe not every christian would agree with this story. i felt it was an unnecessary film. if it was fun like 'bruce almighty', the whole world would have enjoyed it. too serious and very not acceptable message led this film to fall. no, it is not worth a watch for people with the open mind, unless this is what you were looking for.

5143,"**missed opportunity**
(review is spoilerish)

coming on the heels of last summer's surprise success _the shallows_, comes this summer's laughable attempt to portray shark behavior. while shark movies since _jaws_ have been scientifically inaccurate, you have to throw a movie like _jaws_ a bone because, well, it's _jaws_. it was a wonderfully made film, released at a time when we knew little to nothing about the nature of great white sharks. after 30 years of documentaries and shark week, the cinematic shark is still a mindless villain whose soul reason for existing is to move the plot forward, and eat it when it cannot.

i'd like to say what _47 meters down_ lacks in accuracy it makes up for in plot, suspense, and characters. but that's just not true. the script seemed to be a first draft, full of plot holes and non-existent characterization. it was a typical tell-not-show movie, where characters, through dialogue, literally explained themselves to the audience, rather than establish themselves through action.

the film opens with a pretentious and symbolic shot of a spilled drink to mimic blood in the water, i guess, in case, you didn't know this was a shark movie? we narrow our focus to two american sisters vacationing in mexico. later in the movie, when the script necessitates it, the younger sister, kate, is portrayed as athletic, heroic, courageous, and endowed with other noble attributes. we learn this not through 20 minutes of established characterization, but through the older sister, lisa, lamenting about how she is the shy, boring one, while kate is more adventurous and outgoing. 

instead, the first 20 minutes of the film establishes kate as nothing more than a party girl--making out with strange men, doing tequila shooters, dancing on the beach. we find out that kate is kind of awesome, but only because lisa, virtually, says to the audience, ""my sister is awesome."" but in the 20 minutes of exposition we get on the sisters, all we really have to work with is what amounts to a music video--quick shots of drinking and dancing.

lisa's characterization--while presented in the amateur way of awkward dialogue (hey, ""sis""--in case you didn't get that they were sisters--i'm here because of this terrible thing that's going on with my boyfriend, and that's my motivation for the next 90 minutes)--is at least presented to us. however, in tripe ripped from the most unromantic and unfunny of romantic comedies, lisa's every action--including, apparently, kissing another man--is to impress some guy back in the states who has already left her. you know, because a woman's self worth and sense of identity is tied directly to a man (insert eye roll here).

now the movie becomes a movie. the sisters head out to sea to go shark diving, encountering a captain who goes back and forth between paternally concerned and grossly negligent, and a mate who is, for all intents a purposes, a total dick for reasons never explained.

after we've established that lisa has never dove (dived?) before, and that captain taylor is perfectly fine with that (the equivalent of taking someone who's never driven before and entrust them with a semi on our highways), and that shark cage and winch system is faulty--essentially telegraphing everything that is going to go wrong--the girls get in the water, see some sharks swimming around and then, plummet to the bottom, 47 meters down.

the film becomes both engaging and obnoxious at this point. the sharks are out there, lurking in the darkness, popping up for scares here and there to jolt the audience. at that point it becomes like a monster movie--a haunted house type movie, with our two protagonists trapped in a metaphorical basement. that's all well and dandy, as are the scenes of pure suffocating terror. there's an almost psychological horror element in some scenes, with lisa so disoriented in the darkness, she doesn't know which way to swim to reach safety. 

however, the situational suspense wears thin quickly. rather than using atmospheric suspense, the filmmakers relied on suspense through situations where everything goes wrong. constantly. putting on another tank of air takes 20 minutes. i was never sitting there saying, ""oh my god, how are they going to get out of this situation!?"" i was going, ""oh my god, how long is the director going to milk this scene for!?"" i wasn't in suspense; i was frustrated. 

finally, we have an ending that could have--should have--saved the whole movie. it's hard to go into specifics without giving away major spoilers to a kind m. night shamaylanesque ""twist ending"" so you may want to stop reading now, though i intend to be as vague as possible.

okay, what works with the ending...

it provides a nice twist that i didn't see coming. i thought it was very clever.

what didn't work? well, unless you have some familiarity with diving at certain depths, it might seem as if it's coming out of left field. i understood what was happening, so i understood the ending. but for the uninformed, it might be confusing--and that confusion would ruin the impact. there simply wasn't proper information given to the audience to decipher the ending for themselves unless they familiar with things such as the so-called ""rapture-of-the-deep.""

but where the ending really shot itself in the foot was the denouement that follows and ties everything up in a nice, safe, hollywood ending. basically, if the movie had ended two minutes sooner, with the camera slowing pulling back from a girl trapped in a shark cage, the rest of the movie's sins could have been over looked.

one of the drawbacks though is the same that plagued blair witch project: the ending _is_ the movie. but the first 80 minutes are not strong enough to get you to the final ten more than once or twice. i'll probably never see this film again. despite that, i didn't despise it. i'm not going to sit here and tell you that it was the worst $11 i've ever spent or that i want the last two hours of my life back. it accomplished what it set out to do in the most shallowest of terms, and i'm good.

despite it's many flaws, i was pleased with mandy moore's performance as lisa. she seemed to be the only actor who was consistent in relying--through action, dialogue, demeanor and tone--exactly who her character was. also, the film stayed away from the gratuitous t&a shots that plagued similar films like last year's _the shallows_ (was bake lively's butt never _not_ in frame?) 2005's _into the blue_ that seemed to focus more on paul walker's abs and jessica alba's curves than the actual plot itself, and 1977's _the deep_, best known for two hours of jacqueline bissett in a wet t-shirt.",low

5153,"there may be some fine performances in this movie, but i honestly think the critics overrated this latest entry in the x-men saga. the performances of wolverine and prof. x by hugh jackman and patrick stewart are extraordinary. they create a believable and loving father-son bond between their characters, with logan caring for the ninety year old leader of the x-men after a horrible event occurs at the xavier school the year before. stephen merchant takes over the role of caliban from tómas lemarquis, who played the character in x-men apocalypse, and transforms him into an ally to logan and charlies. merchant is quite good in the role. but what really dragged down the movie is its nihilism. the other x-men are completely missing from the film and mutants have been wiped out almost completely. a sense of doom and hopelessness looms over the film. this movie completely upends the warm and hopeful epilogue of days of future past, where the x-men were restored to life and glory and mutants weren't extinct after all. death seems to stalk logan and charles wherever they go. there is also a conspicuous lack of significant female characters in this movie, too. the only female of note is laura/ x-23, and she spends most of the film mute. there is also a complete lack of any strong or memorable villains. no one ever reaches the level of greatness like other x-men villains such as magneto or william stryker. so, despite some good performances, this film is a bit overrated and also a little too bleak and depressing for my taste.",low
5158,"i believe that i am about to disagree with quite a few people now. you see, i did not like this movie.

not that this came as much of a surprise to me. what i got was pretty much what i expected. from a technical point of view the movie is quite well done. hugh jackman and patrick stewart are doing good jobs as always. the action scenes are good. the cinematography is not at all bad. if you are into tragic drama and do not mind the super hero twist of the movie then this is a movie for you. the technical qualities is why this movie gets any stars at all from me. if i would judge it by story only then it would have gotten zero, null, nada, nicths, rien, ingenting.

for me it was depressing, boring and not at all fun to watch. the only reason i watched it is because i, as a x-men fan, simply had to watch it as well as having it in my collection but i would have been happier it this movie had never been made.

wolverine is more or less an unpleasant drinking bum clad in filthy ragged clothes. professor x is half insane and apparently dangerous to himself and the people around him. we get absolutely no explanation as to how this sad state of affairs.

the entire movie is dark in spirit with the x-men all but died out and wolverine and professor x just waiting to die. then in comes this female child who later turns out to be a female version of wolverine. she pretty much lacks any form of charisma and she and wolverine spends almost the entire time in a state of conflict, much due to wolverine who seems to think everyone should go fuck themselves so that he can continue to self destruct.

the bad guys are the usual evil corporation doing experiments on x-men, genetics etc. supposedly they were behind the almost extermination of x-men but of course they keep their own little army of “enhanced” humans that doggedly harasses wolverine & co. there are some nice action sequences but there is really no good overall boss. no one with enough charisma to take the role of the main adversary unless you count x-24 who only took part in a few parts of the movie.

by the way, why the fuck do wolverine, laura as well as x-24 have to grunt like horny monkeys when they fight?

the story is rather predictable with no major surprises, little depth and low on logic. a typical hollywood drama. not really anything to write home about.

the movie is just so depressing from start to finish. as a last farewell to wolverine and professor x it is almost insulting. i know a lot of people seem to like it but i cannot understand why. at least not if you are a x-men fan.",low
5159,"the last cut is the deepest!

did we need another x-men movie? in fact did we need another wolverine movie? well the result is there for all to see, with logan not only showing itself to be undoubtedly the best wolverine venture by far, but arguably the best x-men picture as well. if, as expected (and surely to god it's hoped so), this is the last we see of the grumpy metal clawed superhero, then what a fitting and triumphant bow out it is.

james mangold, the director, has managed to create an adult superhero movie without it really being a superhero pic, for he has created a film noir western that happens to be about a superhero. mangold's love of noir and westerns bursts from the screen, which for those who follow those wonderful stands of cinema, will come as no surprise having seen with notice his copland and 3:10 to yuma redux. there's a perpetual grimness to the narrative that belies the quite often stunning surrounding locales, heavy themes such as men out of time - with destinies written (cue a deft comic book movie within a comic book chunk of metaphysics) - surrogates, mental illness, human ignorance, and on it goes, the narrative strong on intelligence as much as it is in wrought emotion. western fans will also be buoyed by the part that the 1953 classic western shane has to play in things, considerably so as its importance narratively, orally and visually is mightily strong.

logan's run!

ah yes, well being ""adult"" is all well and good, but is logan thrilling? do we get pumped up wolverine action, blood brains, splatter and mucho muscle flexing and pained roars of anger? oh yes! action from the off is never far away, and wonderfully staged and choreographed it is. lots of memorable set-pieces, while also some cleverly constructed sequences such as xavier's mind seizures hold court and enthral. yet the kicker with all that is we are clued in to the emotional baggage that the side-burn sporting protag carries with him. with each fight we sense the bigger picture, even as we watch in awe the emergence of laura (ironic film noir name right there as it happens) - and her part in this very ""human"" story - the thrills and spills are propelled by a meaningful but battered heart.

tech credits are superb. acting honours go to jackman, who after giving 17 years of his life to the character, gives it his all and this multi faceted performance, in a perfect world, deserves oscar recognition. patrick stewart, also, is immense, playing the nonagenarian charles xavier with such class, gracefulness and storming emotion that one can only admire. film debutante dafne keen as laura is utterly engrossing, quite a debut indeed, whilst stephen merchant as albino mutant tracker caliban is effective to the point we hanker for more. although the villains fronted by boyd holbrook (rote henchman leader) and richard e. grant (smarmy scientist git) just about pass muster, there's nothing to damage the piece. cinematography (john mathieson) is ""a"" grade, the filters set on neo-noir, with the splendid film noir black and white version a fillip for the heart of noir lovers. all that is left is for the sound mix to boom and the director to steer with heart, brain and soul, without doubt both come up trumps.

5170,"i am a great fan of agatha christie in general and hercule poirot in particular. when yet another remake of murder on the orient express came out i was somewhat hesitant. after all, the one with david suchet was perfect.

i guess i was right to be hesitant. this is another one of those remakes where you just wonder…why? as a movie it is not too bad but as a hercule poirot movie, the classical murder on the orient express no less, it is like buying a piece of prime filet of beef and discovering that the butcher gave you chicken drums when you open the package. edible but not at all what you paid for.

to me this movie was a blatant attempt to make an americanized version of hercule poirot. it was poorly done by a clueless scriptwriter and director and it was deeply disrespectful to the original character.

the movie starts of by introducing hercule as the pedantic, somewhat weird, person that he is but the attempt is just dumb and silly. apart from the scene more or less making hercule look like a jerk, these people apparently know him, why would they serve two eggs of different sizes in the first place? oh right, because the director thought the audience was too dumb to make that reflection.

then there are some things that hercule simply do not do. like walking on the roofs of train cars, climbing around and chasing criminals as if he was some action hero. he even gets shot and more or less just shrugs it off for christ sake!

and do not get me started on that grotesque moustache! as i said, an americanized version of hercule poirot. unfortunately bigger is not always better.

i can go on for some time here so let’s move on.

technically the movie is not that bad. the scenes, the decor, the acting in general etc. can even be said to be good. unfortunately, for me, this was constantly overshadowed by the brutal slaughtering of my beloved hercule poirot character.

part of this is probably due to the movie trying to focus so much on hercule that most of the other actors almost feel like … props, even though they themselves are doing quite a good job of their roles. one reviewer wrote that “the actors seem to have been invited, not to play characters, but to watch kenneth branagh act.” and there seems to be some truth in that.

the movie ends with a hint of further moves. personally, i hope there will not be a continuation of this train wreck (pun intended).",low
5172,"beginning with kenneth branagh's second decade as a filmmaker, i suggest he became an industry workhorse. he acted in many films and directed several, all with varying results in quality. most pointedly, few felt like they were personal projects for 15 years.  for example, his direction of **thor** is at the pleasure of kevin feige, the head of marvel films. i argue that **murder on the orient express is personal**. i believe that the ""shakespeare"" guy believed he could create the ""agatha christie"" equivalent of the marvel universe. as of this writing, he has returned a second film, **death on the nile**.  there are at least 30 more hercule poirot novels remaining for potential sequels.  likely, we won't see a third unless the second proves to be successful.

_orient express_ received a lukewarm reception - a tepid selection of both audience and critics who find the film neither superior or horrible.  but i am committed.  i find this classic story delivered through modern technology is beautiful, fun and entertaining. it remains quaint and intimate even as computer generated matte paintings create the stunning atmospheric vistas.  i even find the film quite open to repeated viewings.

the beautiful color and imagery is supported by a score by branagh's friend and musical voice, patrick doyle. the two feed off each other - doyle's assertive and aggressive compositions uniquely mimic branagh's earnest storytelling.  in other words, it is rarely quiet.

starting with **much ado about nothing**, branagh does a lot of stunt casting. this time may just take the cake.  every performer is an a-player and each is given at least one scene to chew a bit of the scenery. make no mistake about it, this story is a tour de force for the role of hercule poirot. branagh's performance of the belgian super-sleuth is quite fun, beginning on one of the greatest character introductions in the decade.

if critical and box office is a good reflection, its a fifty fifty shot whether you will enjoy branagh's **murder on the orient express**.  to be fair, most of the negative reviews i see are written by someone who is comparing this film to the 1974 star-studded telling.  those would rather you look up that version (where you will likely not know many of that _star studded_ cast)",high
5176,"on this movie i have to get a couple of things out of the way straight away.

first, the movie title and the blurb is hyperbole that has little to do with actual events in the movie. this is not some great war but just some silly little three way skirmish between some apes and two human factions.

second, the story for this movie is clearly written by someone who has an agenda and that agenda includes preaching how bad the white man is.
not surprisingly the result is bland, boring, frustrating and not very entertaining. 

i thought dawn of the planet of the apes was mildly entertaining. mostly due to the special effects. i thought rise of the planet of the apes was okay. again due to the special effects and because it had a fair amount of action. war for the planet of the apes do have decent special effects but nothing else. add the obvious political agenda and the movie goes straight into a nose dive.

the humans in the movie are stereotypical bad people and the apes are victims whether they are actually good apes or just asshole apes. there’s some decent action in the beginning and some at the end. in between we are “treated” to a slew of emotional scenes (or at least i suppose that’s what they were supposed to be) were ceasars grief and the evil of man are force fed down our throats.

not surprisingly the movie ends, which it of course do not do until all humans in sight are killed off for no good reason, with the apes finding their little part of heaven all shown in warm and rosy colors. close curtain…thank good!

i received a rather played out the first half with one of the slowest pacings i've seen this year. i'm a fan of films taking their time and carefully detailing everything, but those are films with a sense of purpose. this is not one of those films. it's a redbox on a bad movie night, or a film your girlfriend wants you to watch with her. neither situations are true for me, but i'm sure it's happened to someone before. it's a slow first half that just has this lackluster eruption becoming a parody of itself. the last fifteen minutes of this film become a ridiculous set of scenes of 2017.

if you're someone who has seen the trailer then you know what is going to happen. it practically lays out its entire structure hoping maybe you'll see it one late night. i saw it and got about what i expected.

rosario dawson plays as this blogger journalist type who has a beautiful family, the catch is that it was once katherin hegel's and she's not over the divorce. she begins to find ways to slowly destroy dawson's life hoping to win the love of her husband. you see that sound like it could be ok, but the writing and execution of the plot is just so convoluted and unbelievable that it just becomes a parody. i mean it isn't a slow build up at all, we are just shown that hegel is crazy playing all of its cards in the first fifteen minutes. it's just screaming to you saying ""you know what you got yourself into, enjoy the last hour and fifteen minutes,"".

even if you followed the public iran-contra scandal, you may be unfamiliar with the story of seal, who started running guns for the cia years before the familiar public scandal erupted. american made is a fast, breezy, amoral look at the ins and outs of a covert operation made to go wrong. there's no judgment here; in fact, we come to like seal's crazy make-it-up-as-you-go-along approach to flying, to crime and to life in general.

tom cruise is perfectly cast as the cocky, reckless pilot. i've done a fair bit of flying, and i've met one or two hot-shots like (in a lesser degree) the one cruise portrays. cruise has lately been playing parts that are much too young for him (e.g. _jack reacher: never go back_), but his age works well in this case. in a way, seal is a guy fighting to stay young.

if there's one there's one thing to regret about _american made_ it's that it carefully avoids most of the political backdrop. we're told that the sandinistas were evil russian-backed communists, which is undoubtedly what the cia would have said at the time. (hindsight is more ambiguous.) we're shown, just barely, how the reagan administration evolved a cockeyed criminal scheme for its own ends, but the film ends where the public iran-contra scandal began. ollie north is a presence in only one or two shots.

nonetheless, barry seal's personal story arc is wrapped up perfectly. the ending doesn't let anyone off the hook, but it does leave us questioning our own moral position, as we're inevitably drawn to like and admire barry seal, in spite of his total lack of scruples or judgment.

doug liman directs with his usual flair. he's had a remarkably varied career, ranging from spy-action (_bourne identity_) to superheroes (_jumper_) to political drama (_fair game_) to straight-up sci-fi (_edge of tomorrow_). _american made_ stands up very well in that catalog. it's a fun film, a thoughtful film, an unusual film... though its darker side may not appeal to every taste.",high

and the result is a very enjoyable and fun period piece that has just as much drama as it does action and comedy, which allows the time dedication to slip buy unnoticed.

it's actually pretty rare that you can watch a film this long and not really feel like you're watching a long film.

the only real downside is that the end hits you a bit abruptly, a bit too abruptly for the build up...but who cares when the build-up is this enjoyable.",high

5235,"loud, trashy, sweet and weird, the mighty morphin power rangers reboot “power rangers” is not merely an ideal film for rambunctious and undemanding 12-year olds, it actually sees the world through their eyes.

in theory, the heroes are high school students. but they’re actually a disney channel-styled fantasy of the splendors that await kids when they finally become full-fledged teenagers and can do whatever they want. these heroes are misfits. they gather in detention in their high school, a scenario that promises to turn into “the mighty morphin breakfast club rangers.” lo and behold, that’s what you get: a mix of shenanigans, heart-to-heart talks and widescreen punch-outs between monster battles.

5238,"**the power of cadbury gems!**

it was one of those films known that it would fail even before being made. i've rated the rebooted 'fantastic four' better than this. i am not a 'power rangers' fan, but i was looking forward to it. expected to be a decent, not this low. the major issue with the film was the story. what the heck! all the superhero films have this same platform. that's really boring. even that's how the real 'power rangers' is, does not matter, it should have been re-wrote completely. just like they had updated the costumes from cloths to metal armours.

as usual, the actors are not to be blamed. those young guys did good. direction, not bad too. the graphic, nothing new or that impressive. if we observe closely all the cgi shot, they do not look fine, especially if you know all this stuff like an animator or something. the villain was weak. but the entire film was like just an introduction. they had held up everything till the last quarters to bring all together and make a massive stand off between the good and the bad.

maybe it could work for kids. those who liked marvel and dc superhero films would only find it a trash. the best thing about the film is, it is watchable, despite everything are familiar and predictable. i'm not in favour of a sequel, but surely they will make one. and that's result would decide the franchise's future, which i think has a slim chance against those superhero films that already bagged the large sum of fans to its pocket. as i said, the remaining one are children, who are upcoming generation. so if the filmmakers target them, even the adults would sit quiet and watch without whining.

5254,"baby (elgort) is a quiet, unassuming young man, who looks after his ailing foster parent, listens to music both out of his love for it, and a need to block out the tinnitus ringing in his ears that he was afflicted with due to a tragic accident that also took his parents. baby also has a specific skill set, one that has him doing the bidding of a crime boss doc (spacey) to pay back a debt.

baby's skill is driving, but not just any driving, the kind of skilled driving that gets doc's crew of armed bandits away from the scene of bank hold-ups very fast, and then leads crews of police cars on a merry dance, and dodges every trick up their sleeves with a few of his own set to a killer music soundtrack from his ipod.

with light at the end of the tunnel, baby has a chance encounter with cute diner waitress debora (james), where the chemistry between the two is instant. he sees this as his road to freedom, and a bright new future. this new future is brought to rude halt by doc who was not yet done with baby.

this film is all about the music soundtrack, and what a soundtrack indeed. with songs like nowhere to run by martha and the vandellas, to the quintessential driving song radar love by golden earring, you'll be tapping your toes as well as being thrilled by the action, plus the classy, and slick driving by baby.

the performances in this film are all stand out, relative new comers elgort, james, and gonzález do really well in their respective roles. the scene stealing performances by spacey, hamm, and foxx are great in support to elgort. while spacey, as he generally does, plays cool, and mellow. hamm, and foxx do it with charm, and evil menace as buddy, and bats. jon bernthal's cameo as the suspicious, and hot-headed griff was also a delight to watch.

written, and directed by cult favourite edgar wright, this film has all the elements that make this a great addition to the tradition of other heist films like drive, the getaway, and heat.

5259,"there is an episode of tales from the crypt wherein the protagonist’s conscience sounds just like – and is played by – sam kinison. oh! oh! aaaugh! this is only slightly worse than tinnitus but still slightly better than baby driver, the story of an idiot savant who is the best getaway driver in atlanta – with the caveat that he needs to listen to his ipod; when at the mercy of fm radio, baby (ansel elgort) becomes tyrone from snatch. baby suffers from tinnitus. to drown out the ringing in his ears, baby constantly listens to music – which is like putting out a fire with gasoline – even when fleeing at full speed from the scene of a crime. right. children, do not play loud music on your headphones while driving a vehicle.

baby is in love with a waitress named deborah. the coffee shop where deborah works must be worse than the carson mccullers’s sad café; how else can you explain her piss-poor decision-making? deborah has no problem running away with a guy who 1) she practically just met, 2) like cameron diaz's brother in there's something about mary, loses his sh*t when someone touches his precious earphones, 3) associates freely with criminals, 4) is himself a criminal, 5) has “every clean and dirty cop” after him, and 6) constantly puts her in danger (deborah is willing to wait five years for baby to get out of jail. she had to make a living somehow during that time, so i guess the cafeteria wasn't so bad after all).

maybe it's true that women like “bad boys” – which baby most certainly is, regardless of how innocent the movie wants us to think he is. during the third act baby is directly or indirectly responsible for four deaths; almost five when he uses deborah as bait to distract the psychopathic buddy (jon hamm). and speaking of psychos, bats (jamie foxx) is basically motherf---er jones from horrible bosses on crack – in spite of which he is the only sensible character in the film (“the driver must be the eyes and ears, not just the eyes”).

on the plus side, there is an admittedly funny moment concerning a discussion about the difference between a halloween (as in the horror film) mask and a mike myers mask. moreover, kevin spacey is a delight as always, and to no one’s surprise he and foxx have the best lines – or at least the best delivery.",low

at least that is what a good bulk of the negative reviews say.

so let's not talk about meh politics and focus on the movie instead.

my wife put it on, and i have never heard of it. i, legit, thought she was talking about simon and garfunkel when she started talking about it. ""do you want to watch baby driver?""

honest mistake, she's part guatemalan, her english isn't all that great... watch, listen to, whatever.

anyway, i was in the kitchen cooking and i missed the first part... but i was digging the music.

in fact i was digging the music so much that i started going to and from the living room, just because the soundtrack was that compelling. a great mixture of old and new.

and then it was kevin spacey and jamie foxx, and you really want to see that. both of them can turn a theatrical trick or two when they want to, and it always kind of seems that spacey always wants to... and the soundtrack.

and then when i finished cooking and we started eating in front of the television, i really started noticing the ringing when the music wasn't playing. and that was irritating... until my wife filled me in on the back story and then it was an ""ah-ha,"" moment of coolness. it was fairly compelling that they did that, and ran with it like they did.

and, i can't be absolutely positive, but it didn't like it had that much cgi, and that is a plus. it looked incredibly real, like the good old days, so even through you are watching a movie filtered through an ipod... it had an authentic action movie feel to it.

over all, it was incredibly enjoyable fun... and that is why you watch movies like this, right? because they are fun?

one note characters, a stupid plot of nothing interesting happening, and of course starlord's father, a celestial, is nothing more than an evil being setting out to destroy the universe. does marvel not realize that villains can have other kinds of motivation?

5283,"well, the soundtrack rocked. it was wonderfully classic. wonderfully sentimental. wonderfully awesome again. and it was fun how music suddenly became their thing as a team.

baby groot was fun, funny, and adorable all at the same time...and it worked because he was also a lot more violent than the adult groot, which made it stand far and away from the overly saccharin nightmare that he could have been.

star lord unfortunately matured a bit. he wasn't anywhere near the...can i say d**che bag here? jerk is too strong of a word and you never really got the impression that he was really an idiot in the first one. in any case it was that annoying quality that made him such a great character in the first movie.

in the sequel peter has grown and some of the traits that made him so fun to watch are still there...just muted as he became more of an adult.

it works for the plot, and he is still a lot of fun to watch, but a part of the appeal was that he was sort of peter pan and it hurts wa6tching someone like that grow.

the only really weak point was mantis and only really because she was clearly going to join the team and clearly not doing much of anything.

5297,"**when two different ancient arts meet.**

this is not some film. the project was decided when two leaders of the respective nation met a couple of years ago. more like it is china's move to mend the relationship with india. so except indian cast participation and a few indian locations, this is completely 'made in china' and for the chinese market. like always any chinese product, this is not a quality product. just an another 'the myth' from the same director.

team up between india and china is a rare thing in filmdom, so i was curious about that. it should have been a star studded cast, but from the chinese side, it does, not on the indian side. the worst screenplay award goes for mr. tong. literally, it is a retelling story of those great treasure hunt adventure films we had seen so far in our life. even jackie chan could not save it. his presence failed to do the usual magic. like his signature, action-comedy, nothing new to appreciate either his part or the film.

the story follows the famous chinese archaeologist jack, who teams up with his indian counterpart for a new quest. equipped with the modern technological tools, the crew heads for a frozen lake in the himalayas. it's the first and an important clue for the rest of the treasure hunt. but it was interrupted by a group of armed men and soon the tale flies to dubai, followed by western india, where it comes to end with lots of action and adventures.

> ❝'vastu shastra', the oldest book ever written about architectural design.❞

the opening scene sets in some thousand years ago. the graphics were very poor in that part. even computer games have much better cgi work. so i lost the interest in the film within the first sixty seconds. the stunt choreography was unbelievably terrible. i mean too much unrealistic, i felt it like i was watching some kind of commercial tollywood/rajamouli film. surely this film was not made under the art and the film-making value. it seems nobody was interested to participate or make a quality film. they made it to just to keep the promise made by the politicians, so it was wrapped up awfully.

i thought it was a bad combination of words for a title. kung fu and yoga. like the polar opposite, two different philosophies. one is violence and the other one is peace and healthy. though not bad how those two were utilised to tell the tale. this is a watchable film, but no good at all. might be the worst jackie chan film i've ever seen. promoting the unrealistic road projects in the film was a bad idea, and enough reason to flop in india.

there are many good actresses in india, but they have picked disha patani. she's a real beauty, but the performance was worse than the film's graphics. i could not stand for her dialogue deliverance. she just read them rather than expressing naturally as any actors do in the world. the end was really disappointing. an easy compromise. it's good for the real life, but not good for an entertainment film. those who are seeking treasure hunt film, just stay away from it. because it looks more like a parody than a distinct one. overall the film was overwhelmed by lots bad parts. so easily a skippable film of the year, which has a big name in it.

this is not for humans. a film made to entertain terrorists. there's no reason it to be called an anti-american film. but there's certain rules for everything, that's a fairy-tale always has to end 'happily ever after' and in a film about terrorism, all terrorists must die.

the biggest shock is it was made by a well known filmmaker for his some blockbusters. this is a limited cast and a day event film. i did not think the entire film was bad. only the end ruined everything. if it had a better conclusion, might have been as good as 'kajaki'.

the character looked unique, because you don't always have a highly skilled, intelligent soldier on the field. that's the best part, and then the most of the narration was simply empty, total drag or time wasting events. recommended to skip it without a second thought!

this movie essentially starts right after the first one ends, right at the top-down view of new york city. dark humor abounds,
bullets rip through head and bodies, and wick is unstoppable.

this film should be held as the gold standard for action movies. there is very little camera shake during fights and reeves clearly has spent a lot of time preparing for this role. you can see nearly every take-down, every gunshot, and wick has to reload at inconvenient times in a realistic fashion which also adds to the hilarity of the following kills.

overall the acting performances were solid. reeves isn't known for having an extremely wide range, but his devotion to making this movie a kick-ass martial arts production is second to none. i felt the villain was a bit on the weak side though, but he did his role justice. ian mcshane's character remains the strongest especially combined with the last film.

5341,"this is indeed a silly, even childish at time, movie but to me it was also a really really fun movie to watch.

the movie starts by the kingsman organisation getting screwed over royally by the psychopathic poppy adams which forces what remains of the organisation, all two people, to work with their counterpart in the united states. just as the kingsmen are parodies on the stiff upper lip british gentleman the statesmen are parodies of the southern us gentleman (if you can actually call them that) only even more so. maybe it is my european heritage but i personally feel the kingsmen are fairly cool where the drawling statesmen are more on the silly side.

once again eggsy is the main character although i have to say that i personally like harry, the original galahad, much more. he has much more charisma, elegans and smarts. since he is portrayed on the movie posters i guess it is not much of a spoiler when i say that, to my delight, the rumors of his death were greatly exaggerated. unfortunately eggsy is sometimes quite cool and plays his british gentleman role quite well and sometimes he is just dumb as a doornail.

poppy adams is okay but she is bordering on the ludicrous too much for my taste. the we have a certain english artist, a sir no less. i do not know how much they had to pay to get him to take part in this movie but i am fairly sure i would consider it too much. he was just silly as far as i am concerned.

the movie is of course loaded with gadgets, most of them of the variety that makes noises of varying levels of loudness usually resulting in one or more bad guys biting the dust. it is almost gadget overload but i really liked. sometimes this amount of totally unbelievable gadgets is dragging down the movie more than anything but in this one it was mostly a success. to me harry and the gadgetry is what makes this movie.

given that i am originally from sweden i have mixed feelings about eggsy’s girlfriend and the swedish royalties. i guess those parts were okay but i could have been without them as well. at least i feel that however wrote the scene with the “royal” dinner could have read up on swedish etiquette. knocking on a glass with your spoon, knife or fork means you are about to give a speech, not that you want the plates to be changed. a professional servant, and the swedish royalty do have professional servants, do not need to be told when to change plates.

the actual story is, well it is original at least but i would not rate it any higher than okay. it served as a vehicle for stringing together all the stunts and jokes so it served its purpose. the worst part of the story was that i was actually finding myself agreeing with the president. this might perhaps shock some people but i am sorry, if you are dumb enough to ingest that crap, which is also highly illegal, then i have no sympathy for you.

if you get upset about stupid plot details and plot holes then be prepared to be upset. there are plenty of them in this movie. to me it did not matter too much since this is not really a thriller or drama. it is a spy parody / comedy. having said that it did piss me off a bit that this advanced organisation did not have brains enough to deal with the piece of equipment left in the london cab at the beginning of the movie. i mean, it was just soo obvious what would happen.

colombians pablo escobar and virginia vallejo are played by spanish actors speaking english – or, at the very least, trying to; javier bardem's english is atrocious and penelope cruz's is abominable, and their colombian accents are just as bad, if not worse.

to confuse things further, the characters occasionally say some random words or phrases in spanish. now, i don't think it's asking too much of the audience to pretend that the characters are speaking spanish among themselves even as the actors deliver their lines in english; after all hemingway did something similar in for whom the bell tolls.

but if the characters are supposed to be speaking in their native language, shouldn’t they sound like native speakers? also, the dialogue should be consistent; i.e., all english all the time – because otherwise, what language are they supposed to be speaking when they say something in spanish?

this is a spanish film, about spanish-speaking characters, written, produced and directed by spaniards; why they felt the need to tell their story in any other language than that of cervantes, i haven’t the foggiest. except, of course, for the obvious reason of appealing to the anglo-saxon market, but in this case why go to the trouble of getting spanish – especially big names like bardem and cruz – and colombians actors, only to force them to recite most of their dialogue in english? if nothing else, they could have at least had the decency not to have cruz narrate the movie.",low

those titles i mentioned and this story has the same storyline. basically, that's very common platform where 80 per cent of the films borrow from. the scenes looked very ordinary, like there's nothing much to explore. the jokes were weaker, the characters were uninteresting in most of the parts. i would say they did not utilise them rightly. the good thing is, it is a watchable film, but the majority won't like it. usually sony animations were met with underwhelmingly, and seeing the response it had got, surely there will be no sequel, at least for now.

i will say i do like the idea, you could probably create a fine film with it. however, man did they get the execution incredibly wrong. that's also not good given the cast performances, all of which are quite pathetic. in fairness, they don't exactly get much to work with.

the opening image of writer/director greta gerwig’s impressive debut, _lady bird_, is of marion (laurie metcalf) and christine (saoirse ronan) asleep together in a hotel bed. their faces are close, like mirrored images of each other. not only do they look alike, they are two sides of the same coin. it’s why they get along so well and why they can wound each other so deeply. this mother-daughter relationship is the crux of the story lady bird tells. the movie chronicles lady bird’s (as christine insists on being called) last year of high school in sacramento. she can’t wait to leave, and is hoping to graduate and attend an east coast liberal arts school. she’s looking for culture, and sacramento has probably been in her rearview mirror for as long as she’s been alive.",high
5367,"_lady bird_ is a fantastic coming of age story that is a lot deeper than its contemporaries in the genre. it deals with more than just boys and self-discovery, but familiar past, the complex relationships between parents, and the deep understanding that home is comfort no matter how terrible it may seem in the moment. it is all crafted so well that the experience is instantly relatable allowing many viewers to resonate with her. despite this movie being a tad overhyped by many critics, it is still a brilliant film that is easy to watch and can somehow make me laugh and cry at the same time.

**score:** _90%_ |
**verdict:** _excellent_",high
5368,"garden variety coming of age films are so prevalent that it’s all the more refreshing when something truly personal and original like “lady bird” comes along. the small scale intimacy of the story about a teenage girl on the cusp of womanhood in sacramento feels raw and real, its cozy focus creating a universal anecdote that relives (with bittersweet affection) a part of life that’s filled with constantly fluctuating highs and lows. this is exactly the type of indie filmmaking that we need more of, and the awkwardly charming greta gerwig has hit a home run with her equally awkwardly charming directorial debut.

the film gives an unromantic glimpse into middle class life in 2002, where we meet lady bird (saoirse ronan), her recently laid off and depressed dad (tracy letts), and her hardworking, steadfast mom (laurie metcalf). the film is perfectly cast, with ronan and metcalf being the real standouts (the two are at their best when pushed into blow-up clashes between mother and daughter, an emotional tug of war between a teen impatient to break away from a hometown that’s beneath her and a mother so desperately hanging on that she’s unable to express her love and disappointment). it’s apparent the actors felt emotionally connected to the material while on set, and their performances bring a biting honesty and empathy to the family dynamics of gerwig’s screenplay.

gerwig has said the film is semi-autobiographical and she writes with an authentic voice, taking great care with her story (a story told with the hindsight of being a grown up). she brings a confident wisdom, an earnest insight, and a fresh voice through a witty and bright script that mirrors her true-to-life, free spirited personality. it’s as if the film exists within its own glowing aura. with gerwig at the helm, the film has a particular hipster quirkiness written all over it, yet its sunny disposition and sharp humor is abundant with sincerity and avoids falling into the trap of being overly cynical or jaded.

the film is so observant that i could totally and wholly relate to our adolescent heroine through a realism that instantly transported me to the past. while i grew up in a different decade, some of the situations seemed like actual pages ripped out of my own high school experience. there are plenty of moments in a teenage girl’s life where the trivial becomes momentous and the momentous becomes devastating, and they are presented here with a poignant and compassionate vibrancy that i’ve rarely seen so accurately captured on film.",high

5376,"i want to start by saying i’m tired of seeing the big names in every movie i see, i think at times big name actors can take away from a movie more than benefit.  dunkirk did a great job of allowing us to focus less on the actors and more on the story. i feel this movie put me in the story and allowed to experience first hand some of the lives that were impacted.

there wasn’t a lot of character building in this movie, but that’s what i loved, i feel like i was allowed to more so build on the experience over one person’s story. since we’re not typically used to a movie being experience based over character based, i think some may find this as a flaw.  i did not. there were multiple stories and perspectives, all which immerse you into the current situation.

christopher nolan did a great job of creating an overwhelming feeling of hopelessness throughout the movie, i felt like i could never feel safe and constantly looked for a way out. i was on the edge of my seat for the majority of the movie.

5378,"i have put off viewing this film for quite a while. the main reason for this is that i am somewhat reluctant watching a movie where the story is pretty well known before you sit down to watch it. however a few days ago i finally did and, given all the hype, i have to say that i expected more, a lot more.

sure the movie is a cinematically very well down movie. acting, camera and all that is excellent. unfortunately that is all there is.

first of all, where the hell did the over-inflated budget go? dunkirk was a major undertaking with almost 400 000 soldiers involved and hundreds and hundreds of boats. we get to see what? a few columns of soldiers, a handful of boats and three pitiful spitfires against a bomber and two fock wulfes. to add to this insult we pretty much get to see the same bloody event over and over from different angles. this is an insult to all the brave men that made this rescue possible.

there are a few likable people in the movie. like the navy commander and the elderly guy on the pleasure boat steaming to rescue. the rest are either psychotic or morons.

realism? not so much. like the scene where a bunch of soldiers are trapped in a boat being shot to pieces. would any one in their right mind really have thought they could plug dozens and dozens of holes with their hands and then sail across the channel?

then we have the spitfire which runs out of fuel and glides around forever over the beach so the director can get some scenic shots done. other times fairly large boats gets damaged and flips over in seconds.

i would also have expected some pre-story. some build up. but no, the story starts right away with these measly handful of boats and planes taking for bloody ever to drag themselves over to where they are supposed to go.

quite a disappointment indeed.",low
5380,"it starts off well, with a little glimpse of a british soldier that was as unprepared as the uk for the war. it's a nice teaser...

...then a little story about the civilian involvement with the evacuation...

...and it all comes with the promise of being a british ""saving private ryan.""

unfortunately it ends up being a lot more michael bay than steven spielberg. that is to say that it looks nice and sleek and professional but is otherwise lacking in a real story.

spielberg managed to tell a story that was both pro-soldier and anti-war, and that made the whole normandy beach until the very end a pleasure to watch.

dunkirk, on the other hand, gives up about 15 minutes in and decides to just focus on the action with the story being an after thought.

in short it's boring.",low
5381,"**considering the quality and talent of those involved, the budget and all the variables, the film is unforgivably disappointing.**

the dunkirk disaster was one of the opening moments of world war ii: in the face of the unstoppable advance of german troops, a mixture of british, belgian and french soldiers were pushed into the english channel, fortifying themselves in the french city of dunkirk. the prospects could not be worse: in a few weeks, hundreds of thousands of exhausted allied soldiers found themselves surrounded by a powerful panzer division and under constant attack by german aviation, having no port capable of evacuation, which would be carried out by smaller vessels in the so-called “operation dynamo”. and everything indicated that, after france, it would be england that suffered the german invasion, so the british could not be more apprehensive.

despite the fact that the film paints the episode in a positive light (trying to highlight the ability that the british had to successfully evacuate their troops), there is no doubt that dunkirk was a disaster and is, even today, one of the most humiliating moments of british military history, comparable to a similar situation that occurred in 1809 in a coruña, where british soldiers also found themselves between the sea and the enemy, this time napoleon's army. moreover, this film turns out to be a kind of remake of a film with the same name and the same theme made in the 50s.

directed by christopher nolan (a talented and fashionable director), the film has a cast full of strong names in the industry. mark rylance has the most prominence in the role of a civilian, owner of a small yacht, who decides to go personally to rescue soldiers with his sons. tom hardy also gives us an excellent job, in the role of a british aviator who helps as he can. cillian murphy is believable in his work, giving us an idea of the shock a soldier can experience in a combat situation. harry styles and aneurin barnard also deserve a positive note. sir kenneth branagh stands out, embodying the figure of british stoicism, but i found his character somewhat forced to be more impassive than would be plausible in that situation.

despite its merits, it is an indisputably cold and unexciting film. anyone expecting incredible shootouts or grandiose battle scenes will be disappointed and have to settle for some good dogfight-style fighter combats and some more tense scenes, but which never materialize in combat scenes worthy of a great war movie. and considering the number of soldiers surrounded there, one would expect to see a crowd of soldiers... however, this only happens occasionally, and it even seems that production has saved on the means. written in a simplistic way, the script distracts attention and places more emphasis on what is happening in the sea and in the sky, so the german threat is something that we don't quite understand and that the film doesn't waste time explaining. with me, that wasn't a problem, but the worst history students will have to read a little to find out what's going on. the characters are also not developed: there is no concrete villain because the enemy soldiers are collectively, so there is also no undisputed protagonist character.

technically, it has several merits and demerits to consider. on the one hand, it is an authentic visual spectacle thanks to a masterful filming work and a remarkable and very well crafted cinematography. the sound also deserves praise thanks to very good effects, very well-used and, of course, a tense and efficient soundtrack signed by hans zimmer (in yet another collaboration with nolan). unfortunately, the editing is bad and, if the script already had flaws, the non-linear narrative accentuated them even more, making the film confusing and strange.",low
5384,"phenomenal film. loved every second.

i've been aware of this film, in name only (didn't know any of the plot etc.), since it came out and have always had a great feeling about it - i just had an inkling it would be great. it isn't, it's much more than that... it's incredible.

the mix between the humour and seriousness is superb, i found myself laughing aloud one moment and then feeling saddened minutes later; that was the case a ridiculous amount of times throughout the 115 minutes.

the premise is pretty mad and filled with coincidences, but i absolutely adore the way it is written and put together onscreen. the cinematography is also beautiful, as is the score. the pacing is fantastic too. all that is without even mentioning the cast, who are outstanding.

what a terrific performance from frances mcdormand, who i always remember from 1998's <em>'madeline'</em> - one of the first films i recall watching at a young age. she's utterly brilliant as mildred, from the first scene to the last. her co-stars are also top notch, so well cast.

woody harrelson (willoughby) and sam rockwell (dixon) are great in their respective roles, while my personal got king peter dinklage (james) also appears in a minor part. i liked caleb landry jones (red), also.

<em>'three billboards outside ebbing, missouri'</em> is a must-watch!",high
5385,"it was one of the better movies i've seen in that it plays on nostalgia and not nostalgia to a bygone decade, but more nostalgia for the old story driven indie and quasi-indie films that ruled the 1990s.

back in the day ""pulp fiction"" could win academy awards and tiny no budget movies like ""clerks"" and ""reservoir dogs"" could gain cult followings and make long and successful careers out of their writer-directors.

""three billboards"" has all of that, the story based on characters and situations not based on political rhetoric and special effects. you get the sense, when you watch it, that they wanted to tell a story and that was all that mattered to them.

there was a story to tell and everyone came together to tell it in the best way that they could...so it was moving, and it was funny, and it was dramatic, and it was oddly dark and oddly heartwarming.

you walk away feeling that you've seen a movie, and you have. that's exactly what this is, an actual movie. it's not special effects strung together on the backs of weak characters playing out a plot that has been rebooted several times...it's an actual movie that tells an actual story.

it's original. it's worth watching. it deserved everything that came its way at the rewards and more. it's the kind of movie that we need to see more of and its the kind of movie that i dearly miss seeing.

this is an extremely impressive film from peele. its smart and knows it-- teasing you along the way of what is to unfold at the film's climax.

the main character is a photographer goes to visit his gf's house and all-white family. things are not as they appear at first glance, and as the film progresses it becomes even more disturbingly obvious that the family is hiding a secret. as time goes on, cracks begin to form in the sticky sweet facade of pleasantness surrounding the home. beyond this i can't spoil it, but the third act of this film is very satisfying. i don't think there was any part of this film that overstayed its welcome or felt weak. 

the acting performances overall are superb, the cinematography is excellent, and the lighting is also well done. 

please go see this movie if you are into horror/comedy, its worth supporting.",high
5388,"**opening remarks**

i went out to see this film armed only with the snippets i watched in the form of television commercials and youtube ads. the film had a very interesting look and  that really caught my attention. i noticed that the film focused primarily on race, which seemed like an interesting concept for a horror/psychological thriller. i also saw that jordan peele (of ""key and peele"" fame) was the director of the film and i was thrown completely off about what type of movie i was going to get.

**first impressions**

to start off, this film is gorgeous and this presents itself fairly early into the film. gorgeous quality, gorgeous scenery, gorgeous people. added with the minimal soundtrack, the film seems very open. many horror movies try to go for a claustrophobic approach, while ""get out"" uses its spacious atmosphere to bring out the unnerving fear of the unknown.

**going smoothly**

other than a few moments of ""how exactly is this scientifically possible?,"" you do not have to suspend your belief too often throughout the film. ""get out"" has an easy to follow, coherent story line that is aided by its pacing. honestly, this is some of the best pacing have seen a modern horror film in a long time. every sequence in this film seems to take the same amount of time and keeps the film moving along at a brisk pace. every scene is refreshing and contains a new bit of information, instead of lingering on unimportant details. every sequence is shot with purpose.

**getting to know the cast**

the acting in this movie is very well done. the interactions between characters seemed genuine and characters reacted to situations in appropriate manners. this isn't your average horror movie where the characters make stupid decisions to continue the plot; it all seems very organic. the characters act in a manner that you really connect with and do things that you could see yourself doing in these situations.

**further considerations**

as i mentioned earlier, the film was directed by jordan peele, who has almost exclusively worked in comedy. as a fan of ""key and peele"" skits and their major film, ""keanu,"" i thought i had this film figured out before going to see it. with its subject matter about race, i figured this movie would be more of a joke than it was a straight-up horror film. and while the film is a very witty satire on race relations in america and features some very humorous dialogue and situations, the film drives the horrors of racism to the furthest point. the humor stems mostly from the absurdity of the films premise.

**that ending**

i do not have any major complaints about the movie. it didn't drag on, it mimicked reality, and gave me some very uneasy feelings, which is a plus for a horror film. the only problem i have with the film is the ending. it wraps itself up way too quickly and throws everything at you all at once. luckily, the ending does resolve itself and doesn't leave any glaring loose ends. the film does end a bit too abruptly for my taste and it would have been nice to see what happens afterwards.

**closing**

i would recommend this film to anybody looking for a different horror experience. it is tasteful and tame compared to other films, but it certainly doesn't distract from its purpose.",high
5392,"i loved this movie. i can’t express how happy and excited this movie made me for reasons i’ll talk about here…

most haven't seen, but this is what i was talking about yesterday with my review on brightburn (on letterboxd). it was a horror movie with a good idea bad bad execution with no plot or character development to help us care about the characters. get out is the perfect mix of horror, character development, and plot.

horror - i was thoroughly creeped out in the beginning and it slowly built up over time which i loved. it didn’t go for cheap scares, it built up the suspense over time that made the ending so scary. i was 100% sure chris was going to die or be mind controlled by the end.

character development - i loved the character development in the movie and i’ll tell you why. it helps us care so much about these characters. i really wanted chris to be safe and i was on the edge of my seat to see him get out. i loved the tsa cop and how funny he was without ruining the mood of the film. i wanted to see the slaves get set free even though they ended up killing themselse. and i was honestly sad to see the girlfriend turn out to be evil. it just emotionally attached me to the movie and it made the movie 10x better for it.

plot - i loved the plot because of the fact it surprised me and didn’t give me what i expected. i was expecting the movie to turn out bad for the main character but it turned out to be good. i didn’t see any way for chris to escape but he did using interesting ways i didn’t think of. i loved the ending with the tsa cop pulling up instead of a racist one. twists like that just made the movie fun. overall i like how it built a great story that really carried the movie.",high
5393,"**an excellent film, which deserves our attention.**

i saw this movie yesterday. i've been thinking about it for a while, and yesterday i took the opportunity to do so. i already had a notion that it was a very successful film, and that it was successful at the box office and with specialized critics. for a horror movie, that's pretty good stuff. for my part, i think it's a good film, well above average. it's a tense film, that works well with the environment... and yes, it has scary moments. nominated for best film, best actor and best original screenplay, it won an oscar in the latter category.

the script works, mostly, on the issue of more educated racism, maintained and cultivated by the white elites of some north american circles where, without harassing blacks, they are seen as “rare birds” in the environment where they are. afterwards, the film departs from this base to something denser and darker: the protagonist begins to realize that the people in that family act strangely, and that the black people who are there seem to be automatons. it's worth seeing what happens next...

this film seeks, in every way, to escape the stigma of american terror: the scares that, due to the action of the effects, make us jump in our seats. seeking to give us more, he works a lot with the environment, and the tension gradually builds up as our sympathy for the main character grows. and that's the strong point of the film, and what makes it different, on the positive side. jordan peele did a very competent job directing, and showed that he understands horror and can give the genre a breath of fresh air. and this becomes even more relevant if we consider an aspect already highlighted by many people: he was a complete novice when he directed the film.

regarding the performances, i think it's fair to value daniel kaluuya's performance, more than committed and tense. he was really very good and if the film works so well, in part, it is due to this very competent actor. allison williams also leaves a good performance. i especially liked catherine keener's work. she does a very small job, appears for a short time in the film, but is very impactful.

despite not being a big budget film, i think i knew how to make the best use of every coin and prove that a good film doesn't really need to be expensive to make. the cinematography is very good, it is within the standard of current films, but it does its job very well. the sets and costumes don't stand out much either, although we have to highlight some quality notes, such as the clothes of some characters and, very in particular, the room where one of the characters ends up imprisoned. the visual and sound effects are good, and are used with intelligence and care. the soundtrack does, without imposing itself, a competent and discreet job.",high
5394,"man all you fans are going to be embarrassed once racism is bad again... remember back in the day where we were supposed to judge people by the content of their character and not the color of their skin?  that attitude is going to come back, in many cases it never died, and even though the faux progressives are pushing to judge people by their skin color... yeah, people are going to just not be racist.

this is incredibly racist.  it makes a few points.  

1) it is anti-miscegenation, the movie is very much against interracial relationships.

2) the movie suggests (like all of his movies) that all white people are not only racist but evil.

3) deep down all white people want to be black, the reverse of that joke in chasing amy.

and it sort of rolls with that through the duration of the film, the messaging is clear, and what is probably why it has so much praise behind it, it hits the most important political mark: ""all white people are evil, they are the source of all evil, they need to be punished for it.""

it tells a story about the brutal death of an indian girl, and her missing boyfriend. we see the actions of a few dedicated, over worked, law officers trying to solve the crime and bring the perpetrator to justice, and a civilian tracker contracted to help them. it pushes no hidden or thinly veiled agenda.

however, the film is not without its flaws. the plot is at times far-fetched, with some details feeling contrived and hard to believe. the climax, which features an overdramatized shoot out, felt out of place and took away from the film's realistic tone.

additionally, there is a strange and unsettling scene in which the victim's mother self-harms herself in a way that feels unnecessary and out of place. while the scene may be meant to emphasize the mother's grief and trauma, it comes across as gratuitous and uncomfortable to watch.

despite these flaws, the film's incredible cast, led by jeremy renner and elizabeth olsen, deliver powerful and nuanced performances. their chemistry on screen is palpable, and their interactions are often filled with tension and heart.

furthermore, the direction by taylor sheridan is masterful, with his unique vision of the american west driving the plot and setting the tone. wind river is a thought-provoking and emotionally charged film that, while flawed in places, is still highly recommended for fans of crime dramas and powerful storytelling.

**⚠ spoilers ahead ⚠**

things turn stupid when they start to experiment with that unknown life-form in a lab not suited for that at all. and they don't use remote controlled robot-arms but simple rubber gloves. the life-form, of course, instinctively knows how to use tools and how to penetrate rubber.

it then flees through a co₂ nozzle (after an empty! flamethrower still had its pilot flame on and triggered the fire alarm) and doesn't end up in some tank but no, somehow gets into the rest of the space station. and this was only possible, because the computer to close the nozzles is a 1950s pocket calculator and you have to close them one by one by entering a 20-digit id for each one or so it seems.

the story is driven by people knowingly opening hatches that should've been kept closed. or not talking to each other, like telling the others that the creature is currently nibbling at one's leg.

another highlight is the creature, finally trapped outside the station, finding its way back in through the effing thrusters. why they seem to be connected to the inside of the space station is beyond me.

same applies to 2 guys venting all air from a (sealed) module, but a 3rd guy opening the hatch from a pressurised area to said module without any indication the module was without pressure. (and, of course, he didn't know anything about the creature being trapped there, because he threw away his comm device the moment it had a bit of reception issues earlier.)

the whole movie is so wrong, i almost had to laugh. especially, when the last survivors escape in 2 separate escape pods and the one which should reach earth gets hit by debris and flies into outer space and the other one, *trying* to get away from earth is kept from doing that by the creature who suddenly seemed to have acquired knowledge about steering nasa issue escape pods and is keeping the human from altering the course.

here's the most overrated film, not just for the year, but forever. the title says it all, a big sick flick. just remember, it was only based on the real, not a biopic. because they have changed entire storytelling to cinematic convenient. to fool the people from the actual truth. so the terrorists are shown in a good light. good humans won't support such barbaric people.

it's a shame that american academy awards recognised it. only best thing in the film were the holly hunter and ray ramona. even in the real life characters, they were brainwashed, along with emily. totally skippable film. instead, i would strongly suggest to watch 'punching henry', 'obvious child', 'sleepwalk with me' and even 'the vow' or you you could find many more in film database. don't waste your time with it!

5435,"i've killed everything that's walked or crawled. if you do it enough, you get used to it.

hostiles is directed by scott cooper and cooper adapts the screenplay from the story written by donald e. stewart. it stars christian bale, rosamund pike, wes studi, rory cochrane, john benjamin hickey, jeremiah wilks and jesse plemons. music is by max richter and cinematography by masanobu takayanagi.

in 1892, legendary capt. joseph j. blocker (bale) reluctantly has to escort his old cheyenne adversary chief yellow hawk (studi) and his family through dangerous territories. the aim is to get them to the cheyenne tribal homelands of montana so yellow hawk can get his wish to die in peace. 

where we at these days with the grand old bastion of american cinema, the western? the only real constant is that thankfully for lovers of the form there are new directors willing to tackle the genre and bring something to the newer generations. here we have scott cooper, who right from the off hasn’t hid the fact that hostiles is his rallying call for a better world, or at least a better understanding of different cultures. what better way to cry out than to do it in a western, using the indian wars as the backdrop. perfect really.

hostiles jumps right out of the blocks to grab you by the throat with soul shattering violence, with cooper and his team initially facing charges of old by fronting up a one sided argument – but there is more. quickly a switch ensures that both sides of this particular bloody coin have been tossed, scene set for what will follow. a meeting back at fort berringer where captain blocker receives the orders he simply doesn’t want to obey is in hushed tones, yet the words being spoken are brutally loud and to the point. and on to the journey, damaged souls unbound who not only have to fear hostiles from outside their group, but the hostiles within it and within themselves.

as the story moves through the journey undertaken by our protagonists, the makers have not cut corners with the characterisations, the emotional development of the principals is one of the film’s strengths (cast are superb, there’s a real authenticity to their respective performances). also worthy is the pacing, it is deliberately unhurried and allows the characters to breathe, it also gives the jolts of action more potency, whilst simultaneously we can absorb the stunning landscapes (new mexico/arizona) and rejoice at the pleasures of an outdoor western.  while how nice it is to have a musical score that doesn’t blunderbuss the important sequences, rounding out what is a top technical production.

there’s some irritants here, though, so it’s not perfect, and this is before it is marked poorly by those not in sync with the messages of the piece. ben foster turns up as philip wills, a most edgy character that makes one wish there was far more of him in the pic, for as it is it ends up feeling a bit pointless since he only emphasises what we have learned about blocker at the start. then there’s a key turn of events for the story’s  coup de grâce that leaves a frustrating taste in the mouth, not as a film killer or even close in fact, but it should have gone another way one feels. especially given the two sides of the argument stance cooper and co had began with.

yet this is for western fans a real treat, following in the footsteps of new era classics like dances with wolves and unforgiven, hostiles may have a new age sensibility in its narrative thrust, but traditionally old age adultness propels it forward. 9/10",high

ever wondered how abe from hellboy had sex? well this movie explains it.

but honestly, it isn't bad. it's a total period piece. it's beautiful, i mean it is very beautiful, and it has a story.

but, yeah, the thing about it is that it's beautiful and has a story. the english patient, brokeback mountain, they were just beautiful and beauty alone with no story behind it is boring. the fisk f***** movie had both.

and, yeah, the story is something we are used to. it was the good, friendly monster that had to be rescued by the mean nasty government plot and, especially if you are a child of the 80s, it works. it's a plot that we've seen over and over again...only in kids movies.

this fish f***er movie, the plot is made for adults, so less adventure and fart jokes and a lot more beauty slightly deeper issues, issues that equate homosexual and racial issues to being the outsider that matters...in the right way. not the immature and racist way that we see in black panther and get out...

...so it's refreshing to see that handled subtly and politely and still make the point.

gorgeously shot on 35mm, this film is a feast for the eyes. it uses every colour in the crayon box from the gloriously purple exterior to the dilapidated magic kingdom motel to the impossibly bright oranges, reds, and greens of the local shops where the kids venture every day. while plasticky and candy-like during the day scenes, the film is even more stunning at sundown - the dusty, sun-drenched shots here are sublime.

everyone has been abuzz about willem dafoe's performance in this. he's absolutely charming and is the glue that holds these dejected people's lives together in this film. he's the father figure to all of them and he does the absolute most with his character. the breakthrough star of this film, however, is 7-year-old brooklynn prince. she's an absolute superstar. during the q&a at the north american premiere she wore a baby blue princess gown and simultaneously waved like queen elizabeth ii and blew kisses at the audience as they gave her a standing ovation. child performers lately have been better and better - remember how good jacob tremblay was in _room_? just you wait for prince to wow you in this. she has a scene at the very end of the movie that requires her to break down and cry and it tore my heart out.",high

5464,"alongside _weekend_ and _moonlight_, _call me by your name_ is the greatest queer film i have seen in the past ten years. it's a gorgeous, quiet masterwork - luca guadagnino has given us something truly special here. i'll cherish this one for a long, long time as it's extremely human and very personal. the fact that the legendary james ivory wrote the screenplay for this shoots this over the top and slam dunks it into the cinematic stratosphere. truly stunning work that deserves to be remembered, preserved, and celebrated for decades to come.

the performances in this are so mesmerizing. i've never liked armie hammer as much as i like him in this. he really embodies his character and it's a lived in, fully realized performance. timothée chalamet - who has a great year ahead of him with other big projects - is absolutely captivating as the young lead in this coming-of-age tale. i've seen many a coming-of-age film, but this one is one of the truest portrayals of a gay youth coming to terms with his sexuality, emotions, and his own body.

5473,"**a good psychological horror movie.**

for me, the only good thing about halloween is the amount of horror movies on television. the anglo-saxon reader, don't get me wrong, i know it's a tradition very dear to the americans and the british, and i respect that, in the same way i respect dia de los muertos. but in my country, this tradition is non-existent. i only started hearing about it fifteen years ago, due to an irresistible alliance between commerce (always interested in selling trinkets and masks left over from carnival) and the weight of globalization, which turns cultural variety into a homogeneous, tasteless soup. what we have in my country is just the catholic celebration of all saints and, the next day, the religious feast of the deceased, with the traditional pilgrimage to the cemeteries. for those who are not christian or have no one dear in the cemetery, maybe these are days like any other. but let's get down to business!

as you can see, i saw this movie for halloween, and i really liked what i saw. despite the presence of sérgio sánchez, who signs the script and guarantees impeccable direction, and despite having been filmed and produced in spain, the film features english-speaking actors and the entire story takes place in the united states. the script begins with the arrival of a mother, with her children, to her family home, which has been closed for a long time. it's clear from the start that they are on the run and hiding from an abusive husband/father left in europe. everything goes well until the mother's death, who leaves the children in the care of the eldest. from then on, they try to hide her death until he turns 21, the age from which he will be entitled to be the brothers' legal guardian, thus ensuring that they all remain together.

there's so much more to the script, it's not just a family melodrama about close-knit brothers and the dangers of an abusive father. terror is very present in the remains of that decrepit house, where something else is present, and a dark secret hidden somewhere on the upper floor, totally inaccessible. the young orphans' relationship with allie, their closest neighbor, and with a lawyer from the nearby town, will be the impetus for new developments, which will lead us to know more about the young people, and what really exists in that isolated house. the film is full of twists, and some of them surprised me a little.

george mackay is the great protagonist of the film and gives us a truly superb, deep and sometimes disturbing interpretation. despite the quality of the cast, in general, being good, he stands out from the others and steals our attention whenever he appears. charlie heaton is another good addition, and especially shines in the scenes where he plays with mackay, in particular in his various conflicts. tom fisher is quite effective as a villain, even though he is not happy with his character, stripped of any depth and turned into a mad beast, a closet monster determined to eat little children. anya taylor-joy was a nice and effective addition, but it has very little to do.

technically, the film relies heavily on cinematography, filming locations, sound effects and set design. the cinematography takes advantage of the cold colors and misty days, as well as the dim light from the interiors of the house, and from the lit candles, to help create a tense and suitably somber atmosphere, which is thickened by the sound effects, very well used, and by the scenery of the country house, aged and in need of works. the house is transformed, as in other scary house movies, into an additional character in the plot, with its own personality and its own history and quirks. the choice of costumes and cars puts us in tune with the time when everything happens (the 50s). however, it lacks an effective and truly memorable soundtrack.",high
5479,"the protagonist of this movie briefly mentions the jonestown massacre, which is ironic considering he's the one who ends up drinking the proverbial kool-aid. 

the case for christ follows the hero as he transitions from a quote-unquote investigative reporter to a christian pastor — not a big loss to the former profession, since lee strobel (mike vogel) appears to have graduated from the geraldo school of journalism, pornstache included. 

accordingly, the results of his investigation are as disappointing as the contents of al capone's vault. for reasons not worth recounting, lee’s wife leslie (erika christensen) decides to accept christ into her heart; the atheist lee reacts to the news as if she’d just confessed having a lover (indeed, at one point he even accuses her of “cheating on him with jesus”).  

following his mentor's advice, lee sets out to prove that the resurrection never happened and thereby discredit christianity. the rest of the film is an illustration that for those who believe in god, no explanation is necessary, and for those who do not believe, no explanation is possible. i would add that for those watching the case for christ, no explanation is provided. 

in essence, the titular case for christ is made up of a mixture of ipse dixit, proof by assertion, ad hoc hypothesis, and cherry picking. at no time does strobel question any of this, and the reason is simple: if he did, the entire house of cards would fall faster than kabul to the taliban. “when is enough evidence enough evidence?” someone asks strobel; the answer, which the film conveniently evades, is: when it comes to anecdotal evidence, never. 

worst of all, the real-life strobel's beliefs are as inconsistent and questionable as his journalism; he is so secretly ashamed of his conversion that, in addition to this film and the book on which it is based, there is a documentary, all with the sole purpose of publicly justifying his decision, which after all is absolutely nobody's business but his own.  

it’s safe to conclude that just as strobel blatantly lies to his audience, so does he lies to himself (unless his so-called faith is nothing more than a scam to relieve fools of their money, which seems more likely than anything else).",low

for the first half hour or so the movie looks like being your standard revenge thriller, but then the tone of the movie takes a  dramatic unexpected shift.

it's at this point our protagonist, jen, falls off a cliff and lands onto a tree below in which a branch impales her through the back and out through her midriff. after what in all seriousness should've been a fatal fall you're left thinking; ""surely she's dead, right?"" i mean, i know action flicks are far fetched, but surely they aren't gonna just write this off as the equivalent to a grazed knee. half an hour in and you've seemingly killed off the main character, hmm. is her identical twin or ghost or something going to take revenge, you're left wondering? even if she were somehow to miraculously survive, there's no way she'd be in any condition to take revenge. 

alas, she does survive and she finds a novel way to free herself from the tree she is impaled and suspended from. _note: this is the part in the movie when you turn your brain off._
after bleeding out for hours in the desert heat, our heroine spots a lighter on the ground within reaching distance. remember this part; she's in reaching distance from the ground, got that!
she comes to the conclusion that the best way to free herself is to **burn the tree down.** that's right, she's going to burn the tree down of which she is impaled just feet from the ground where a fire is burning below her. genius! 
anyway, her big brained plan actually works and she manages to get down without burning herself alive.

skip ahead to where she needs to patch herself up. next task is to fix the gaping wound running through her body. she finds a cave after acquiring some supplies and you're thinking the 'rambo scene' must be coming up where she cauterizes the wound.
now i'm no stranger to suspending my disbelief, but what happens next defies all logic and reason.
she recalls she stashed some peyote in her locket from earlier. according to her now ex-boyfriend, you can cut your own leg off no problem with this stuff and you won''t even feel it, so it'll pass for a painkiller. instead of pouring gunpowder into her open wound and then lighting it, she decides to go the 'heated beer can route.' not just any beer can, mexican beer - with a nifty eagle logo.
after branding herself with the hot metal beer can it magically seals up her back wound also. ah, the wonders of modern medical care.
as an extra to her life saving self-surgery, she picked up a new eagle tattoo imprinted from beer can. there appears to be some witchcraft at work also, because instead of leaving a negative print (a reverse image) the eagle's logo along with its text are transferred the correct way around. you can't help but laugh out loud. this is one of many plot holes throughout the movie that are so gaping (like the one that should still be visible in jen's back) you cannot help be drawn to them.
mirror images seem to be a theme as you'll notice later in the movie. 

at this time, jen has taken on a kind of mary sue meets rambo persona. she doesn't need blood, food or water to survive; or internal organs for that matter, and she has an essence of indestructibility. the film has entered a kind of dark comedy territory.
we proceed in the story when she hunts down her transgressors and it turns out jen's not the only one who can withstand near fatal damage. the friday the 13th franchise passes more for realism at this stage in comparison and the movie more resembles an outrageous music video.

in summary: revenge is mildly entertaining if you can get past its absurdity and idiotic plot holes. unfortunately, that's where it has to lose so many marks for me. the filmmakers treat their audience as morons and you cannot ignore so many obvious errors. that ruined the experience for me.

5508,"luca's ""suspiria"" brought me no words.

the horror in this movie is not like anything else i've ever heard or seen. the sheer film in luca's ""suspiria"" is not like anything that is made by major movie studios such as columbia, paramount, 20th century fox, disney, and the like. director luca guadagnino transitioning from the lgbtq+ drama adaptation ""call me by your name"" — transitioning to the avant-garde, psychological study in his version of famed director dario argento's 1977 ""suspiria"".

horror movies today don't scare me. horror movies of the 21st century seem to be involved in so much gratuitous gore, typical plotlines, a roulette set of actors playing quasi-characterization, varying degress of quality. luca's ""suspiria"" — a horror movie from 2018 — did not scare me. luca's ""suspiria"" unnerved me. luca's ""suspiria"" built slowly in tension, but also captivated me with raw interest — ""suspiria"" dealt its final blow, finishing with a nightmarish sixth act and an epilogue.

argento's ""suspiria"" is a movie out of time in its own way. argento's ""suspiria"", a film released in 1977, looks fresh and modern — argento's ""suspiria""'s fixation on primary neon colors and gore — argento's ""suspiria"" with prog-rock, percussion score by the band goblin. director dario argento, however, does not like luca's ""suspiria"". director dario argento claims it is without spirit, fear and music — argento thinks the design is beautiful, so guadagnino must have done something right.

luca's ""suspiria"" is a movie unlike anything out of sheer audacity to become its own. luca's ""suspiria"" in the way it handles narrative into six different, self-contained ""acts"" ending with an epilogue — luca's ""suspiria"" in its washed-out, bleak setting complementing queer, disenfranchised coloring and nonconforming visual narrative — luca's ""suspiria"" with its brooding realism, mysterious witchcraft and black magic — luca's ""suspiria"" with mesmerizing visuals; unexplained syntax; self-contained exposure; restraint. horror in luca's ""suspiria"" is much more than simple disgusting imagery — gore in luca's ""suspiria"" is far and in between, but is visceral and disgusting all the same — nudity in luca's ""suspiria"" is all female, except one male.

politics and dance in luca's ""suspiria"" are vital to understanding 2018 ""suspiria"". dance carries witchcraft and spells, and with it — uncompromising emotion, femininity, power, and rawness. the german autumn of 1977, in which luca's ""suspiria"" is set in a time where berlin is divided into east and west (and when argento's ""suspiria"" was released). the lufthansa hijacking and the raf faction. the mention of the third reich by dr. klemperer as a religion, and a delusion. what is and is not a delusion.

there's something dramatic about luca's ""suspiria"" itself. dr. lutz klemperer in losing his beloved wife, anke, in the holocaust. sara in losing her beloved friend, patricia. madame blanc in beginning to love her newfound daughter, only to regret what she has done to her. the three girls in the ritual wishing for death, to be given a motherly kiss and then die. klemperer's meek inability to stop what he has witnessed through psychotherapy; his helpless stature in the finale. his erased memory to absolve him of his guilt, and of what he had to witness.

dakota johnson; the one actress from the terrible, mainstream ""fifty shades"" film trilogy. dakota johnson becomes remarkably unnerving, feminine, sexual, motherly, and incomprehensible. tilda swinton — her counterpart, lutz ebersdorf. tilda swinton's role as a matriarch and founding mother of a coven; lutz ebersdorf's role as a skeptical psychotherapist; a grieving widow. chloe grace moretz as a politically-troubled woman; unstable woman; paranoid woman. everyone's performance as their roles felt utterly average — everyone's average performance as their roles grounded reality to the movie.

thom yorke in the music department did a nice job. thom yorke's score for luca's ""suspiria"" evoked the mood of a 70s prog-rock band with a niche for ambient synthscapes, musique concrete moods and piano experimentation; if we're judging thom yorke's soundtrack, its a nice collection of songs that should have been a radiohead double album than a soundtrack. of course, thom yorke's score did not always fit luca's ""suspiria""; some scenes with thom yorke's pieces grated the scenes' moods to pieces, yet in a similar manner as goblin's score for argento's ""suspiria"".
* a movie that left me deeply unsettled, and scared in my subconscious. a movie that made me depressed when it was depressed. a multi-faceted piece, luca's ""suspiria"" is a rooted testament in femininity and matriarchy. luca's ""suspiria"" is a movie without words.",high

- dario argento's assessment of _suspiria_; _un giorno da pecora_ (january 18, 2019)

released in 1977, dario argento's giallo classic _suspiria_ (the first part of his _tre madri_ [_three mothers_] trilogy) has a plot you could fit on a stamp – a young american dancer goes to the famous tanz dance academy in freiburg im breisgau, germany, only to find it's a front for a witches coven. that's it, and as the film barely leaves the confines of the academy, there is no contextualising of the plot against any kind of socio-political background. by no means is it a good film, with terrible acting, a dire script, and laughable effects, but it's immensely enjoyable, partly because it's genuinely creepy in places, but mainly because it doesn't take itself too seriously; the filmmakers know it's nothing more than a surreal, gaudy, style-over-substance, shock-for-shock's sake, grand guignol head-trip, and they lean into that identity rather than trying to transcend it. luca guadagnino's remake (yes folks, it's a remake) is the polar opposite – it has an intricate plot covering all manner of themes and topics, featuring several new characters, and setting everything against a complex socio-political background; the acting and effects are excellent; it takes itself very, very seriously; and it continually tries to prove to the viewer that it is much more than a piece of kitsch horror. according to guadagnino, his version of _suspiria_ is a ""_homage_"" to the ""_powerful emotions_"" of the original (it's a remake), whilst actress tilda swinton calls it ""_a cover version_"" (it's a remake). the real question, however, is not how similar or dissimilar it is to argento. the real question is whether the film is a beautifully mounted insightful exploration of female sexuality, a celebration of a self-contained matriarchy set against the destructive chaos of a failing patriarchy, and a psychoanalytical investigation of national trauma and world war ii guilt, or is it an overlong, dull, self-important, incoherent mess, that in trying to be both feminist and feminine somehow ends up being both misogynist and misandrist? working kind of like a hybrid of nicholas winding refn's _the neon demon_ (2016) and darren aronofsky's _mother!_ (2017), the film is as far as you can get from guadagnino's more recent work, specifically _a bigger splash_ (2015), and _call me by your name_ (2017); one can only imagine what people who expected more of the warm sun and delicate eroticism seen in those films must have felt after spending 152 minutes in an arid berlin winter, witnessing bones pushing through skin, decapitations, night terrors, meat hooks being used in ways meat hooks were not intended to be used, holocaust survivors, political terrorism, and witches trying to organise an election.

set in ""divided berlin"" in october 1977, the film is divided into six acts (""1977"", ""palaces of tears"", ""borrowing"", ""taking"", ""in the mütterhaus (all the floors are darkness)"", and ""suspiriorum"") and an epilogue (""a sliced-up pear""). it begins with patricia hingle (chloë grace moretz, who appears to be cornering the market in rubbish hollywood remakes), a student at the prestigious helena markos tanzgruppe [helena markos dance academy] arriving at the home of her psychoanalyst, the carl jung-in-all-but-name dr. josef klemperer (tilda swinton, credited as lutz ebersdorf). terrified and not making much sense, hingle tells klemperer she has discovered something sinister about the academy and is now in fear for her life. although klemperer believes she is delusional, he is concerned for her well-being, but she flees, leaving behind her diary. meanwhile, susie bannion (dakota johnson), a mennonite from ohio, arrives at the academy hoping to audition. impressed with her abilities, lead choreographer madame blanc (also tilda swinton, channelling pina bausch), admits her to the academy. becoming close with her roommate, sara simms (an excellent mia goth), susie quickly finds herself dancing the lead in the academy's upcoming piece, _volk_. meanwhile, in hingle's diary, klemperer reads that the academy is a front for a witches' coven, and learns of the ""three mothers"", a triumvirate of powerful witches who predate christianity – suspiriorum (sighs), tenebrarum (darkness), and lachrymarum (tears). at the same time, he is trying to find out what happened to his wife, anke (jessica harper, who played susie in the original), who disappeared in 1944 after he tried to convince her it was safe to remain in berlin. meanwhile, the academy's matrons hold an election to choose the coven's leader, with blanc running against helena markos (also tilda swinton!), a vote which markos narrowly wins. unaware of any of this, as susie becomes increasingly close to blanc, sara grows suspicious of the matrons and begins to investigate on klemperer's behalf.

guadagnino has been obsessed with argento's original since he first saw it in 1984, and in 2007, he optioned the rights and hired david gordon green to write and direct a remake (there's that word again), something with which argento himself was not especially pleased, believing the film didn't need to be remade. in 2013, green revealed that legal issues had prevented the film from being made, and in 2014, he also cited the escalating budget. however, in 2015, guadagnino announced that he himself was now directing a ""_homage_"" (it's a remake), from a script by david kajganich (_the invasion_; _true story_) which focused on ""_the uncompromising force of motherhood._"" guadagnino's _suspiria_ is the kind of horror movie that goes for slow-burning psychological dread (there is literally not a single jump-scare), and from the time the project was announced, it has divided opinion, something which continued when it was released; it's that rarest of films whose metacritic scores range from 0 (for example, mike lasalle's review for the _san francisco chronicle_) to 100 (for example, joshua rothkopf's review for _time out_).

as the plot outline should make clear, the film deals with a variety of weighty themes, one of which is the political turmoil of the era. set in october 1977, the events of the _deutscher herbst_ [german autumn] are constantly on the fringes of the narrative – the film opens with a street demo; radio reports speak of ulrike meinhof's death in police custody in may 1976, the imprisonment of andreas baader and gudrun ensslin, the activities of the far-left, anti-imperialistic terrorist group _rote armee fraktion_ [red army faction - raf], the hijacking of _lufthansa flight 181_ by the popular front for the liberation of palestine, and the kidnapping of hanns martin schleyer; the story the academy put out to explain hingle's departure is that she has joined the raf; a bomb explodes off-camera.

and it is in relation to politics where we encounter the first, and most certainly not the last, of the film's problems. arguing that germany's failure to process their nazi past and confront their national shame is manifesting as political disenfranchisement, guadagnino employs a pseudo-jungian approach to show that the country's political turmoil runs parallel to the struggle for control of the coven. emphasising that the world of witches was once harmonious under the rule of the three mothers, just like germany, it has now devolved into factionalism, complete with backroom political manoeuvring, subterfuge within the ranks, and animosity bordering on aggression. within this dynamic, the matrons are the privileged ruling elite, and the students are the uneducated and disenfranchised ""_volk_"".

but to what end does guadagnino make this parallel? what is he trying to say? rarely have i encountered a narrative which employs such blatant yet inconclusive and vague political contextualisation. take the berlin wall as an example, which is literally right outside the academy's door. why is it there? why are there so many shots of it? what purpose does it serve in the narrative? the answer is, none. it's purely ornamental, with guadagnino seemingly hoping for meaning by association – people see the wall, and immediately begin to attribute to it all manner of allegorical significance, when in fact the film itself suggests nothing of the kind. and none of the other political symbols amount to much more; they certainly don't inform any grand thematic statement or political thesis. guadagnino bombards the viewer with empty historical and political themes which do nothing for the central storyline, functioning instead as decoration, utterly trivialising and completely disconnected.

also important in relation to the film's politics is _vergangenheitsbewältigung_ [""overcoming the past""] – essentially, post-1945 germany's attempt to come to terms with world war ii and the holocaust. this is primarily seen in klemperer's search for his wife, which throws up another problem. klemperer, who is not in argento's original, is a surrogate for the audience. nothing wrong with that, it's a standard screenwriting technique used to facilitate more organic exposition. however, klemperer is an extremely distracting and painfully on-the-nose device to afford guadagnino a vehicle for a political subplot, which is completely superfluous to what is happening in the coven. every single reference to anke could be removed from the film, leaving klemperer as simply an amateur detective trying to find out what happened to hingle, and the film would work just as well. in fact, it would work better. as his search for his wife becomes more prominent, and he becomes more central, all that is achieved is the waning of the central plot. in a story ostensibly about the feminine, it's rather troubling that the emotional core of the film is male. the film's preferred point of view is his, with even the epilogue focusing on him. klemperer is quite literally a man in a woman's world, but exactly why guadagnino felt the need to shoehorn a man into a story about women is anybody's guess.

which brings us to another theme; femininity (if not necessarily feminism). that the film is deeply interested in this is shown in a number of ways. for example, susie is told by head matron tanner (angela winkler) that the academy ensures the ""_financial autonomy of our girls_""; speaking of nazi germany, blanc says the regime wanted women to ""_close their minds and keep their uteruses open_""; susie is reminded that ""_before the war, germany had the strongest women_"". additionally, klemperer is played by swinton, meaning the film effectively has an all-female cast (the only other men with any lines are glockner and albrecht (played by mikael olsson and fred kelemen, respectively), two completely useless policemen whose main scene involves the witches hypnotising them and mocking the size of their genitalia). however, the film isn't interested in idealising female empowerment. instead, it depicts a matriarchy beset by disruption and the chaos of a struggle for power. as guadagnino tells jezebel,

> _if we talk about the great mother, we cannot deny the terrible mother. true feminism is something that doesn't shy away from the complexity of the female identity._

but does the film imply that a powerful group of women is something to be inherently feared? partly. indeed, the very theme of witchcraft itself (perhaps the purest historical manifestation of the patriarchy's fear of female agency) carries an undercurrent of misogyny, which is not helped by the nudity and repeated violent objectification of the female body. there's a very thin line between condemning the male gaze, which is what guadagnino claims to be doing, and recreating it, and it's a line which _suspiria_ frequently crosses (for an excellent example of a film which recreates the male gaze for the purpose of satirising and ridiculing it, see coralie fargeat's superb _revenge_). maybe the problem here is simply that a story inherently about matriarchy, female empowerment, and the importance of motherhood, is a story a man can't tell very well. i'm reminded of sofia coppola's remake of _the beguiled_ (2017), of which she argued,

> _this story had to be directed by a woman. the essence of it is feminine, it's seen from a female point of view._

_suspiria_ also has a feminine essence, but it doesn't have a female point of view, and one can't help but wonder what a talented female director like coppola, mary harron, patty jenkins, or the genius that is lynne ramsay would have made of this material.

however, even aside from these problems, there are a plethora of other issues. the character of blanc, for example, is poorly written, and is stripped of agency towards the end of the film, so by the time of the _dénouement_, she anti-climatically does little in the direction of either outright evil or redemptive good; instead, she just kind of hangs around. as for the matrons, apart from tanner, none receive an iota of characterisation; they are simply a jumble of non-individualised background extras. the same is true of the dancers. indeed, there's an absolute dearth of subjectivity or interiority for anyone beyond susie, blanc, klemperer, and, to a lesser extent, sara and tanner. there's a cliché-riddled scene showing blanc telepathically channelling nightmares to susie, full of images of skulls, worms, rotting flesh, etc. nothing we haven't seen a hundred times before. finally, the film is immensely silly in places. for example, the much-talked-about climax is presided over by what can only be described as a female jabba the hut wearing sunglasses. another example is after susie first dances at the academy, she confides to blanc, ""_it felt like what i think it must feel like to fuck._"" ""_do you mean fuck a man?_"" asks blanc. ""_no_,"" replies susie, ""_i was thinking of an animal._"" of course you were.

from an aesthetic point of view, however, there's a great deal to admire, as one would expect from guadagnino, who is working with much of the same crew as from his last couple of films. walter fasano's editing is wonderfully disjointed, often cutting maniacally between inserts, barely affording the viewer time to register the images. the compositions and camera placement of cinematographer sayombhu mukdeeprom (_uncle boonmee who can recall his past lives_) are also fascinating, often putting the camera in such a position as to purposely give a less than perfect view of a particular space. combined, these two techniques are disorientating and frequently defamiliarising, rendering mundane geographical spaces such as offices, dorm rooms, and rehearsal studios as foreboding and unknowable, almost protean, never allowing the viewer to forget that something is not quite right in this _milieu_. contributing to this sense is the blocking, particularly the recurring motif of staging conversations so that one character is off-screen, only visible to the audience via reflection. especially noticeable is the film's colour, or lack thereof. whereas argento's original was awash in garish and exaggerated reds, purples, blues, greens, and yellows, guadagnino's remake was conceived as ""_winterish_"", with as limited a use of primary colours as possible; grey, beige, and brown predominate. giulia piersanti's costumes are also superb, with susie's wardrobe noticeably changing from conservative dresses and sweatpants to more revealing tank tops and shorts as she gains in confidence. thom yorke's krautrock-style score is also excellent, as different from goblin's prog-rock music from the original as you could possibly imagine.

the cumulative tension and dread are also reasonably well managed in the first half of the film, and there are individual scenes of great brilliance. at one point, sara goes snooping around the academy, finding something genuinely shocking, the reveal of which is masterfully staged by guadagnino and mukdeeprom. easily the best scene in the film is the one that so traumatised audiences at cinemacon 2018. as susie performs an especially energetic dance for blanc in one room, unbeknownst to her, she is psychically linked to a dancer in another, and every movement of her body is manifested violently in the other room, with the other dancer being flung about like a rag doll. the scene is horrifically gruesome, with bones piercing through flesh, blood and urine flowing copiously, and limbs contorting into truly disturbing positions. what really sells the scene, however, is the combination of fasano's brilliant intercutting (maintaining continuity of movement from room to room cannot have been easy), damien jalet's superb choreography, and the disturbing sound design by frank kruse and markus stemler (_cloud atlas_; _in the heart of the sea_; _assassin's creed_) contrasting the sharp snapping of breaking bones with the wetter sounds of those bones penetrating flesh.

self-indulgent like little else i can think of, _suspiria_ is absolutely convinced of its own profundity. far, far too long and far too self-serious, its themes and messages are poorly iterated, it's insanely dull for long periods, and it's badly unfocused. it's almost an hour longer than the original, and, honestly, it uses that hour to say precisely nothing of interest. the simple fact is that the slight story at the film's core (a coven of witches using a dance academy as a front) is unable to bear the massive weight of themes and narrative diversions heaped upon it; the vehicle just can't carry the message. its politics are no more insightful than tabloid headlines, and serve only to detract from what is supposed to be the narrative's focus. ultimately, it has little to say about femininity, feminism, political protest, the holocaust, cold war germany, or world war ii guilt, but it damn sure works hard to convince us it has a great deal to say about such topics. as cold as the berlin winter it depicts, _suspiria_ is equal parts emotionless, mechanical, and dull.",low
5511,this movie is an abomination. i truly wish this hadn’t been labelled a remake and had just been something new that was inspired by suspiria or something. imagine taking the most beautiful movie in the world and being like why don’t i make this ugly as hell. it’s also ridiculously long. one of my most hated movies.,low
5512,"inspite of argento's dissatisfaction, suspiria (by guadagnino) is an evocative reinterpretation. maybe it is the original creator's prerogative to criticize the execution when remaking classic cinema, peronally, i find the criticism also takes itself too seriously.

reimagination through the milieu (post-war germany) affords a shift in depth and focus without complicating the narrative with self-referentiality. although details have been torn apart for lack of relevance, to my mind,  if the director chose any setting, naivety or irrelevance would still be the low-hanging fruit of critics. the film simply doesn't strive to show a connection, and contextual elements are illustrated with proportionate gravity and relevance.

if one has to draw comparisons, there are diametric opposites in many ways. mainly through through cinematography. no doubt argento's inspired so much that followed and this ultimately binds it to the genre it inspired. four decades later, we have a histrionic period drama fused with a supernatural fable forming (unwanted) homage to argento's suspense, as cinema for today's audience.

i loved the original score by goblin and others they did for argento and romero. the selective moods created by thom yorke, incidentally harmonic vocals and creepy piano motifs fit. visual stylistic references to argento are the use of light, costume and retro decor which jarrs to effect but again, is not out of place.

in terms of conceptual themes, i think it did well. perhaps it is not something that everyone will he happy with. then again, it's not trying to please everyone nor explain connections between a timeless demonic coven in post-war germany. let it wash over you and you might feel its crestfallen tones and realism.",high

5514,"**a movie as empty as a haunted house.**

i fully understand the fascination with winchester mystery house, an old mansion that was born from sarah winchester's will and ideas: owner of a fortune linked to the firearm's industry, she thought she was being haunted by the ghosts of people killed by these weapons and was advised by a medium to live in a mansion that was always being remodeled, with rooms and divisions permanently being added or demolished in an apparently random way. sarah winchester truly believed that she would be killed if she stopped or finished the building, so the house was only completed (obviously unended) with her death, and then opened to the public as a tourist attraction. it's a fascinating, curious and bizarre story, but it took a long time to reach the cinema.

the movie, however, is not remarkable, being just another ghost story in a haunted house. the spierig brothers (directors and writers) do not bring anything new to their film, limiting themselves to using almost all the regular clichés of american horror, including static and scary images that appear out of nowhere (at quite predictable moments) for the usual jump scares. as a haunted house horror movie, i've seen better.

one of the biggest problems of the film is the poor script and the bad conception of the characters. the two brothers who wrote the script were so enamored with the mysterious house that they weren't able to create a really intriguing story around it, and its original inhabitant. everything goes reasonably well from the point where the doctor arrives at the mansion, but the preceding story, which justifies his trip and stay at the place, is very far-fetched. on the other hand, the melodramatic twist at the end, involving the doctor and a ghost from his past, was predictable from the beginning and is very nauseating. poorly written and almost without personality, the characters just appear, talk and disappear without our caring about them. and as if the truth were not enough to make us believe in the possible curse of the winchester family, the script got a completely made up story for marion marriott, niece (and heiress) of the manor owner. she existed in real life, but her life wasn't what the movie says, and her husband didn't die as it is said. it is a pointless and unnecessary invention.

the cast has a handful of familiar names, but maybe they don't really want to be remembered for the work they've done here. in fact, the cast effort is reduced, and the prevailing feeling is that the actors were not really committed or motivated. if helen mirren is the most seasoned and famous actress in the cast, the truth is that she is never really there, in body and mind. she seems oblivious, or uninterested. jason clarke still seems to have some interest in what he's doing, and i felt the actor tried to do something positive, but he won't have had much of an opportunity to go beyond what he's done.

the film is not a technical brilliance. there have been attempts to film in the original house, but we are told that the very design of the house, with cramped spaces and low light, will not be ideal for movie shooting. personally, i also believe that the organization that is managing the property has shown some reluctance to allow it, since they have always had, until today, great restraint in allowing the capture of images of the interior of the house. everything that was recreated in the studio seems to me to be very well done, and i liked the sets and the house. however, the production values ​​basically stop here… the cinematography is pretty basic and the editing is banal, but it manages to give the film a pace that isn't tiresome. the props and period details look convincing, but the cgi is poor, the digitally made images are of very poor quality, and the visual and sound effects seem cheap and elementary.",low

5521,"damien chazelle has already proven himself to be one of the freshest new directors of the decade so far. even after delivering the hard-hitting whiplash and the emotionally-wrecking and whimsical la la land, he still knows how to surprise fans of his work, returning to the silver screen with grace. combining every element of his previous outings that made him a household name, chazelle makes sure the audience feels every ounce of power that he's thrown into his latest directorial effort. oddly enough, it's his first foray into biopic territory, a zone where many revered filmmakers have failed to capture the reality of the moment they're attempting to bring to life.

going in, you'll already know how the movie ends, which is the problem most directors encounter when making a biopic. finding a way to transfer the actuality of the moment while still feeling original and never appearing boring is a hard task that very few have been able to truly accomplish. with first man, chazelle manages to land a spot on that list of directors, and for good reason. he keeps true to the true story with a film that's so intense and fully realized that you might forget that it actually happened.

space movies have always been a highlight of cinema. from georges méliès' 1902 silent film a trip to the moon and stanley kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey to the star wars and alien franchises, films taking place in the farthest reaches of the universe prove to be some of the most intriguing and original creations brought to viewers' eyes (even by today's standards). it's the true stories that really prove to be some of the most effective, however. sure, fictional ones show us what could be possible; but it's the depictions of true events that show us what was possible, creating a harrowing story of patriotism in the process.

from a technical perspective, first man is a marvel on all fronts. linus sandgren, the cinematographer who won an academy award for his work on la la land, returns to collaborate with chazelle and once again delivers a grand spectacle that should not be missed out on while in theaters. the cinematography is stunning. hues of yellow and blue pop, lighting a path towards the characters and showing no sign of stopping once they've started. certain scenes are given an extra boost from the home-video-style camerawork, beautifully grainy and shaky in all of the right ways.

justin hurwitz (chazelle's roommate in college), another frequent collaborator, also returns to score the film and knocks it out of the park as expected. hurwitz obviously knows how to write music, but its how his compositions fit in with the scenes and themes they're tied to that make them so worthwhile. hurwitz invests you in the midst of all the chaos with all of the orchestral beauty surrounding his pieces. that's the thing about his scores, though: it's hard to objectively rank them because of how different they all are. chazelle is a unique director because he never sticks to the same formula over an over again, and the same can be said for the accompanying music for each of them.

acting is on point here; ryan gosling hits a huge emotional nerve with incredibly investing performance as neil armstrong. he keeps to himself (namely, his personal life) but is willing to risk it all for the mission. nothing from gosling is single-layered; everything is complex and detailed to the point that you might as well be in the room with him.

claire foy also delivers an amazing portrayal as janet armstrong, neil's wife. foy topples every housewife stereotype that embodied this specific time period, giving a strong, contained, and free-willed performance of a woman who is certainly not afraid to share her thoughts on issues concerning her husband.

the flag controversy is totally stupid. the moon landing scene doesn't need the image of armstrong planting the flag on the moon to dish up a heavily emotional response from the audience. if you get a chance to screen it in imax, definitely do. the expanded aspect ratio only comes into play during this specific scene but it is utterly transfixing.

first man is one of the best films of the year, no doubt about it. every shot is perfection. every sound is excellence. there is no comparison to what damien chazelle and co. have accomplished here; even iconic films like apollo 13 can't live up to the new bar of quality chazelle has set for the space drama subgenre. a harrowing journey from start-to-finish, and a true masterwork in many respects, first man is one film that delivers upon its promise and then some. performances and technicalities are perfect, but that's what chazelle will continue to be known for: perfection.",high

for an origin story, it was fun...but with venom being one of the best known spidey characters, and with spidey being one of the best known comic book characters...was an origin story necessary? especially one that was going to change so much of the character?

it could have easily started off after the origin and rolled along on its way as to not irk the fans of the comics.

despite all of that, it was a well balanced mix of amusing and dark, and those combinations usually tend to work...even if it didn't have the blood that gore that would have sent the film over the top in best possible way.

5550,"as a video game to movie adaptation tomb raider works on nearly every level, the only flaw being that there's so much of tomb raider to pack into two hours.
i had great expectations for this film and wasn't disappointed in the least. on the contrary, it was a blast from beginning to end with alicia vikander lending a nice touch of innocence to lara, which is a clear nod to the 2013 game reboot which is what the film is based on.
her tortuous relationship with her dad was predictable, but it wasn't overdone and it's a key element in the lara story. on the other hand, we're plunged into the action right away and in that respect i was more than happy as the scenes were both exciting and typically lara croft. she uses keys, there are puzzles, traps,maps, evil foes and magnificent set pieces that, if you've ever played the games, will be instantly recognisable as tomb raider.
much as has been said about the last two games perhaps giving a conflicted projection of lara croft - on the one hand a tormented soul and on the other, a ruthless killing machine. in all the games, she always killed the foes just to survive and the balance was just right here, with alicia vikander lending just the right amount of steely determination to the role.

5556,"it’s a bitter irony that 12 strong was released only three years before kabul fell faster than kevin spacey’s career. then again, this movie has as much to do with the war in afghanistan as the arab uprising has to do with lawrence of arabia — which is exactly where director nicolai fuglsig and screenwriters ted tally and peter craig seem to have gotten their idea of general dostum (navid negahban), whom they have filtered through george c. scott's patton, and given a historical hero upgrade.

generally speaking, the film lives in its very own fantasy world. granted, most movies take liberties, but what 12 strong does is more akin to libertinage. it purports to depict ""one of the us military's most stunning achievements,"" which al quaeda ""considers ... to be their worst defeat.""

the former... sure, why not? as for the latter, though, al quaeda may or may not consider it its ""worst defeat,"" but even if they did, methinks they wouldn’t be caught dead admitting it, so the question is, who exactly is your source?

furthermore, we learn that the real-life general dostum and captain mitch nelson (chris hemsworth) ""remain close friends to this day"" — which means that you’re never too old to have an imaginary friend, what with mitch nelson being a fictional character and all (based on green beret commander mark nutsch, who i assume had the good sense to not want to be associated with this dumpster fire).",low

but it was really nice seeing jamie lee curtis back, and nice in the ""it doesn't really feel like a halloween movie without her in it"" kind of way.

unfortunately that isn't enough to save the film, nor is the added over-the-top blood and gore that didn't really need a place in the first two movies.

but...the blood and gore seemed to replace real scares (though there were a couple) as if to say, yeah, they understand that they aren't making this horror movie frightening, so they might as well make it bloodier and hope that it's a decent trade off for actual scares.

the main issue, however, is that it is spread thin. it's like it was written in committee where everyone that there little plot be added to the film despite how difficult that would make actual story telling.

the results are so many tiny little subplots that you end up not even caring about the main plot as they try to cram them all into the same hole. you end up just not caring at all about any of it.

and then the characters shoved into the movie to accommodate the extra plot lines are just as thin and under-developed that it's really hard to care about what happens to them as well.

in the end there is so much going on that it never really focuses enough on anything to keep the audience emotionally invested and really you end up only caring about jamie because she won you over in the first two good films and that kind of holds you just enough to actually finish a film.

if she weren't cast in it, even her character would be hard to relate to in any way.

it makes you want to take the director by the collar and yell ""focus!"" with the hopes that it would drop all the unnecessary story lines and just deal with what matters.

the world is a fairly dark post apocalyptic world where moving predator cities prays on each other. the entire concept is really quite ridiculous of course but it makes for some really fantastic and spectacular special effects and i am a sucker for spectacular special effects.

in addition the overall story holds together fairly well. that is, in the context of the ludicrous world that is the background of this story in the first place of course. it is quite straightforward without too much annoying social or green preaching that plagues so many movies nowadays. somewhat predictable but overall a good vehicle for the plentiful action.

i also liked most of the characters. both the bad guy and the good guys had decent charisma with the exception of tom who was a bit of a naive whiner although he got it together towards the end.

there where  few flaws. nothing really major except that, in one scene at the end, the city of london was shown against the wall and it was bloody tiny compared to the wall. the main bad guy’s last resort was to pummel london against the wall and was expected to break it down. before in the movie london was depicted as really huge. that scene really screwed that and made him delusional.

apart from that, end tom’s whining and naivety, i really liked this movie. it was the kind of over the top, fantasy/fiction movie with a big budget that you do not see every day. of course the dickwads, a.ka “critics”) at rotten tomatoes and other mainstream media assholes did their best to tell everyone how bad it was. as usual that’s just the stuff that comes out of the south end of a north bound bull.",high

but that is the new trend isn't it? that is the new hollywood formula.

don't worry though. if you have the skills you may end up on top. just like ben mendelsohn's slave-owning antagonist almost did. because in this story, it's not a world where anyone feels compassion or empathy. it's a world where everyone only thinks of themselves. a sociopath's dream. and that's what earns the top prize.

as a computer nerd and science fiction geek this movie was of course right up my alley. i have thought other movies would be my kind of movies before but been sorely disappointed by ignorant and incompetent screen writers and directors trying to cash in on subjects that they knew absolutely nothing about. spielberg did a good job of not screwing this one up.

the core of this movie is of course plenty of action and computer generated special effects with a somewhat apocalyptic story to bind everything together. the story works but it is not really anything special and some of the stuff, like the loyalty centers, was frankly a bit silly. but, as i wrote, it works and does not get in the way so that’s good enough for me.

as the previously mentioned nerd and geek i absolutely loved the abundant references to science fiction, fantasy and gaming history and lore. for me those were soo cool. i will probably watch the movie again just to focus on the background and see how much stuff i can spot. stuff that i missed when watching the movie the first time.

the cgi effects and the action was also pretty awesome. the movie starts off right away with a great and absolutely insanely wild car race and continues to go strong from there. the battle at doom castle at the end is just epic.

the only thing that made me go wtf was at the end [spoiler ahead] were mr asswipe sorrento finally catches up with the high five’s van and the he just freezes and looks at wade with a silly look on his face. what the fuck was that? just stupid for no good reason.

5647,"this is a review reprinted from moviecrypt by kevin ranson 

""  hardboiled detectives, femme fatales, and a mandatory macguffin are all part of the tradition we call film noir. “guns, dames, and hats” are the order of the day in these brooding period pieces, a bygone era of hollywood like westerns and musicals. there have been the occasional callbacks with films like l.a. confidential, sin city, and even the original blade runner repurposing it as a vision of the future — a detail mostly missing from the recent sequel. all of these undertakings require extensive budgets, finding or recreating the trappings and props of the time period, and to develop the visuals required to invoke the all-important atmosphere that defines the film style. rarely are the words “independent” and “noir” uttered in reference to a feature-length film intended to celebrate and champion a new entry into this staple of the movie industry, but with the right combination of players, passion, and just long enough of a shoestring to fish spare change out of the sewer, can a compelling dark thriller become the end result?

as evidenced by trouble is my business, the answer is a resounding “yes.” less a passion project than a labor of love, writer-director-actor thomas konkle gathered the necessary ingredients and managed to draw forth a film by sheer force of will. with years involved in the writing, planning, independent and personal financing, and using every movie-making trick imaginable, trouble is to film noir what once upon a time in the west was to the western: the final word. with classic elements, a fresh cast, and painstaking detail, konkle has created a world both familiar and new. twists, betrayal, and mystery are finely intertwined with the wit, violence, and eventuality of the genre.

locations are important to a production like this, but what couldn’t be found and rented had to be created — often digitally. while sky captain and the world of tomorrow buckled under the weight of “look what we can do,” konkle puts his players in the foreground and allowed the story to dictate the effects, not the other way around. with talents like jordana capra as matriarch evelyn montemar and vernon wells as detective barry tate, the production is nearly seemless and perhaps too-real in its detail, from meticulous editing to a sweeping soundtrack. it’s clear what the filmmakers wanted this to become, and the time put into the post production shows what can be done with today’s off-the-shelf filmmaking tools and the ingenuity of modern creators.

over the last five years, this reviewer has seen several independent productions shaped from concept to completion. from an old-time rocket ship carrying space rangers into the great beyond to a backwoods werewolf reneging on his deal with the devil, there’s no shortage of imagination out there while hollywood continues to reboot television and movie franchises they never understood to begin with. trouble sets itself apart in both ambition and execution, and the risk yielded a great reward: a film deserving to be seen and appreciated.""

5654,"well, i guess the good new is that you don't have to worry at all. it is not historically accurate, and by that i mean it falls under the title of ""revisionist."" normally i don't care if a film is historically accurate, i understand it is hollywood...but i do care if it is a total re-write of history.

this is a rewrite, it is so far from accurate that it is a clear attempt to change people's knoweldge of the historical figures and the era.

but, the good news is that where is lacks in historical correctness it more than makes up for in political correctness. and that might be at the route of why it veers so far from depicting actual real life events. it's focus was elsewhere, it's focus was on appeasing the people that support censorship and wish nothing more than to revise history to suit their political agenda.

we found the plot to be continuously engaging and full of laughs. there was one scene that made us lose it and laugh like we haven’t done for a movie since the burning dog scene in there’s something about mary. i won’t give it away, but will just mention to pay attention when they introduce the squeaky toy.

danny glover is the only down side and, honestly it's not because he didn't do a good job, he was lovable, believable, realistic, and maddeningly under-utilized. he leaves you wanting to see more, and unfortunately you never get it.

but, of course, the best of the best are robert redford and sissy spacek who manage to take a film about elderly bank robbers and turn it into a charming love story.

the strength is the casting. everyone did a great job, but there are three highlights i feel the need to specifically praise:

jake johnson plays the best perpetual stoner friend i've seen since brad pitt in true romance. he's both relatable and completely exaggerated, and he pulls both off with ease.

isla fisher was, well, the best way to describe her is: ""consistently hysterical."" she was so aggressively over-the-top that her scenes were a delight to watch. she was able to capture a specific personality trait of a certain type of person everyone knows, and then believably exaggerate it to hysterical proportions. she delivered what was probably the best comedic performance in 2018.

and jeremy renner was able to play the aloof living mcguffin perfectly straight and believable no matter how absurd his scenes were. they say comedy is best delivered straight and he proves the statement true and adds a graceful timing to his performance.

unfortunately it's not going to be remembered, but it might be a cult classic if for no other reason that the characters were perfectly cast for their individual roles.

ultimately, when all is said and done, tag will make you laugh, and that really was the point of both making the film and watching the film. in my book that's a success.",high

by synopsis, dominika egorova (jennifer lawrence) it's a professional ballet ballerina that tragically forced to change her career path by an ""accident"".

moved by her family needs, she's accept some ""business"" propositions that subsequent convert her into an sparrow, a secret government physiologic weapon of seduction.

i think i disagree with some people in believing that stan & ollie benefits from narrowing the plot. showing their career together at their pear would show what they were as a team and what they did together, but this angle illustrates who they are. it sweats the details. coogan and reilly are very convincing in their roles.

they still have ambitions that fuel an attempt at a comeback, but their ambition is clouded by the knowledge that they are past their prime. they enjoy the nostalgia and leftover love from their fans even while they try to rise above it. the movie is able to end on a high note even though they cannot achieve all of their goals. 

perhaps what i like the most about this movie is the treatment of the stars' wives. as the agent character states, the two wives are also a sort of double act. on the surface they don't seem to like each other a lot, but we see moments of respect and fun between them, and they obviously both love their famous husbands very much. as i said above, coogan and reilly do a great job in this movie, but it would have been a lesser film without these two supporting characters.",high

there is a lot that is praise worthy here, but what wowed me the most was how well a cartoon movie could be a period piece of pop art.

it really fit the era right down to the faces and hair, not to mention all the other tiny little details.

starting with han growing up as a youth on corellia, we see how each aspect of his character comes into being. each. aspect. even how he gets the name solo. i mean, seriously! they create a checklist, from his relationships to chewie and lando, right down to his blaster, and shows how each one comes to pass or be in his possession.

it’s actually kind of...well, sad. it turns out that every iconic aspect of this character we’ve loved all sprang out of one single caper in his career. talk about peaking early! they even recreate some famous scenes, but they’re still the same scenes just with a new coat of paint. and paint is a very apt metaphor. “solo” is very much a paint by numbers star wars film. no surprises. purely for fans, and even then there’s some issues. even the cameo at the end felt ridiculously overdone. star wars fatigue definitely seems to be setting in. still, as a star wars fan, i’m probably being more forgiving even though i rate this movie as just “okay.”",low

5706,"a crushing disappointment.

the hopes were high for this latest predator rebirth, not because shane black starred in the great first predator film, so therefore he surely must care about the project? but because he's an excellent writer and director. shane black can count lethal weapon(s), the last boy scout and the long kiss goodnight on his cv, he was the man who put iron man back on track after the sag of part 2. plus he is the creator of two of the best buddy buddy neo-noirs this millennium (kiss kiss bang bang/the nice guys), so how come the predator stinks of lazy cash cow manure?

plot in a nutshell sees the universe's most lethal hunters unleashed on earth due to the meddling of a soldiers kid and some nosey scientist types. the fate of mankind rests with a group of damaged ex-soldiers and a rather cheesed off female scientist.

we have a rehash mishmash of what we have seen before in predator 87 and predators 2010. a group dynamic fighting a seemingly invincible foe. the subsequent science aspects such as human dna inference/reasoning etc never really add up to much, serving only for a bunch of standard actors shouting, swearing and spouting hopelessly weak jokes and series re-treads. when you think the pic is about to up a gear, get rivetingly dramatic, a poor slice of humour comes our way either by vocal spillage or visual drivel (puppy pet predator dog, really?). there's a bunch of plot threads that just dangle never to be pulled (ptsd/our hero's family strife et al), and the predators loose on earth - with different agendas - are confusingly shifted about by a screenplay not sure where it wants to land. 

plus points? well the cinematography is superb (larry fong), and you can't fault this for action quotas, there's plenty of it and it's bloody (both red and green type). the score is the traditional one we had from alan silvestri back in the 87 film, in fact it hardly deviates from it and yet henry jackman gets the credit. of course some of the jokes will work for some folk (i would be lying if i said a whoopi goldberg gag didn't make me laugh), but the terror has gone, these predators are no longer scary creatures. this reeks of a troubled production going hand in hand with a cash cow that not only narratively adds up to nothing really, but of a franchise death knell. shame. 3.5/10",low
5708,"full disclosure, i've only really seen the first two movies, and after that i ignored the franchise. when the 2010 film dropped, it didn't even hit my radar and none of the crossovers with aliens i even bothered with...

...but by 2010 i was 30 and, honestly, these are rated ""r"" movies that i loved in my childhood. but that was the 80s when parents could take their children to bloody rated r movies and not be arrested for abuse.

so, when they started making more, as much as i loved the first one, i really didn't care too much about the series. they lost me at the sequel.

but 2018 rolled around and i was feeling nostalgic. i wanted a throw back to a simpler time when people weren't so high strung about everything including the movies. why not give it a try.

and, i loved predator as a kid even though it was clearly an adult movie. but you get the feeling that this one was a rated r movie clearly made for children.

i remember moments of levity in the first few...but i don't recall them being light and, almost whimsical at all. they were serious sci-fi horror films.

this comes across as a marvel movie, and though i love marvel movies i don't want a predator movie to feel like the avengers. it's the predator, it is supposed to have a different tone.

it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. it was too light to be a predator movie. it wasn't dark. it wasn't scary, and it had too much of an attempt at humor to enjoy.

it would have worked in a novel, but in a screen play it just made it a bit messy and loose. and, unfortunately, that is what the critics are going to focus on. but then, j.k. is a novelist and it got a bit lost in translation from one writing style to another.

but, beyond that you have a wonderful cast and the film as a whole is delightfully fun.

eddie redmayne is once more the lead, and he does a decent job...but what is better is how generous both johnny depp and jude law were in the film. each have, in their day, stolen a show or two. they are both fully capable of stealing the spotlight...but instead they took a step back rather than hogging any of the limelight and, as a result, it allowed for everyone involved to deliver a solid performance.

it could have easily gone the way of a russel crowe film with law and depp involved...however they didn't do the crowe-hog and because of that the film ended up with more balance than it should have with the unnecessary plot turn.

in other-words, they helped bring it back from being truly over blown.

so what do you get? you get to walk into the weird world of harry potter again, and that is always fun. you get adventure and mystery and, again, that is always fun. you get decent performances and a solid (if bloated plot) and you walk away entertained.

it's worth viewing even if it is unbalanced. it's still entertaining and fun and, after all, that is the point of making a movie.",high

despite knowing practically little about the mcu up until a few weeks ago, i still knew this was a film that was going to see - so to speak - excrement hit the fan... and boy did it! it's a great ride.

like <em>'captain america: civil war'</em> did, <em>'avengers: infinity war'</em> does an incredible job at juggling the gargantuan number of characters. it's ridiculous, but totally awesome, how many faces we see appear again. i thought they got the screen time for all, more or less, down to a t. not an easy job, that.

speaking of the cast, it's robert downey jr., chris hemsworth and josh brolin who stand out most in my memory. them three are excellent, especially the latter. away from those lot, it's very cool to see all the other worlds - including from <em>'doctor strange'</em> and <em>'guardians of the galaxy'</em> - come together into one film. as for new additions, there aren't many - peter dinklage being the pick.

there are many references that i had already become aware of just via the internet, so it was quite amusing seeing them all unfold here and there. the effects looked great to me, as they have basically all the way up until this point of the mcu. the comedy is good again, also.

needless to say, i can't wait to see <em>'avengers: endgame'</em>!",high

seriously, they did a good enough job. they focused on gomorrah, thor, and strange and stark enough to make a plot despite the insane amount of characters. and the rest they used as filler, with only the vision story coming up a bit light due to population.

and the vision story was a bit of a draw back. it was there but it wasn't, but at least it was there, it was important, but it seemed tertiary and a little too much so.

the humor was also scaled back. but spider man did a good job, cap had a few and laughs,and yet again, it was only panther and the wakandans that took themselves too seriously to be in a marvel movie.

i'm sorry, someone really needs to tell the mcu that it is fine if the black panther cracks a smile or a one-line once or twice. we won't mind.

the tone was more action than action/comedy...but with ""war"" in the title, you kind of expect that.

however, they do not even address the elephant in the room...why did widow go blond? was it to have more fun or was it simply because she was on the run. the world may never know.

i do however think the subtitles didn't help the box office showing at all, but added to the realism of the film over all.

kodi smit-mcphee though, he was able to carry the film while looking strikingly like juliette lewis, and, in some cases, moving like her. it was a bit of a distraction, especially when the men and women really needed to look more rawhide...a lot more rawhide.

despite that, it was a compelling film, despite some of the cgi issues. it drew you in and actually felt like a trip in the wayback machine much more than 10,000 bc could have even dreamed of doing.

darker i gave 1 out of 10, because the plot line that it bills itself as following takes all of 5 minutes, gets resolved in the middle of the film, never comes up again, and has little sex (which is the reason why people see these things).

this one i am giving 1 of 10 stars.

there is actually less sex than in the sequel and far less than in the original...but look at the picture up here on imdb, look at all the posters...it was marketed as a film about sex and there really wasn't that much. you see more in a single episode of an hbo series.

and the plot, again quoting imdb:

""anastasia and christian get married, but jack hyde continues to threaten their relationship""

like with darker, that all happens in the blink of an eye. you sneeze and you'll miss the bulk of the plot. and the sex (the reason why people actually watch this film) doesn't even serve as filler.

so what you are left with is anastasia and christian sitting around, not having sex, trying to figure out how to fill the rest of the film. it's like watching linoleum curl on a hot day.

 this is also not an ordinary animated movie. it has animated style we have never seen before. there were 177 animators and it took 1 week to animate 1 second and 1 year to nail down 10 seconds. nowadays, animations are being made to look real but this movie was different. however, the creators wanted it to look like something new for viewers. they don't make it realistic or cartoon. the creators used an old-school technique called ""smear"". if you look in a single frame, you'll notice things like multiple limbs to create the illusion of movement. basically, the entire movie was a comic book that moves. there is a technique in half-toning, which uses dots to create colors and gradients. they were really jaw-dropping. the shadows were created with hatching or crisscrossed lines. the movie had some textures so it would be exactly like a comic and i was glad that it deserved oscars's best animated feature. all of these techniques combined to make a movie that was the best animated feature not just in 2018 but perhaps of all time. it was really like a masterpiece of animation!
 the story plot was really good. the scenes were quite epic and sometimes tragic and hilarious. the unbelievable thing was when peter parker died in miles' dimension. it was really sad to see an iconic superhero killed by a supervillain. the deaths are moving and the hilarious scenes kept me laugh a lot. i like the end-credits when it started in the animated tv show spider-man (1966) when the two spider-men look exactly like each other arguing, but this time, it was spider-man pointing to spider-man 2099. how did they do that? perhaps the best moment to me was “a leap of faith” when miles tried to be the one and only spider-man in his dimension, after peter parker was dead.
i wasn't bored watching this movie, it kept my eyes open on the screen looking at the newest kind of animation. i was totally impressed! perhaps this is the greatest animated movie of alll time! it was a really good idea to release this on christmas!",high

hard to hate a movie when you know so much love and care was put into it.

the superhero genre can feel tedious at times, especially to anyone who may not have had a strong childhood connection to these characters. most of the movies in this category are retreads of the same old coming-into-superpowers narratives played over and over again, just set in different places and populated with different casts of characters. every once in a while, though, a movie comes out and reinvigorates the genre. the animated _spider-man: into the spider-verse_ has done exactly that.",high
5828,"i'll be upfront, i'm giving this 1 star because of the treatment of peter parker.

they didn't do the andrew garfield thing and turn him into a bully. but they did do that modern marvel comics thing and turn him into an idiot screw-up in an effort to alienate the fans and somehow make miles better by mocking peter.

and i'm not a fan of that. parker is a dork, he's got a smart mouth...but he's really smart, a genius, totally heroic, and well, the call him ""the friendly neighborhood spider-man"" for a reason. he cares, specifically he cares about the average working schulb.

this kind of just took peter parker and almost mocked him and, honestly, i can't get behind that. i couldn't get behind it when they turned him into a bully in the garfield movies, and i don't care for it when they mock him here.",low
5829,"well, it's so inaccurate that you can tell from the start that it is going for statement over biopic.

and it almost seems like it should be titled ""the unstoppable rbg"" as she comes across as right all the time, faultless, stronger, smarter and more capable than anyone to the point where she can argue a case, preform brain surgery, and create the rocket that got us to the moon, in a single night without breaking a sweat.

she's more perfect here than mary poppins and it makes the film sort of unbelievable. ginsburg is human, i'm sure she had to struggle to over come more than just the evil white male patriarchy, but even that she effortlessly dismantles.

halfway through the movie you expect her to wear a cape and fly away, just to prove she can out super superman as well.

in a biopic you kind of expect to get to know the character, to see their ups and downs. instead, however, what you get is a golden god with history rewritten to add a healthy polish.",low

5839,"a dazzling sci-fi epic that holds nothing back in its entirety. claire denis' vision is an unrelenting masterwork packed to the brim with nerve-shredding fear and and a pulse-punding gravitational pull that sucks in the viewer and never lets go until the very end.

i found this film more of a meditation on what makes humanity's backbone so spontaneous; there are many plot points and elements that seem justified by the notion that humans are unpredictable creatures and as we evolve, we'll continue to be more and more focused on following through with our own morals. there's lots of brutality on display on this film and it all feels very contained until one moment near the film's middle that's very quiet and equally contained but that sends the entirety of the cast into chaos. it's almost a testament to the question of whether authority figures actually *do* something for prisoners or instead just make their rage build up further and further until it explodes harder than a dick in the fuckbox.

i think the best way its themes can be described is by a quote from the film itself: ""the sensation, moving backwards, even though we're moving forwards, getting further from what's getting nearer."". the way it presents human evolution as moving forward literally but moving backward metaphorically is more than just smart: it's genius. but the film also tackles issues pertaining to erotic pleasure and abuse of that pleasure; the entire fuckbox scene is just a nightmare on all levels and it made me want to just die from the shivers it sent down my spine.

i highly recommend supporting this film it's playing near you, very few people will end up getting to experience it in theaters (i sure didn't) so please don't ensure that another beautiful masterpiece gets slept on!",high

5843,i felt embarrassed to be watching this. it's an embarrassing fever dream. i abandoned it halfway through its runtime.,low
5848,"brain hurt. me no likey. err...umm...ahem.

this is a movie that really stretches it as far as believability, logic, or even physics.

first, just a quick note: the trailer makes it seem like the movie spends its time on an island about to blow up. less than half the movie is that. so, if you're looking for a long drawn out volcanic eruption, look elsewhere.

the heroes are annoying and dumb caricatures, from the techie who's afraid of everything to the wisecracking animal wrangler (in fairness, this is chris pratt's character from the previous film, but still). the villains are short-sighted, moustache-twirling dolts who never seem to remember to watch behind them, especially in dangerous scenarios. and why was jeff goldblum even in this movie? he serves no purpose to the story. none at all. he's there for them to say, ""see! we have someone from the older movies, so it ties together."" that's literally all he's there to do for his two minutes of screen time.

it's the same plot as every other jurassic park/world film. let's create/genetically engineer dinosaurs. what could possibly go wrong? even the supposed ""plot twist"" could be figured out from the very beginning of the film. basic physics don't even apply, such as the impossible truck jump at one point. i swear i could feel my brain leaking out of my ears while watching this.

this film honestly makes me somewhat relieved that colin trevorrow got removed from star wars episode ix. unfortunately, the way this movie ends basically guarantees that there's going to be another one. although it begs the question about what happened to jurassic park iii since it ends in a similar way. is that film even supposed to be canon anymore?

just don't bother. even if you love the dinosaur special effects of previous films, there's really not much here that you didn't see before, and some of it is actually pretty bad and unbelievable for a film from 2018. just don't bother.",low
5849,"i spent half the time scoffing at the plot jurassic world 2 was throwing at me, which diluted the fun i was having by looking at the superb cgi, moderate man-dinosaur action, and an overall fine cast performance. it still is a lot worse than jurassic world (2015), which had a story almost as good as the original, the legendary jurassic park (1993) which almost seems impossible to mimic or better today. tn.",low

5853,"some things age like fine wine and in the cinematic world the ‘mission: impossible’ franchise is a great example of the adage. perhaps it has to do with the 56-year-old tom cruise who defies age and pushes his physical boundaries for our viewing pleasure? the answer is quite evident in ‘fallout’ as his ethan hunt is as good as a caped superhero in the sixth film of the series. the story isn't all that new with its twists and turns. but ‘fallout’ manages to build on the previous films in the series by bringing back old friends and foes, besides adding some new ones. henry cavill as august walker fits right into this universe as the hammer to the scalpel that is ethan hunt. his presence is looming enough to fill the entire screen whenever he appears. simon pegg takes on the status of a series regular alongside ving rhames, whose benji and luther respectively play more than just mere sidekicks as they add comic levity and heart. alec baldwin and angela bassett also make a mark in their brief appearances but watch out for impactful turns by rebecca ferguson and michelle monaghan along the way.

writer & director christopher mcquarrie allows each character to shine while building on their history with each other, thus making them endearing to the audience. this only serves to up the ante when they’re in danger. mcquarrie also lets the story breathe by bringing some calm before the storm hits. which leads to the most crucial aspect of the series, and one that mcquarrie clearly excels at in this film – the action sequences. not only are they meticulously planned; they are executed with precision, even when the fist fights are gritty and gruesome. rob hardy beautifully choreographs the camerawork following these intricate set-pieces, either allowing you to take in the expanse or bringing you up close and personal when required. this is paired with a soundtrack by lorne balfe that lends to the tension by giving the iconic ‘mission impossible’ theme a sinister sense of urgency.

mcquarrie has now directed two ‘mission: impossible’ films; his understanding of the franchise and its characters proves to be the secret weapon of the series. the fact that the stunts are largely done with practical effects featuring the cast, and most prominently cruise himself, sets a whole new standard for action films. ‘mission: impossible – fallout’ is a great mix of plot, pacing and performances that is undeniably the best entry in the franchise, while it re-establishes cruise’s status as an action superstar.

5863,"i was looking forward to this. it has two of my favorite actors in it. unfortunately, i had to give up on watching it. it's impossible to see what's going on. there are some shadows moving about, sometimes covering each other. a dot lights up occasionally on my 55-inch oled. i can see subtitles, hear the sound. this is apparently one of those ""someone invented hdr, that means we should put a cloth over the lens"" kind of movies. such a shame.",low
5873,"hugely entertaining film from start to finish, with amazing performances from the three lead women. emma stone proves that once again she's not just a pretty face as the conniving and troubled abigail, rachel weisz is always on form as the controlling and vindictive sarah and olivia coleman deserved the oscar as the childish and sickly queen anne. nicholas hoult's foppish rogue harley steals every scene he is in.

yorgos lanthimos once again has made a beautifully shot film using  mostly natural light. i can't overstate that this film looks gorgeous. many times over i thought of barry lyndon, but with tonnes of humour, foul language, and no ryan o'neal to destroy the soul of the film.

i originally gave this 9/10 because i didn't like the use of fish-eye lens, but i couldn't stop thinking of how much i enjoyed it so i bumped it up to 10.

5881,"i have the impression that this movie is not a favorite of the hardcore marvel community, which makes sense, as i am not part of that community and this is flat out my favorite entry into the marvel line. in fact, it is the only marvel film i have recommended my wife watch with me. (she hasn’t taken me up on it yet.)

i like the humor from the scott lang character and its self-deprecating tendency. perhaps it would be over the top in a more serious entry like the infinity movies, but it works here. i really enjoy the chemistry between him and his daughter and i even appreciate the luis character, which apparently separates me from the serious marvel viewers. it is a fun ride and is not so much fueled by the violence of the other entries in the genre. 

in fact, the only thing i didn’t like is the bittersweet way this movie is tied into the infinity universe, regarding scott (ant-man) and his daughter. and since that happens off in a different film altogether, it allows the story within this movie to stand on its own. if the reason you haven’t watched this is because you aren’t into the rest of the marvel series or are worried about not getting it out of sequence, don’t worry. it stands on its own.",high
5884,"as with the last one...michael peña is still the best part of the movie. he's the heart and soul of the ant-man movies. unfortunately this time his stories aren't made with the same hysterical blunt finesse they were in the past. but that doesn't take away from his delivery.

and unfortunately that goes with the rest of the movie.

it's fun to watch and entertaining, and that is what matters, but the wind was sort of out of the sails here. blame it on the script, the acting and direction were fine, they just didn't have a lot to work with.",high
5890,"ocean's eight has been my comfort movie for the longest time. i adore the strength of the cast, and the dynamics they possess as a whole, not to mention the brilliant cinematography. the humour and the relationships of the characters brings a sense of lightheartedness to the movie, which i personally adore. overall, it's a very underappreciated movie in terms of the writing, casting and cinematography, as well as the costume and makeup departments.",high
5892,"they tried to do the ghostbusters thing with this one didn't they? no, not the all female cast thing, which i guess they did try and do, but really i mean the ""if you don't like this movie, we're going to threaten you with horrible labels"" thing.

and the result are cautionary reviews that all kind of sound as if the people are too afraid to call it boring...so they are going to point out the one decent performance in the film.

but even then, you got the feeling that some of the cast wasn't really into threatening the audience to like the movie. watching the interviews, you got the feeling that, yeah, they knew it was boring. only one or two of them looked really prepared to be combative about forcing the public to love it.

meanwhile, this is a heist film, you are supposed to have comedy or action and in many cases both...and at least they tried for comedy in jokes that didn't entirely land. in fact, for the most part, the attempts at humor left you with a ""meh"" feeling at best. you can see where its supposed to be a laugh but it doesn't even really turn a cheek in the right direction.

and then the action was all under cooked.

so you're left with a story about a woman that is going to double cross the oceans team, has the opportunity to do it, but then doesn't at the last minute for...reasons that are never really explained.",low

despite the fairly juvenile jokes, the sometime illogical script and the way over the top chop-chop-and-chop-some-more violence i had great fun watching this movie. i really enjoyed the action sequences a’la kill bill, the special effects and yes, the jokes. most of the time at least)

everything was so silly and over the top that it actually became funny. each scene, taken by itself, would probably have been considered silly, or even bad, by me but stringed together in the context of the movie as a whole it just worked. for me at least.

the action sequences, cgi and everything that should be in a superhero movie was, in my mind, quite good. also, despite not really being anything to write home about the story was quite adequate. simple, straightforward and a lot better than the crap that a lot of the stuff that social and political correctness preaching writers at marvel are spewing out these days.

i definitely liked cable as the hard hitting ass-kicking cyborg. when domino was first introduced i was not impressed, even though she’s hot. i mean, luck as a superpower? however, when she started to pull all these hilarious stunts with these incredibly unbelievable chains of events i quickly changed my mind. oh, and i did like deadpool of course. that goes without saying. if you do not like the main protagonist it is difficult to like the movie itself is it not?

most of the other characters were between okay and so so. the one character i never really liked was firefist. he was never funny, just incredibly stupid and childish.

the team of fellow mutant “warriors” that deadpool pulled together? well let’s say that i am not that disappointed that they were somewhat “expendable” but it looks like that was the whole point of it. when the first of them whammed into that bus i thought “what the f…?” and then it just continued with one gory event following another. nice touch with the blue blood by the way. i guess the guy was an alien after all.

to sum it up, a lot of the movie was pretty much what i expected but altogether i think i was positively surprised. two hours of great fun actually.",high
5911,"really i felt the jokes landed a heck of a lot more in this one than they did in deadpool, and for a movie like this it counts for a lot.

it seemed to hit all ends of the political spectrum in the humor, and that too worked, especially as the character is satirical and prone to break the 4th wall...which also applies to our society as a whole. and it worked very well for this film.

the blood, the sex, the vulgarity all actually added to the plot as a whole, it fit like a glove and accented the humor as a whole to make the film darkly funny, especially with a plot that at times was intentionally inane and pointless and, at times, deeper than you'd expect for a self-deprecating super hero film.

it's worth watching twice at least, even if, the second time around, you see all the best laughs coming.",high

- andrew garfield; ""andrew garfield interview: _under the silver lake_, pop culture obsessions, and spider-verse"" (ben travis); _empire_ (march 19, 2019)

in 2001, an unknown 26-year-old filmmaker named richard kelly released a film called _donnie darko_. filmed on a tight budget over a few weeks, it made little impact at the box-office, but was critically championed as heralding a genuinely unique and exciting voice in genre filmmaking. the following year, the film was released on vhs and dvd, earning twice as much as it did at the cinema, and giving kelly virtual _carte blanche_ for his next project. in 2006, that hotly-anticipated project was premièred in a rough-cut form at cannes. the 160-minute _southland tales_ was savaged by critics, and went through multiple re-edits before a 144-minute version was released theatrically in north america in 2007. grossing less than $1 million against a $7 million budget, the film was released straight-to-dvd in most international territories. kelly's career has yet to recover, and he has made only one film since. in 2014, david robert mitchell released his second feature, _it follows_, which he shot on a tight budget over a few weeks. a box office and critical success, the film was championed as heralding a genuinely unique and exciting voice in genre filmmaking, giving mitchell virtual _carte blanche_ for his next project. in 2018, that hotly-anticipated project was premièred at cannes, where it was savaged by critics.

okay, the analogy isn't perfect – _southland tales_ was kelly's second film, whereas _under the silver lake_ is mitchell's third; _it follows_ was nowhere near as good or as celebrated as _donnie darko_; and _under the silver lake_ isn't quite as bad as _southland tales_, nor have the negative reviews from cannes been quite as damning or universal. however, the sequence of events is undeniably similar - a young filmmaker riding high on an unexpected success dusts off an ambitious older project he had been unable to make at the time, and is given far too much autonomy and leeway, resulting in a pretentious, self-indulgent, convoluted, overlong mess. it's like no one has learnt from the hubris of michael cimino!

positioning itself as equal parts neo-noir and genre subversion, _under the silver lake_ is essentially a cross between david lynch's _mulholland drive_ (2001) and thomas pynchon's _inherent vice_ (2009). with the major difference being that it's absolutely, unrelentingly terrible. as with mitchell's previous films, _silver lake_ works as both an example and a subversion of genre - _the myth of the american sleepover_ (2010) was a homage to films such as peter bogdanovich's _the last picture show_ (1971), george lucas's _american graffiti_ (1973) and the work of john hughes, whilst also deconstructing the coming-of-age subgenre; and _it follows_ recalls films such as william friedkin's _the exorcist_ (1973), wes craven's _a nightmare on elm street_ (1984) and the work of john carpenter, whilst also satirising the tropes of such films. _silver lake_ is no different - a mystery noir à la robert aldrich's _kiss me deadly_ (1955), robert altman's _the long goodbye_ (1973), and roman polański's _chinatown_ (1974), the film is also at pains to undermine and critique many of the generic markers found in such films. a 140-minute labyrinthine, paranoia-laden shaggy-dog story full of macguffins, false leads, narrative dead ends, and unexplained details, the film relocates the detective stories of raymond chandler and dashiell hammett to the chaotic postmodern era of cognitive semiotics where the relationship between signifier and signified is now so arbitrary that meaning-making itself has become a protean commodity. however, it is easily the most self-important piece of garbage i've seen in a long time; a philosophically juvenile rumination thoroughly convinced of its own portentousness. fundamentally misogynistic (it's not misogyny, apparently, because mitchell is being super-ironic when he presents no less than six female characters as literal sex toys for the protagonist), it's at least 45 minutes too long, with an unfocused narrative, poorly thought-out metaphors, an insipid protagonist, about 377 themes, and a laughable screenplay. the cinematography is pretty though.

set in contemporary la, _under the silver lake_ follows sam (andrew garfield), a 33-year-old man-child with no job, no ambition, and no direction, whose day consists of sitting on his balcony watching his neighbour (wendy vanden heuvel) parade around topless, having unfulfilling nsa sex with a friend-with-benefits (riki lindhome), and visiting his drinking buddy (topher grace) to use a drone to spy on women (it should tell you a bunch about the film that none of these three characters are even assigned a name). out of the blue, he meets and instantly falls in love with sarah (an admittedly radiant riley keough), but when he visits her apartment the day after meeting her, he finds her gone and the apartment empty, apart from a shoebox with a photograph and a few trinkets, and a strange symbol painted on the wall. although he later identifies sarah as one of three women killed in a car crash alongside billionaire media mogul (and professional stuntman) jefferson sevence (chris gann), having recognised a hat found at the scene to be hers, he refuses to believe she's dead. and so begins an odyssey to track her down that ultimately involves, amongst other things, a parrot who keeps repeating the same meaningless phrase, a hipster pirate, secret codes hidden in everyday objects such as statues, song lyrics, _nintendo power_ magazines, and cereal boxes, a glam rock band named jesus and the brides of dracula, the july 1970 issue of _playboy_, a dog murderer, a conspiracy theorist comic book writer (patrick fischler), the hobo code, a vast network of underground tunnels, an actual literal homeless king (david yow), a helpful coyote, an unhelpful skunk, an escort agency staffed by former child-stars, a balloon dancer (grace van patten), a walled-off xanadu-like mansion, a mysterious songwriter (jeremy bobb) with a strange claim, a female serial killer who enters men's apartments wearing nothing but an owl mask, and a new age cult lead by super-wealthy men.

and if this makes it sound convoluted, unwieldly, and overly plotted, believe me, you don't know the half of it.

perhaps the most immediately obvious aspects of _silver lake_ is the sheer range of homages that mitchell includes at both plot and formal levels. some of these homages are impressively handled, some not so much. the music by rich vreeland, for example, and the cinematography by mike gioulakis are both extremely retro, serving to situate the film firmly in the formal styles of yesterday. vreeland's score (although i didn't like it in and of itself) is a solid imitation of the work of composers such as franz waxman (_sunset boulevard_; _a place in the sun_; _rear window_) and bernard herrmann (_citizen kane_; _vertigo_; _psycho_), whilst gioulakis's photography, with its overly dramatic camera movements and crash zooms that seem to come out of nowhere, recalls the work of robert burks (_rear window_; _to catch a thief_; _vertigo_) and sam leavitt (_the defiant ones_; _anatomy of a murder_; _cape fear_).

most of the other homages come at plot level, and although some are well integrated into the narrative, many feel shoehorned in, as if mitchell is showing off his range of reference, so much so that the film essentially becomes pastiche. examples include sam's mother's obsession with janet gaynor, particularly frank borzage's _7th heaven_ (1927); sam sitting on his balcony using binoculars to spy on people, á la l.b. jefferies (james stewart) in alfred hitchcock's _rear window_ (1954); sam's fascination with don ornitz's picture of janet wolf from the cover of the july 1970 issue of _playboy_; a nirvana poster above sam's bed; sam and sarah watching jean negulesco's _how to marry a millionaire_ (1953); a brief glimpse of an _amazing spider-man_ comic (intertextual and self-reflexive, given garfield's appearance as the titular character in two films); a visual quotation of marilyn monroe in a swimming pool from george cukor's unfinished _something's got to give_ (1962); the brides of dracula doing a cover of lulu's ""to sir with love"" (1967) from james clavell's film of the same name; r.e.m.'s ""strange currencies"" (1994) playing at a party; a visit to griffith observatory from nicholas ray's _rebel without a cause_ (1955); references to the original _legend of zelda_ (1986); a very on-the-nose shot of a gravestone with the word ""hitchcock"" on it; and a scene that references songs as varied as the arrows' ""i love rock 'n' roll"" (1975), gary portnoy's ""where everybody knows your name"" (1982) from the tv show _cheers_, foreigner's ""i want to know what love is"" (1984), harold faltermeyer's ""axel f"" (1985) from the film _beverly hills cop_, pixies' ""where is my mind?"" (1988), nirvana's ""smells like teen spirit"" (1991), and backstreet boys' ""i want it that way"" (1999). the most consistent referential touchstone, however, is david lynch, particularly _mulholland drive_, an infinitely superior mystery thriller also set in the darker environs of la involving a sprawling cast of strange characters.

thematically, the film is all over the place, never settling on any one issue (or even a few issues), instead jumping around like a hyperactive puppy trying to be in eight different places at once. characters say things such as ""_who isn't being followed these days?_"" and ""_the ideology you thought you adopted through free will was actually subliminal messaging_"", but it's all meaningless in a narrative chaos where nothing is ever examined for more than a couple of minutes before the film leaps onto something new. positing that pop culture has profound hidden meaning (in direct contrast to most cultural-anthropological thinking), the film is so imprecise and scattered that it's impossible to tell if mitchell actually buys into the notion that schizophrenic conspiracies are all around us or if he's being facetious.

and yes, i understand what he's doing here - presenting the film from the point of view of a pop culture-saturated millennial who's easily distracted and hence keeps losing the run of his own story. however, just because it's apparent what the director is trying to do doesn't mean he has succeeded. oliver stone did a far better job of depicting a similarly media-soaked shortened-attention span over 20 years ago with _natural born killers_ (1994). easily the most interesting issue touched on is the concept that much of what has defined generations and been the artistic impetus behind and symbol of cultural revolutions throughout the 20th century all comes from the same corrupted and cynical place; the music that has most embodied rebellion and freedom is actually even more manufactured than the worst boy band could ever be. this is a fascinating and fundamentally postmodernist way of thinking, but mere moments after introducing it, mitchell abandons the theme entirely in favour of a piece of absolutely gratuitous violence which says nothing of interest about anything.

the most troubling thing about the film from a thematic point of view, however, is how it depicts women. yes, it's partly about the male gaze and how hollywood has a track record of objectifying women, especially in films of this nature, so a degree of objectification is necessary. but mitchell does it to the point where critique simply becomes content - he doesn't need six women (only two of whom are even given names, and none of whom receive much in the way of characterisation) to throw themselves at sam to adequately deconstruct the trope. granted, his intentions may be noble; he is obviously side-lining the female characters with the goal of satirising male entitlement, but he is unable to distinguish between replication and repudiation. all the best intentions in the world don't alter the fact that the women in the film are wallpaper, and his attempt to critique hollywood's tendency to depict women as such ends up as simply another example of the very trope he is setting out to critique. so all the unnecessarily topless shots aren't exploitative you see, because irony!! additionally, it's worth mentioning that sam doesn't initiate a single sexual encounter; every one of them is initiated by the woman. how does that fit into mitchell's deconstruction of hollywood's depiction of men using women, if the women are essentially allowing themselves to be used? if his critique was in any way consistent, sam would be seducing them, not the other way around, thus allowing mitchell to directly engage with the notion that men look at women as playthings. it's a facile attempt to critique a theme that cries out this is a filmmaker attempting something that he simply doesn't have the requisite ability to pull off.

and if only these thematic issues were the film's only problems, it mightn't be so bad. unfortunately, there is so, so much else wrong here. this is a (supposed) satire, yet there is practically no humour. there are a couple of funny scenes (such as when sam beats up two children for egging his car), but they are few and far between. additionally, mitchell completely fails to make us care about sam or his quest to find sarah; there is no emotional connection whatsoever. as for the quest itself, it soon becomes obvious that we're following sam down a rabbit-hole which mitchell has filled to the brim with pointless digressions, meaningless distractions, and derivative clichés. whereas in _mulholland drive_, lynch creates a beautiful and complex tapestry where everything has precise meaning, with no wasted motion, no weirdness simply for weirdness sake, in _silver lake_, mitchell just lobs anything and everything at the viewer whether it's ultimately significant or not. a pirate? sure. a female serial killer? why not. a dog murderer? of course. a story that makes sense and deals with its themes coherently? don't be ridiculous. it's like the worst type of student film where the filmmaker has been allowed to shoot whatever he wants, and ends up making something so convoluted that any meaning it may have becomes subsumed amongst self-important pretension. and the more needlessly complex and bloated the plot becomes, the less interesting it is. the whole thing smacks of mitchell shouting ""_look at me. look how wacky i am._""

_under the silver lake_ is a tiresome, self-important, overlong, intellectually juvenile mess. if mitchell actually has anything to say about subliminal messaging, the commodification of women, wealth buying privileges even in the afterlife, the pervasiveness of pop culture, or conspiracy theories, it's lost within a painfully dull and self-indulgent plot. with _it follows_, mitchell was constricted by a tight budget. with _silver lake_, he has been allowed to play relatively unsupervised in the sandbox, and the results are disastrous; a swollen, self-admiring film that can't follow through on anything, thematically or narratively, a film that is totally and completely in love with itself.",low
5933,"i think that _insidious_ might genuinely be a franchise best watched in the story's chronological order, rather than the movies' release dates. i can't be certain though, because i'd have to re-watch them all to make sure i'm not making a bad recommendation, and i'm not super keen on doing that seeing as this one and the one preceding it were both kinda... bad.

the mythology of _insidious_ is something i am very interested in, and _the last key_ added it to it **somewhat**. but if this is the sort of quality we can expect from future instalments, then maybe we should never see the resolution of the same cliffhanger ending that they've given us for **the last three movies in a row**.

5934,"with so many movies today about exorcisms, i was expecting just another copy of those movies, but on my surprise, this movie was different and well shot, quite scary. atmosphere was good, makeup was done brilliant and almost everything in short was great, but there were few mistakes in some scenes that were too unrealistic and basically mistakes. for example: when megan shows lisa the footage of camera where corpse is clearly visible in the corridor, lisa says that it's just a shadow? seriously? shadow of what? how in the center of something there can be shadow of nothing? and then lisa notices the medicine xanax and starts giving megan a hard time and lectures about using xanax completely ignoring the footage and fact that something unusual, some figure is spotted in the camera. this scene was very unrealistic and in real scenario any sane person would pay attention to that footage instead of stupid xanax.

second mistake was when megan tells randy about wound of corpse and randy also recalls that corpse had a huge wound and now it's gone and instead of being shocked and curious how it happened guy starts talking about his past life that he had problems with drinking... i understand that horror genre is unrealistic itself, but those scenes were too much and lacked the common sense.

5960,"it’s always a bad sign when the first thing we see in a movie is the dictionary definition of the title. it’s bad because it assumes that we’re too ignorant to know what the word means — in this case, ‘acrimony,’ which i would say ranks lowish in the hemingway-faulkner scale —, and why would we want to watch a film that underestimates, sight unseen, our intelligence? 

moreover, if writer/director tyler perry deems his chosen title to be so obscure that he had best not even risk giving us the benefit of the doubt, why didn’t he pick another, more accesible word — one that he feels is common enough to be part of our obviously limited vocabularies? 

anyway, acrimony is the strange tale of crazy-ass melinda (taraji p. henson), who puts up with deadbeat husband robert gayle (lyriq bent) for 18 years; when she finally divorces him, his cockamamie invention — a self-charging battery that he calls “gayle force wind” — becomes an overnight sensation (well, not so much 'overnight,’ but you get the idea), turning robert into a wealthy man, and melinda into a major cunt who feels he owes her everything he’d promised her way back when — including a yacht that he was going to call the “mrs. gayle.” why the “mrs. gayle”? i mean, what’s wrong with the 'melinda’? but more on that later.

melinda and robert met in college. he helps her study for a history test, which she fails nonetheless; no wonder, considering robert is actually a mechanical engineering student. clearly, he’s full of crap, and she should know better — nay, she does know better; not with the benefit of hindsight (the movie is told in flashback, complete with a voice-over narration; another very bad sign), but right then and there, or at least she makes it sound that way: “you ever get that feeling when a man is telling you something, and you know it’s [expletive deleted], but you just go with it? … well, i knew this was [expletive deleted], and i tried to go with it.” 

the question is, why does she keep going with it? to quote stephen king, “fool me once, shame on you. fool me twice, shame on me. fool me three times, shame on both of us.” having said that, is robert even fooling her, really?

melinda’s mother passes away (we hear about her mother exactly two times; the second time, which follows 20 seconds after the first, is the announcement of her death). robert comes to the wake, briefly pays his respects, and then leaves. 

melinda catches up to him, offers him a ride to his house — actually an rv —, and once there, invites herself in. but when they end up having sex, this is what she has to say about it: “my mother wasn’t even cold in the ground yet, and there i was. what kind of man takes advantage of a girl’s grief, huh? i’ll tell you. a low-life maggot of a mother[expletive deleted], that’s who. he had to know that grief can leave you open to not knowing yourself at all.” “he had to know that grief can leave you open to not knowing yourself at all.” but did he really have to know that, though? does anyone, for that matter? is that even a knowable thing? 

later on, robert is cheating on melinda in his rv; melinda drives over there and t-bones the rv, flipping it over. she bears the brunt of the impact, though: “i slammed my body against the steering wheel so hard. internal bleeding. and worse, ruptured ovaries. a full hysterectomy, and i wasn’t even 21 years old. children, never.”

even if this were possible — and given the location of the ovaries in the female body, i doubt it very much —, how exactly would it be his fault? also, ever heard of adoption, surrogacy, etc.? there are several other ways that robert and melinda could have raised a family after she forgives him and marries him (which she of course does).

leaving out the impossible ovary-busting incident, this could be good material for a farce; for some reason i keep picturing something like carl reiner’s the jerk. the only comedy here, however, is unintentional; for example, when robert remarries and at last buys the yacht of his dreams, he stills names it the “mrs. gayle” like he promised melinda — she’s no longer mrs. gayle, but the name is nevertheless technically correct. now, if perry had any sense of humor to speak of, robert would have christened the boat the “mrs. gayle 2.”",low
5962,"one of the best movies i've watched in years. a masterpiece in every sense from the storytelling going through the production and ending with the masterful photography. it remainded me other such ""childhood memories"" masterpieces like amarcord or even bergman's fanny and alexander. the movie shows a year (circa 1970) in the life of a middle class, intellectual family through the eyes of their domestic helper, cleo. she comes from a small town, has an indigenous background and works for the family within one of these arrangements (common in underdeveloped parts of the world) where the worker is treated somewhere between older sister and slave. she is emotionally involved with the children in a reciprocal relationship but she still has to work with very few (if any) worker's rights. the relationship is indeed complex and its treatment is the main strenght of the movie in my view.

instead what you get is a film that, well, that feels like a hit piece from start to finish and it comes as a shock when the film ends and the director didn't take the opportunity to blame him for the reichstag fire.

5976,"i finally got around to this, and i think my issue with it is adonis creed.

i kind of passed it over in the first one, because, honestly, it was just nice to see another rocky movie, and you did see creed train and fight and struggle a bit.

what we have is a kid that grew up an orphan, but at a young age got adopted into a life of privilege, had a good job, and didn't have to struggle financially, until he kind of did when he wanted to become a full time boxer... and then the story takes off.

and that was all passable, because he didn't exactly win did he? it was a hard fought first movie and he still had to go through a pretty tough arch to get to where he was that was both interesting and compelling... so despite the relative flaws in creed, it was an enjoyable enough film to watch and far better than most of the movies we've been getting lately.

by the time creed ii rolls around, however, adonis creed is just whiny. and that's really it, his character isn't really allowed to progress any further, he's not allowed to grow in any way.

the poster suggests that there was a hard fought and emotional battle that adonis had to over come and made it through a better man that when he started. the raw emotion of the poster makes us believe that he faced something insurmountable and came out victorious through sheer will alone.

and, honestly, that is how the fight itself played out and i loved every minute of it. both michael b. jordan and florian munteanu sold each and every blow and you could almost feel it as you sat back shoving your face with popcorn.

but in the end, adonis was still the same whiny little brat he was at the start of the first creed installment and we are two films in. he hasn't grown in any way, no personal faults were over come. he's not at all a changed person, so you're left with the feeling that you haven't grown with him, you haven't progressed any, and by the end of the film you are left wondering what the point of it all was.",low
5977,"creed ii takes pieces of the previous rocky stories and is able to completely transform them into a better, more emotional story that can easily resonate with audiences.

if i have one big complaint about this installment, it would be that the script steals almost every single story beat from rocky iv. but, at the same time, that is one of the most interesting aspects. rocky iv had so much potential to be an emotionally impactful movie but failed to capture that tone due to the 80s camp that was heavily featured. in creed ii, we get to see the fallout of the fight between rocky and drago. where rocky went on to be a national treasure in retirement, drago met a worse fate in russia. his wife left him, his country turned its back on him, and he and his son were completely alone. this isolation drives the two in order to regain the respect of their countrymen and is a very compelling motive. on the other hand, adonis is attempting to gain redemption for the creeds by beating the fighters that single handedly killed his father all those years ago. this story is able to evolve all of our main characters, with donnie being able to accept his father's absence and become a father figure for his newly born daughter. rocky learns to care for and communicate with others, resulting in him gaining a relationship with his son. and with the drago’s realizing that they don’t need the acceptance of russia to become successful in their own right. this story really worked for me and was exactly the type of film i wished rocky iv would have been.

our cast is once again superb; michael b. jordan’s chemistry with stallone and tessa thompson is fantastic, and he is so great in this role. there is a scene with rocky giving adonis a very emotional speech about why he wants to fight, and it honestly rivals his speech in rocky balboa; it sent shivers down my spine. our villains are spectacular. dolph lundgren is incredible and actually has a substantial role, with him being the hard-nosed jackass of a father to viktor. his journey towards the end of the movie is very fulfilling. florian munteanu was a surprise and was really able to portray the complex emotions of his character. his subtle facial expressions during the final fight really showed that his heart was not fully in it, unlike his father.

the fight scenes are fantastic. there is a sudden brutality to them that really emphasizes the sheer size and power of viktor drago, creating a very intimidating feel to the matches. even though the choreography and cinematography might not be as great as the original, it is still able to do an incredible job of staging and filming the fights.

overall, this movie is genuinely excellent, and while it might not fully live up to the original, it is a worthy successor in almost every way.

lovely movie. 😊

i honestly wasn't expecting much, but i wanted to support mercyme, and i always like to throw my support whenever a movie theater plays a good, clean movie like this one.

i was actually quite amazed by the production. it had the look of a big budget film (i have no idea how much the budget was), and was lacking the cheese element prevalent in so many christian movies. it was remarkably well cast, and i was particularly impressed by both guys who played bart - the 11 year old bart (brody rose), and the teenage/20something bart (j michael finley). i also loved trace adkins as brickell.

i took my non-believer friend to it, because he likes mercyme, and has enjoyed bart's testimonies whenever i've taken him to a concert, and he liked the movie as well. he even teared up, and he is not an emotional guy! i cried too, but i'm an emotional girl! 😉

i definitely recommend it. i'm not a person who enjoys going to the movie theater, and usually will only go in special circumstances. i think mainstream america playing a christian movie in the theater is a special circumstance, and if you want to see more of this happening, i hope you'll go support it.",high

6033,"samson is a biblical drama that ironically appears to have been made by philistines. the movie treats samson as if he was an israelite version of hercules (which he may have very well been); sadly, the only hercules director bruce macdonald seems to knows of is kevin sorbo's in the legendary journeys — to the point of giving him his own iolaus (though iolaus at least had an equivalent in greek mythology).

the year is ""1170 bc"" in ""ancient israel"". i think the date alone would be enough to clue us in that we’re not in 'modern' israel; on the other hand, considering that the establishing shot of “israel” is a computer-generated image, perhaps the clarification is not as useless as it seems.

we meet samson (taylor james) and his heretofore unheard of younger brother caleb (greg kriek) stealing corn; caught in the act, they both flee from philistine soldiers who, for some reason, stop chasing them once samson and caleb pass through the city gates — unfortunately, the film fails to have a philistine soldier tell another: “forget it, jacob. it's chinatown"" (not as far-fetched as you may think; later there will be a direct reference to the avengers’ hulk).

“whispers of a hebrew with great strength” reach the ears of the philistine prince rallah (jackson rathbone); he doesn't take them too seriously, but his father, king balek (billy zane), orders him to investigate further, something rallah does with no little reluctance (to paraphrase iznogoud, rallah wants to be king in place of the king). rallah, listen to your friend billy zane, he’s a cool dude.

rallah recruits a philistine giant (who calls the god of the hebrews a “puny god”) to defeat samson; samson gets his ass handed to him at first, but when the lord fills him with his spirit, samson hulks up (that’s a reference to the other hulk, mind you) and soon has the giant saying 'no más, no más'. 

from here on out the plot sticks more or less faithfully to the biblical account, with a small but peculiar departure wherein samson has to be tricked into visiting a brothel; the book of judges says begs to differ, though: ""then went samson to gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her.""

anyway, samson is anointed judge and travels to the philistine capital to negotiate peace with balek; his conditions are “reduce the tribute, return the harvest that is rightfully ours [or else] you will face the wrath of god.” 

in the film’s best line, zane replies, with all the considerable sarcasm he can muster, ""so you threaten me with natural phenomena, freakish acts, and the weather."" ha! in your face samson! it almost makes me forget that balek and rallah are just as imaginary as caleb-iolaus — not that samson or delilah are historical figures, but almost; their story is so well known that you don't have to know your bible to realize that this samson is as much a caricature as the simpsons' version of david and goliath.",low
6035,"if you enjoy reading my spoiler-free reviews, please follow my blog :)

living in portugal has a ton of pros, but regarding movies, it lacks serious advantages. the price of admission is expensive, there is only one film theater in my city (every time i want to watch a movie on imax or dolby atmos, it's a financial effort and time-consuming) and the worst of all, a whole bunch of films aren't released in their original date, especially november/december oscar-bait movies. only now i had the opportunity to see green book, and i am so mad i wasn't able to write its review in 2018 because this is undoubtedly the best comedy-drama of last year and one of the best overall!

with the help of a terrific cast, peter farrelly and his writing crew (which counts with vallelonga's son, nick) deliver what i think is the best screenplay of 2018. i can't remember the last time i cried of so much laughter in a film. i can't remember the last time i did the latter and still got emotional with the dramatic arc. this comedy-drama sent me through a roller coaster of emotions i wasn't expecting, at all. i went in anticipating outstanding performances (check) and solely that. since 2019 has already begun, i'm watching the oscar-bait movies with no real hopes of being utterly amazed.

however, green book completely took me by surprise. i genuinely don't know why everyone was so shocked when it won best screenplay at the golden globe awards. it possesses such a well-written story, filled with brilliant narratives about the most sensitive subjects. it takes the two main characters and elevates their individual arcs into subplots where you begin and end with two completely different personas. it's an extremely relevant film that shows how our world evolved and fought back racism and discrimination, without ever becoming too dark or even dull. it's not more of the same, it's not another movie produced exclusively to send a social message and catch some oscar nominations. it's a truly captivating story of how two men can change their perspective of another race or even the entire world, by actually spending time with another culture and ignoring preconceived notions.

nevertheless, this well-structured, beautifully-directed and cleverly-written film would be just ""good"" if not for the two incredible actors, who take this movie to a whole other level. viggo mortensen and mahershala ali have such compelling chemistry that i wouldn't mind watching them interact for two hours on a car trip. every single car sequence either produces hilarious moments, filled with tearful laughter, or it drastically changes into a more dramatic and emotional tone, subtly touching delicate topics. i knew mortensen had a humorous side to him, but i never saw this coming! his timing, his expressions, his italian accent, his body movements, everything about his performance is perfect. he absolutely nailed his part, by giving me the best time i had at a film theater in a long time, and his oscar nomination is more than fair. he made a 130-min feature movie feel like a short flick.

ali doesn't come far behind. obviously, since viggo has a funnier role to portray, the audience members might feel that he's just there to help his co-star shine, but he does much more than that. since he brings the drama element to the story, he has a more restrained performance during the first half of the film. however, once shirley starts getting along with tony lip, ali gradually offers more and more splendid acting moments. he's definitely a supporting actor, but god is he a phenomenal one! linda cardellini (dolores vallelonga), even though she's only on-screen for a few minutes spread throughout the runtime, also delivers a great performance.

tony lip and dr. don shirley have quite distinct personalities, besides being from different races. each character's arc is brilliantly illustrated by peter farrelly, who gradually shows how tony and don are changing their view of the world and of each other's culture. either through the witty car sequences or through unfortunate and horrible experiences, these two characters carry the audience on a journey of growth. change in behavior, mindset and preconceived ideas, by sharing their own culture with another. even though they were born in different countries and lived through distinguished lifestyles, with contrasting quality of life, they eventually start realizing that what they think of the world and everything else might not be entirely right.

technically, farrelly controls the movie's pacing exceptionally well, by making a two-hour-ish film feel like half of it. remarkably-balanced tone and some great cinematography is showed in a couple of scenes. consistently-filmed and well-edited, even though the latter has small hiccups here and there. nevertheless, this isn't a film with extraordinary technical attributes, nor it needs them. farrelly only needed to do ""ok"" with the producing and filming of a standout screenplay to achieve a fantastic result, and that's exactly what he did.

finally, regarding the controversy surrounding this movie ... see how easy it is to watch a film without being affected by outside matters which don't have a single thing to do with the movie itself? i don't care if someone who worked in the film tweeted something wrong today, let alone years ago. i don't care if someone misinterprets viggo mortensen's speech about racism. i don't care if the family of don shirley doesn't like how the movie approaches his way of being or his way of life. i don't care if the story isn't 100% true, as long as it succeeds in transmitting the vital message it wants to deliver, while actually being a good film. so, please, stop trying to listen to everything everyone says about a movie or the people working on it, especially nowadays, where chaos is easy to create.

green book surprised the hell out of me and left me speechless in the end. one of the best comedy-dramas i've seen in a long time, one of the best films of 2017 and, by far, the best original screenplay of the last year. peter farrelly and his fellow co-writers delivered a seamlessly-written story, filled with wonderful character arcs and with a quite important message to the audiences around the world. viggo mortensen and mahershala ali deliver award-worthy performances, especially the former who shows his incredible comedic timing and dramatic range. still, the most compelling and emotional scenes come from ali, and he does not deserve to be forgotten. i thought 2018 was going to be the first year without me giving an a+, but guess what ...

rating: a+",high
6036,"""frequently, when someone tries to portray the overwhelming decade of the 1960s, they usually misuse the concept of discrimination towards african americans, which is accurate to describe this social issue. nevertheless, the way peter farrelly and staff go into detail about this social wretchedness embodying the psychological impact it has in the main character makes the film an outstanding one"".

the year is 1962, and the film begins inside copacabana restaurant where we get introduced the imposing personality of tony lip, an italian descendant whose family came from a lower middle class coping with some financial difficulties. the way viggo mortensen performs the character is a proper model of then american racism; therefore he attempted to keep them out until the occasion arrived and don shirley appeared in his path, offering him a two-month lifetime opportunity. we all need to bear in mind the precise dates because, in real life, it was nearly a year they spent together. despite his gifted pianist skills and his upper-class status, he was still a victim of the convulsed cultural impact. both of them, during the film, learn from each other and fight against the unsettling behaviour of determined people. 

although it may seem simple, their interaction is one of the primary reasons why it succeeds. believe it or not, it arouses curiosity, reaches the climax when they finally let them know as they are, and sometimes it results as a plot twister due to the radical temperament change of each actor. it has been ages since i watched such a pleasant film; afterwards, i felt refreshed as though it renewed me.

the contextualisation was imperative to build up each one's personality; moreover, it was visually dazzling owing to the costumes, the space and the background advertisement of the decade. comedy is present as well so that you won't be missing from genuine laughs. everything appears to be perfectly balanced, even the role of secondary personages such as tony's wife and the cheeky cards experience. i'm chuffed to bits!

on the whole, the film ""green book"" is an exceptional example of the conception of a masterpiece without spending loads of money in production and without creating plenty of trifling scenarios.

“green book” (2018) was inspired by the real-life story and written by the son of tony lip (mortensen). like all great dramas, it’s compelling from the get-go and the road movie approach provides an entertaining and revelatory string of episodes, not to mention occasionally amusing. while the movie’s been accused of reverse racism, it’s actually balanced, showing plenty of poor, inarticulate blacks and vice versa. the message is to base your perceptions on the individual rather than ignorant generalizations.

6047,"ok, i can see what panos cosmatos is going for; riding the 80s vibe but going for heavy metal instead of synthwave. set in the eighties, there are plenty of references to the cultural conglomerate of the era with glam/speed/heavy metal and fantasy art, b-action machoismo, outsiderness and self-imposed isolation. it is even haunted by the counter culture seventies with the vicious religious hippie cult and their lsd fueled motorcycle gang lackeys. 

though anachronistic, i can see mandy as an attempt of a drone or sludge metal album in a movie format or concert experience, as said were more a nineties evolution. the key elements are there for all senses; excessive slow tempo, cross processed colors, heavy distortions, huge delays and massive reverbs. 

unfortunately it loses itself in this gloss and ends up superficial and pretty with more tiresome slow motion that an entire season of sport of your choice. the story churns from a to b with little character or evolution. the raw expositions become flat and pretentious. the violence that should be shocking becomes a tedious grind without any build up or tension. 

honestly, i wanted to like this movie. i tried to watch it as a art flick by an auteur director, as a hommage to an era and even as a deadpan pastiche. i don't know what i'm missing, because for me it ends up not a denim and studs speedball but rather a pubescent fever dream through an instagram filter.

6071,"can you be said to lead by example when the example is spurious? paul, apostle of christ is the early christianity 'success story' of the conversion of mauritius gallas (olivier martinez), commander of the third legion of rome, and prefect of the mamertine prison.

actually, i’m not even sure mauritius officially converted; he certainly formed a better opinion of christians after saint luke cured his daughter of an indeterminate disease. i guess the filmmakers deserve some credit for not presenting this as a miracle (luke saves the little girl’s life through his medical knowledge), but it really makes no difference anyway because there was no sick child, no mauritius gallas, no third legion, no nothing.

this is a kind of artistic license that goes well beyond the fact that everyone in nero’s rome speaks fluent english (with a french accent, in martinez’s case). mauritius’s conversion (if indeed he converted) doesn’t carry as much weight as, say, that of constantine, and not because the latter was an emperor and the former a humble prefect; the problem is that mauritius’s change of heart doesn’t appears to take place, not as a sign of personal growth, but simply because it’s in the script.

i mean, if you’re just going to make shit up, why stop at one conversion? why not go ahead and make it so that the entire third legion accepted jesus christ into their hearts as their lord and savior?

luke is only slightly less fictional than mauritius, and equally problematic. a ""luke,"" to whom tradition assigns authorship of the gospel of luke and the acts of the apostles, was mentioned by paul in three of his epistles.

the movie depicts luke (jim caviezel) visiting paul (james faulkner) in the rather well-lit ""darkness"" of his cell, where the two commit the acts to paper. why? according to paul, ""[luke] believes people should know the certainties of my life.""

this turns out to be quite an unwittingly ironical statement, considering that a) though the gospel of luke and the acts of the apostles are attributed to the same author, the true identity of this author remains unknown, and b) there are many contradictions between the acts and the authentic pauline letters; thus, in the odd chance luke did in fact pen these books, it’d be safe to say that he and paul weren’t as simpatico as this movie would have us believe (the aforementioned irony, by the way, is completely lost on the filmmakers, according to whom ""paul’s life was well documented by luke"").

6081,"while psychological horror movies seem to be a thing of the past, with movies of this nature cropping up once every little while, _hereditary_ creeps along with the force of looming evil. this isn't an average halloween, popcorn-at-the-theatre moviegoing experience. instead, what we are presented with is palpable heaviness for the better half of two hours while tensions rise in a dwindling household and with some burgeoning satanic undertones encapsulated in some of the darkest, most isolating atmosphere that contends with the likes of _the witch_ and _rosemary's baby_.

toni collette plays annie graham, mother of two children - eldest son in high school, the youngest a girl possibly at the tail-end of middle school. with the recent death of her mother, annie attempts again and again to reconcile with the misfortunes - to put it lightly - that befalls her family. annie's psychological state dances between the forefront of the film, while the backdrop of lingering family turmoil boils to the top.

this is an unrelenting experiment in acceptance, both placed on the key figures in the film, as well as those watching. when watching, keep in mind the word ""control"" and discern whether annie had any at all. this isn't a movie for anybody - i'd go far as to say that this movie isn't for the average moviegoer. there are certain plot points that don't make sense. but if you go into this knowing what the director was trying to do, which, in my opinion, was to make the viewer feel completely uncomfortable while paying homage to some great horror movies, then it will be a rewarding watch.",high

the acting is very good. i have to say though i love toni collette and that was one of the main reasons i watched it. ***spoilers start*** toni collette and alex wolff do an amazing job carrying this movie. after charlie's death, the look on alex's face conveys so much that words are not necessary to understand that shock he is under. there is no overacting or crying or screaming just shock and utter disbelief.***spoilers end*** everyone in the family does an amazing job in their roles. charlie is just so creepy throughout the movie. you empathize with all of them and understand their frustrations even while knowing some of their decisions are just plain wrong.

though there are no conventional jump scares the atmosphere of the movie has you on edge the whole time. there is a building of tension between the family from all things unsaid about their past/current trauma and the grief that they are currently going through that comes to a head. watching this family completely come undone is emotionally heavy but also  has terrifying consequences.

the planet is spectacularly real. the airborne spores can be seen, and we are shown their deadly effect; most of the action takes place while wearing the suits which filter out those deadly spores. this film impressed me mostly for its realism; the suits were well-worn, the spacecraft were also, and much of their equipment had to be jury-rigged to be useful. 

the actors did a great job; cee (sopie thatcher) was a natural, and totally believable, and had good chemistry with ezra (pedro pascal) who really carried the movie; he sometimes reminded me of nathan fillian in firefly. i would've preferred a bit more background on their characters, and a few times i was unimpressed by their emotional reaction to certain events, but those are minor quibbles about an excellent film, which i urge all lovers of hard science-fiction to enjoy, as i certainly did!

- gaspar noé; ""gaspar noé on why his orgiastic cannes sensation climax should be shown to kids: 'it's very educational'"" (kaleem aftab); _the telegraph_ (may 15, 2018)

_climax_, the latest film from argentinian-french provocateur gaspar noé, is a disturbing, depraved, disgusting, and debauched piece of absolute insane genius that i thoroughly adored from beginning to end, and which i never, ever, want to see again.

_lord of the flies_ (1954) by way of heronimus bosch or zdzisław beksiński, _climax_ is what you might get if you mashed-up pier paolo pasolini's _salò o le 120 giornate di sodoma_ (1975), darren aronofsky's _mother!_ (2017), and anne fletcher's _step up_ (2006); a dance movie that morphs into a horror film, which then attempts to show the audience a literal hell on earth. in this sense, it's a perfect fit for noé's oeuvre, focusing as it does on physical disintegration, psychological collapse, and what could be termed ""scorched psyche(s)"". however, considering he is such an infamous figure in world cinema, and considering how honed his overriding thematic preoccupations are, it's strange when you consider that in a career spanning twenty years, noé has directed only four features prior to _climax_; _seul contre tous_ (1998), _irréversible_ (2002), _enter the void_ (2009), and _love_ (2015). if you've seen any of them, you'll know that his reputation for excess and pushing both his characters and his audiences to the extreme is well earned, and with _climax_, he takes that audience and those characters further than ever before. granted, there's nothing here to rival le boucher's sickening attack on his pregnant wife from _seul contre tous_, or the near-unwatchable rape or fire extinguisher scenes from _irréversible_. however, whereas those films feature sudden moments of barbaric violence punctuating (relatively) quotidian narratives, in _climax_, the oppressive feeling of dread is unrelenting, affording the audience not even a moment to drop their guard, as not only is there a possibility that something horrific might be around the corner, chances are something definitely is; once everything kicks off, there is simply no reprieve. so even though the acts of violence are not, in themselves, as extreme as some of those in noé's back-catalogue, the cumulative effect is far worse. obviously, this makes the film something of an endurance test, even at only 96 minutes, but this is precisely the point – noé _wants_ the audience to be utterly exhausted by the end, and he employs numerous confrontational and disorientating techniques to achieve such. disney this most definitely is not.

set in the winter of 1996, and allegedly based on a real incident in france that year, the film focuses on a dance troupe putting the finishing touches to a performance before embarking on a national tour, to be followed by a series of dates in the us. apart from the opening shot, and a couple of quick shots towards the end, the entire film is set in the rehearsal space; an isolated and unoccupied hall. upon finishing rehearsals, the troupe starts to party, with most pairing off to discuss who they've slept with, who they want to sleep with, and who they've unsuccessfully attempted to sleep with, as well as all manner of sexual, drug-related, and hedonistic topics (the conversation about the logistics of anal sex is particularly funny). although we primarily follow selva (sofia boutella), the group's choreographer, several of the others receive a decent amount of characterisation; the troupe's manager emmanuelle (claude gajan maull) who has brought her son, tito (vince galliot cumant), along to rehearsals; selva's best friend, lou (souheila yacoub), who is hiding a secret from the troupe; self-styled ladies' man and ""_walking invitation to an std_"" david (romain guillermic), who is desperate to sleep with selva; daddy (kiddy smile), the troupe's dj; unhappy lesbian couple psyche (thea carla schøtt) and ivana (sharleen temple); and gazelle (giselle palmer), of whom her brother, taylor (taylor kastle), seems a little overprotective. as the night wears on, it becomes apparent that one of their members has spiked the sangria with powerful lsd. briefly remaining lucid enough to begin pointing fingers at one another, they round on the one person who wasn't drinking, omar (adrien sissoko), and throw him out into the snow. however, shortly thereafter, the drug kicks in, and each of the troupe descends into their own personal hades of paranoia, aggression, and/or uninhibited sexuality.

in lieu of any kind of title card or opening credits, _climax_ begins with an abstract and non-descript shot of pure white. so visually indeterminate is the image (it could literally be anything) that at the screening i attended, most people (myself included) didn't even realise the film had begun. scored to the disconcerting and otherworldly sounds of gary numan's ""trois gymnopedies (first movement)"" (1980), it is only as a girl staggers into shot from the top of the frame that it becomes apparent we are looking directly downwards onto a snowfield. the girl, dressed in a black dress, is in great distress, leaving a trail of blood in her wake. after a moment, she collapses onto the snow, her body convulsing, unable to go any further. the camera then revolves upwards along the vertical-axis through 360°, a shot anyone familiar with noé's work will immediately recognise. revealing the bare branches of a few nearby threadbare trees, the movement immediately establishes that we are in an isolated location in the dead of winter. by the time the frame returns to its starting position, the girl's struggles have fashioned a hideously disproportioned and asymmetrical red-tinted snow angel. she struggles for another moment, and then she is still. theoretically, this could be the clichéd opening scene to any generic slasher movie (the innocent and already injured victim desperately trying to get away from the killer, but too exhausted to continue). however, the striking imagistic composition, the economy with which the shot conveys so much information, and the unusual musical choice, all serve to betray the fact that this is not the work of an anonymous journeyman for hire, but is instead the meticulously composed opening salvo of an auteur who knows precisely what he's doing.

a moment after the girl falls still, the film surprised me for the first (and certainly not the last) time, as the entire closing credits roll (upwards, obviously), right to the copyright information. initially, i didn't fully understand the point of this. obviously, the opening shot is, chronologically speaking, pretty late in the narrative, so i was thinking it was just noé being cute, alerting us to the fact that we'd just seen the closing scene. however, it was only when the film ended that i realised the absolute genius of this aesthetic decision; with no closing credits at the end, the audience is allowed no transition from the film to reality, the buffer that we all take for granted is absent, and the effect is startlingly disorientating. as the film ended, the lights immediately popped on, with no music to play us out, no darkened theatre to recompose ourselves, we're just suddenly back in the garish real world, afforded no opportunity to decompress. indeed, to enhance the sense of discombobulation for which noé is obviously striving, the last 15 minutes or so of the film are literally upside-down, with the silhouetted dancers looking like bats hanging from the ceiling (this effect is even extended to an intertitle, which every single person in the theatre tilted their head to try to read). the audience is thus placed in the same position as the characters – the absence of closing credits, and the inverted image create a sense of confusion and discomfort, just as the film is depicting the surviving dancers coming out of their drug-induced mania and back to the real world. as he attempts to do throughout the film, noé places the audience directly into the psychological reality of the characters. this is extraordinarily proficient filmmaking of the highest calibre.

after the opening scene, the film then cuts to a tv screen showing the dancers' audition interviews. surrounding the tv are books and films which announce some of _climax_'s influences, and speak to its genesis. the films include luis buñuel's free-associative surrealist masterpiece, _un chien andalou_ (1929); kenneth anger's surrealist occult film dealing with the thelema religion, _the inauguration of the pleasure dome_ (1954), which, importantly for climax, features footage from the hell sequence in francesco bertolini, adolfo padovan, and giuseppe de liguoro's _l'inferno_, a 1911 adaption of the _inferno_ book from dante alighieri's _divina commedia_; masaki kobatashi's dark samurai film, _harakiri_ (1962); dario argento's dance-hall-based horror film, _suspiria_ (1977); lucio fulci's voodoo/zombie film _zombi 2_ (1979); andrzej żuławski's domestic drama-cum-horror film, _possession_ (1981); and rainer werner fassbinder's serial killer/lgbt film, _querelle_ (1982). the books include franz kafka's 1915 novella, _die verwandlung_, in which a man mysteriously begins to change into an insect; georges bataille's 1928 novella _l'histoire de l'oeil_, which charts the increasingly extreme sexual perversions of a young couple; and pierre petit's 1992 biography of the homosexual and transvestite painter and photographer pierre molinier, _molinier, une vie d'enfer_. this in-your-face intertextuality at the outset of the film very much sets up the tone of the work to come, alerting the audience as to the style and intentions of the filmmakers. aside from that, the interviews also do a terrific job of establishing yourself the differing characters, as do the dialogue scenes after the rehearsal but before the lsd has kicked in.

the next scene is the much-talked-about dance number, which is easily the best dance sequence i've ever seen on film. scored to remixed versions of cerrone's ""supernature"" (1977), patrick hernandez's ""born to be alive"" (1978), and m|a|r|r|s's ""pump up the volume"", the scene is simply breath-taking. shot in a continuous 20 minute take, the dancers move at extraordinary speeds, with no single position held for more than a second or two. i know very little about dance, so i'm unable to really articulate just how extraordinary and original the scene is. i'm also not even sure as to the style of dancing. krumping? waacking? voguing? an amalgamation of all three? the single-take grants the scene a sense of real-time immediacy and in-camera verisimilitude which one can usually only acquire from a live performance – this isn't something constructed by an editor from a series of individual takes, this is something literally happening before our eyes, no cheating, no effects, simply a group of insanely talented and utterly mesmerising performers. put it this way, the dancing is so impressive, if i hadn't known it was being performed by professional dancers, i would be convinced some of it was cgi. indeed, although it's shot in one take, the camera is anything but stationary, moving back and forth, and oftentimes directly above the dancers. in this sense, the viewer is not only watching the dance, they are, in effect, participants. speaking to _the telegraph_, noé states,

> _i wanted the camera to feel like another dancer. we saw the joy of the dancers moving and i wanted to replicate that with the camera moves._

again, he is working to transpose the audience into the world of the film – he doesn't simply show us a dance sequence, he tries to include us in it.

thus ends the first section of the film. the second, and much shorter, section is the dancers engaged in conversation with one another (and, in contrast to the first section, is made up of a multitude of edits eschewing any sense of match-cutting). the third, and longest, section sees selva realise the sangria is spiked, the troupe attempt to find out who did it, and the chaos that ensues when the drugs take hold. these three sections (dance, conversations, and drugs) roughly correspond to the three books of the _divina commedia_ - _paradiso_, _purgatorio_, and _inferno_. however, in the poem, the order is _inferno_, _purgatorio_, and _paradiso_, charting the ascension of the soul from the inferno of hades to the paradiso of spiritual unification with god and christ in heaven. in the film, the movement is in the opposite direction, as the paradiso of the harmonious and unified perfection in the dance sequence gives way to the calm purgatorio after the consumption of the lsd, but before it has taken over their reason. finally, they descend to the inferno – the dance-hall becomes a deadly battleground, a hell on earth, bathed in deep reds and greens, as the entire troupe are overtaken by psychic torment, manifested as physical destruction, with the body itself both the implement of ruination and the primary victim.

in charting this allegorical journey, one of the most immediately interesting things is the obvious visual contrast to the dance sequence. whilst the dance sees the group acting in unison, all of a single mind, the third section of the film shows them fragmented and in disarray, each individual driving towards their own purpose, whether it be paranoia, hedonism, or what they believe they need to do to survive. the harmony of the troupe has given way to the horror of individualised disintegration and psychological collapse. this reminded me a little of the fall of lear, sinking from grandiose threats such as ""_come not between the dragon and his wrath_"" (i.i.130) and ""_the bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft_"" (i.i.152), to his pathetic ""_i am a man more sinned against than sinning_"" (iii.ii.49) and ""_i am a very foolish, fond old man_"" (iv.vii.60) - in the context of the film, the fall from the height of the dance to the bestial nature of the third section is no less epic.

something that bridges the two sections, however, is the music, which literally never stops once the film begins. consisting of a mixture of '80s and '90s electronica and anachronistic early 21st century techno, as the film progresses, and in keeping with the descent into hell, the softer sounds of the dance sequence give way to more intense pieces such as suburban knights' ""the worlds"" (1990), dopplereffekt's ""superior race"" (1995), and aphex twin's ""windowlicker"" (1999), whilst the film closes, bizarrely, with a remix of the rolling stones' ""angie"" (1973).

perhaps the most noticeable similarity between the dance sequence and the third section of the film is that both are shot in single-takes. the drug sequence lasts 42 minutes, and is presented as one continuous shot of the world collapsing in front of the characters' eyes - although in reality, it is several long takes where the edits have been disguised, à la _birdman: or (the unexpected virtue of ignorance)_. following first one character before trading off to someone with whom they have interacted, director of photography benoît debie's (_the runaways_; _spring breakers_; _lost river_) camera moves almost ballet-like throughout the space, sweeping in and around the characters as they fall apart. the lack of any editing, as with the dance sequence, enhances the immediacy of the image, heightening the sense of paranoia from which the entire group are now suffering, and leaving the audience as exposed as the characters themselves.

as the rehearsal space turns into a nightmarish landscape comparable with hans memling's, ""the last judgement"" (1467-1471), pieter bruegel the elder's ""the triumph of death"" (c.1562) and ""dull gret"" (1593), peter paul rubens's ""massacre of the innocents"" (1636-1638), or francisco goya's ""saturn devouring his son"" (1819-1823), the film treats us to a girl's head being set on fire, a pregnant girl being kicked repeatedly in the stomach, a girl slashing her own arm and face, a contortionist contorting to the point where he literally splinters his own bones, a child locked in a room full of cockroaches, a man scratching his chest to the point that it turns into four red bloody streaks, public urination, lesbian rape, incest, and suicide. the troupe descend into a kind of deeply twisted and barbaric gang-mentality, what we might expect if _lord of the flies_ had been written by the marquis de sade, urging one another on to acts of unimaginable and ever-increasing violence and degradation. as the veneer of civilisation is stripped away, the characters devolve before our eyes; some become concerned only with sex, others with violence, whilst a small few try to help their fellow sufferers, although even they ultimately give in to their basest instincts. indeed, noé tells _the telegraph_,

> _it's like the start of 2001, we see the apes and then they evolve into humans, and in the case of my film it is like the humans go back to being apes. humans are going back to their original forces […] lsd or mainly alcohol can bring you back to a more reptilian way of thinking, you are not human anymore. it is all about survival, about reproducing species, about sex and domination. the moment we start losing control of the logical brain we go to a psychotic way of thinking._

but what is it all about? is there any kind of theme underpinning the whole thing, in the same way that _salò_ isn't really about forcing young girls to eat faeces or cutting off boy's tongues, it is actually about (amongst other things) political corruption, the abuse of power, fascism, and economic inequality. it would certainly be easy to dismiss _climax_ as thematically empty, arguing that the brilliant camerawork and pumping soundtrack serve only to cover up the vapidity at its core, to argue that the depravity and excess is not in the service of any grand universal point or allegorical thinking, but simply to show attractive young people tearing one another apart. even if one buys into noé's devolution argument, the idea that the film presents ""man as beast"", it still doesn't offer thematic relevance. so, in a nutshell, is _climax_ shocking for the sake of being shocking?

not exactly.

yes, this is exhibitionist cinema through and through, the type of film that dares you to look at it intently until you can't look anymore, as if the filmmaker is standing behind you saying, ""i knew you'd look away."" but there is definitely more to it than that. for example, there is some kind of political point buried beneath the carnage and broken bodies; the dance sequence takes place in front of a massive french flag, whilst the credits declare, ""_a french film. and proud of it_."" perhaps related to this, the troupe is made up of a cross-section of europeans – gay, straight, men, women, transsexual, black, white, eastern, western. in the explosion of excess hedonism and hysterical mayhem, does this cross-section of ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations come to represent european multiculturalism tearing itself apart? is noé saying that if france continues to accommodate such a diversity of disparate cultures, chaos will ensue? possibly. in this sense, the early parts of the film would represent the liberal ideal of perfect multicultural harmony, whilst the later section is a conservative's wet dream, showing what could happen in such a melting pot. the dance sequence thus represents a politically harmonious multicultural society composed of a barrage of norms and peoples, all working together for the greater good. in relation to this, perhaps tellingly, omar, the person who is initially blamed for spiking the sangria, is muslim (which is how everyone immediately knows he wasn't drinking). is this merely a plot point, or is it part of the larger allegorical canvas?

to flip this argument, is noé saying that in such a multicultural _milieu_, with fear of islam at a high, it's very easy to blame everything on the islamic ""other"". additionally, noé depicts that dance scene with such reverence and awe that this kind of social critique, barely straddling the line between patriotism and xenophobia, doesn't seem to sit especially comfortably. not to mention that noé himself is an immigrant – he was born in argentina, moving to france when he was 13. maybe he's simply criticising the hedonistic youth of today, and their love of excess. however, whilst the political allegory might be reading too much into the film, suggesting the whole thing is simply so noé can proclaim ""kids today"" is reducing it all to a far too simplistic degree. he is no pier paolo pasolini, but neither is he a curmudgeonly old man!

the fact is, i don't have a clue what _climax_ is about. nor do i care. nor is it important. i would argue instead that if you spend the duration of the film trying to figure out what it's all about, then you have missed what it's all about. you can only see the film for the first time once, and it's better to let it carry you into the nether-regions rather than trying to analyse it. with that in mind, i take it for what it appears on the surface; an incredibly technically proficient depiction of a contemporary inferno, as aesthetically impressive as it is morally questionable, as enthralling as it is disturbing, and as evocative as it is shocking, a film of unparalleled barbarism, that also stands as one of the most extraordinary cinematic achievements in recent years.

it's a work of genius. twisted, sick, deraved genius, but genius nonetheless. it disturbed me like no film in at least a decade, and i couldn't get it out of my head for days afterwards. i absolutely loved every single crazy minute of it. and i don't ever wish to see it again. for noé, i can think of no higher compliment.",high

6104,"so, trump is the outsider, right? he wasn't a politician before he ran for president, he started dismissing career politicians, he went to war with corporations.

and the opposition just elected the establishment president, they protested for mega monopolistic corporate tech giant's right to protest. they are really raging for the machine...

... and yet all the 1 star reviews sound like they think they are being anti-establishment while they are backing the establishment.

to me, that is the same as shaving your head and pretending that you have always been punk.

don't get me wrong, i wouldn't compare trump to lincoln... except the gop at the time was the upstart party wasn't it? they ran on the single issue of dismantling the old establishment built on slavery...

... slavery doesn't exist any longer, at least not in the us, at least not legally.... but i can see the essence of the comparison. they were both anti-establishment and, in both cases, the establishment fought back with a vengeance.

and, even then, the south viewed themselves as rebels fighting against the establishment... as they struggled to preserve the establishment of slavery.

idk, whatever, imdb has a problem with censoring anything that isn't a far left review of things like this, so, i'll probably get rejected, and no one will ever read this.

but, in both cases, the establishment fought back, the establishment used violence. the only real difference is that the civil war was a traditional war, and this uprising seems to be closer to ireland's troubles and just as partisan.",high
6109,"motherless brooklyn’s lead performance recalls two previous ed norton outings: primal fear and the score. in the latter two, norton plays, respectively, a cold-blooded killer posing as a stuttering altar boy, and a thief posing as a mentally-challenged janitor; in the former, he plays lionel essrog, a private investigator with tourette’s syndrome. 

the key difference is that lionel really does have tourette’s and isn’t just pretending. in  primal fear and the score there is a performance-within-a-performance, with the character pulling a sun tzu and appearing weak when he’s strong in order to achieve an ulterior goal. conversely, there is no means-to-an-end scenario in motherless brooklyn; the protagonist’s handicap is genuine, and while norton does this medical condition justice like only he can, it sadly turns out to be a hindrance not only for the character, but also the actor, the movie, and even the audience.

there is enough material here for two films, and norton, who writes, produces, and directs, neglects to edit; perhaps he should have been as involved in his own movie’s cutting process as he was in american history x’s, instead of leaving the responsibility to the undistinguished joe klotz. the first film follows an individual with tourette’s as he juggles his disorder, his job, and his personal relationships. the second, which doesn’t need the tourette’s angle, involves a murder mystery that takes us from harlem’s jazz clubs to brooklyn’s slums to the drawing rooms of the rich and powerful. norton would have done well to focus on the first story; first, because of his performance, which strikes a prodigious balance between tactful and funny. and second, because tourette isn’t the film’s only malady; the plot, such as it is, is a dull intrigue concerning urban renewal and housing relocation – and outside an 80s family comedy wherein the gang must save the old people’s home from being torn down to make room for a parking lot, it is near impossible to take an urban planner seriously as a credible villain, even if he’s played by alec baldwin; here’s one turd that not even he can polish.

baldwin is not the only talented performer whose talent goes to waste here, though. ethan suplee, dallas roberts, and leslie mann show up to push the plot forward, hang around for a couple more scenes, and then disappear without a trace; all of their characters, especially mann’s, could have been replaced with a little timely exposition. at least bruce willis has the decency to die after setting the events of the movie in motion.

motherless brooklyn shows much more ambition than norton’s previous directorial credit, which was also his debut: the romantic comedy keeping the faith. that’s the good news. the not-so- good news is that he remains a greater actor than he is a director and scriptwriter. his performance here is flawless, but that doesn’t change the fact that his character has been overwritten.

overall, the film would be neither better nor worse with or without the whole tourette’s syndrome stuff, and that leaves us with a feature-length picture where the length has gotten out of hand, and that only rises above mediocrity during willem dafoe’s all-too-brief interventions. unlike norton, dafoe is able to convey mental instability more subtly; not with a stutter but with a tone of voice, not in the way he looks but in the way he looks at others. he slow-burns until he reaches the boiling point, and when he does it’s beautiful and terrifying at the same time. his is the most well-rounded character in the movie, and that’s likely more dafoe’s doing than norton’s.",low

unfortunately, 'countdown' quickly descends into your standard cheese eg. jump scares, silly monsters that come and get you. too much of the unknown malevolence is revealed too soon - and the mystery, suspense and most importantly scariness falls by the wayside. fear lies in the unknown and what your own mind can conjure up. unfortunately, not many filmmakers appear to realize this anymore... but that's not what killed this movie.

**spoilers!**
just about every mainstream movie and tv show made nowadays is filled with political messaging; some more overt than others, but if you know what to look for you'll see it.  
i was really hoping this one could just stick to telling a story, where i could sit back for 90 minutes and watch our protagonist ""quinn"" race against the countdown to avoid certain death, as opposed to having political messages shoved down my throat and endure yet more anti-white attacks, insults and repugnance. shamefully, 'countdown' joins that growing list of cultural marxist propaganda. that's what destroyed this movie for me.

now not all of these instances alone i'm about to provide are proof of cultural marxism. it's the contrast of having a false representation forcibly repeated with agenda driven consistency and how they're programming us to believe that these representations are real-world norms. 
generally observable group behaviors, patterns and actions are no longer being characterized and instead misrepresented; even inverted in media. stereotypes are ""no longer politically correct,"" regardless whether they're accurate or fair. alternatively, these real-life human traits and personas are being distorted not only in fiction but the real world for a political agenda.

the propaganda that's occurring throughout the majority of media now has a real-life impact and consequences. in other words; our understanding of real-world actions, events and moral standards are being corrupted and manipulated through media.

some examples:

* ""evil white man"" as doctor sullivan the sociopath and sexual predator. [whites with fair hair and blue eyes are increasingly portrayed as evil villains and wrongdoers; untrustworthy and treacherous. often with english, german or eastern european accents].
* ""good & heroic black man."" in contrast noble matt is a perfect gentleman and sensitive boyfriend material. [black and brown performers are often now given the role of hero or good doer. courageous and virtuous; trustworthy and loyal].
* white male bashing and anti-white remarks. the line by matt: _""i just found out i'm gonna die and i don't mind taking a white man with me.""_ imagine if the roles were reversed?
* miscegenation. predictably a blue-eyed, blonde girl with a black man. race-mixing propaganda is everywhere you look now. film, tv, advertising etc. diversity means: 'without whites,' particularly straight, white males. the more diversity there is, the fewer white people they'll be.
* more white male bashing & conspiracy theorist attacks. a drunk at the bar becomes a test subject because he's talking about antarctica and ""flat earth."" matt wants to get him to download the app so they can read the terms & conditions and quinn doesn't feel good about it. 
of course, once the drunk mentions the taboo subject you're not allowed to question, 'the holocaust,' quinn changes her mind and promptly tells matt to go ahead. bear in mind the protagonist, quinn is supposed to be a caring, ethical nurse!
* quinn and matt share an interracial kiss in front of her teenage sister and she looks on approvingly. [the younger the age one can start receiving programming & conditioning, the better. this has been proven with declassified mind control experiment files].
* in a scene at the end credits 'tech nerd' derek is on his tinder date and acts like a complete ass and turn-off to his date. if only she'd chosen the ""more desirable"" non-white date instead?!

now that i've pointed out some examples of cultural marxism and anti-white propaganda you'll begin to notice them everywhere - that's if you haven't already. hope this review helps and you got to swallow a few red pills in the process! thanks for reading.

**'countdown'** is more subversive cultural marxist anti-white propaganda with a story that could have been good if done right.",low

i like to think of asian cinema as having a few very distinct markets. there’s the japanese – known for their horror, monster and obscure movies. south east asia gives us very distinct gory horrors and action films, while china, hong kong and taiwan give us a mish-mash of genres – good action films, good horror films, but bland comedies and movies with mostly incoherent storylines.

but korea gives us something more unique – essentially the asian version of hollywood. remarkable horror films like the host and train to busan, popular romantic comedy movies like my sassy girl, interest award films like parasite – and of course the outstanding sympathy trilogy in old boy and sympathy for mr and lady vengeance.

but korean thrillers are something else entirely. and if you enjoyed the spectacular i saw the devil – then i am confident you will love every second of the gangster the cop the devil.

6142,"if you enjoy reading my spoiler-free reviews, please follow my blog :)

usually, i leave the technical aspects to the end of my reviews since story, characters, and the critical element of each genre (action in action flicks, comedy in comedies, and so on) are way more important. however, having in mind the whole marketing campaign surrounding gemini man's ""groundbreaking innovations"", i'll address them now. even after sleeping on it, my experience in high frame rate still feels very … weird. in case you need some explaining, hfr adds a lot more detail to the image since it captures more frames per second hence making the image smoother, which can be extremely distracting. i always disable motion smoothing on my tv since i hate that feeling of knowing that ""something's not right"".

it doesn't have to do with speed, which is something people are going to wrongly state regarding this film. the action isn't faster, don't make the mistake of saying this. since there's 2.5x more detail (24 fps is the standard frame rate), movements become easier to follow, so there's the illusion of watching something faster than normal. truth is, it just feels like it. when characters are just talking, and there's no action involved, it works because it simply looks better. however, the action sequences are very hit-and-miss. some pieces look absolutely amazing, but it's clear this technology needs a few more years of experience to reach its full potential.

scenes featuring car/motorbike chases, running, or shootings are stunningly filmed, but any hand-to-hand combat is frustratingly off-putting. additionally, ang lee applies an excessive use of cgi to a lot of these moments, which makes some fights look incredibly absurd. hfr is not the only technical attribute people are going to discuss. that young version of will smith … honestly, it doesn't really work for me. people who complained about the lion king (2019) not being able to show animals emoting will surely hate this attempt of replicating a young will smith (if they don't, then joker was right, society is indeed extremely hypocritical).

it's just like the action sequences with hfr: hit-and-miss. there are some genuinely mind-blowing scenes with medium shots of young will smith, and he looks 99.9% real. in these specific shots, it's impossible to tell the difference between the clone and a real version. however, it still fails to deliver this realism throughout the entire runtime. first of all, young henry barely shows any emotions (except a brilliant crying moment), which is obviously meant to facilitate the vfx team's work. but even with his face completely still and empty of emotions, the eyes just look too doll-like. the eyebrows move strangely, and the forehead seems odd.

in the end, it all comes down to forgetting that it's a digital character and that almost never happens. i always felt like i was watching a blend of cgi, motion-capture, and whatever other technology they used to try to pull this off. in a few years from now, if gemini man gets a remake or some other movie tries to do something similar, i bet it will look near-perfect. right now, it's more of a disturbance than an achievement. put this together with the already not-that-good hfr, and we get a visually striking yet distracting film.

and if you thought the story would save it… it's pretty bad. generic, predictable, and filled with almost offensive exposition. i would have to go through my reviews, but this is definitely one of the most exposition-heavy screenplays of the year. i lost count of the number of times a character starts ranting with the purpose of explaining something evident to another character. the worst thing a screenplay can do is treat the audience like they are 5-year-old children. the whole plot revolves around people asking someone else what happened, what's happening, and what's next. we already know from the trailer will smith is being hunted by a young version of himself, a clone.

try to imagine how many ways you can tell someone there's an individual exactly like that person. now, just lazily insert all of those sentences on a character's script and make it say them in a single scene. i'm sorry, but it's laughably bad. there are no surprises! it ends abruptly, utterly disregarding the only interesting plot point (still very predictable), by not developing it any further than one sequence. if it wasn't for the truly fantastic cast (will smith is always impeccable, mary elizabeth winstead and benedict wong deliver great performances), gemini man would easily be one of the absolute worst movies of the year. shoutout to lorne balfe's score, which is by far the technical aspect worthy of only compliments.

all in all, ang lee's attempt to deliver a groundbreaking film doesn't quite hit the mark. honestly, it's still far from it. the 60 fps hfr and the young version of will smith are occasionally jaw-dropping, but both technical aspects need years of improvement to be able to work seamlessly. as of now, these only serve as a frustrating distraction. however, the biggest problem with gemini man is its exposition-heavy screenplay, which besides treating the audience like dumb people, doesn't carry any sort of surprise or novelty. as generic and predictable as it could be. the unbelievably talented cast, a spectacular score from lorne balfe, and a few notable action sequences save this technological hit-and-miss from missing its target entirely.

6157,"so i'm going ahead and giving this 10 out of 10 stars, not because i think it deserves it, but because there is a 1 star review entitled ""white supremacy is cancer"" and that seems to be the concept of a lot of negative reviews.

however, i have actually seen it and i can 100% guarantee that it has nothing to do with the content of those reviews. none of that is mentioned or implied.

however, there are negative reviews that ultimately say that this is not a rambo film... and that is fair. if you compare it to rambo first blood part ii, iii, and rambo the 1 star reviews make sense. it is not at all like 2-4... so if you are expecting a rambo like the sequels you're probably not going to like it... but you are probably not going to like it for entirely fair reasons.

i won't fault you for that negative review.

it's a lot more like the first film. more like rambo first blood... only instead of the military it's a drug cartel and instead of chasing rambo he's... kind of... chasing them.... kind of... for revenge.

like all the other rambo movies, it's formulaic. once more we start off with rambo trying to get out of the business, and this time he has gotten out and been adopted as an ""uncle"" by a latino family.

and to follow the formula, like in the godfather, he gets pulled back in. this time the daughter of said latino family leaves to track down her family, goes to cartel occupied mexico, and gets promptly kidnapped, sending rambo on a blood crazed path to get her back and deliver vengeance on the cartels.

unlike the sequels, however, it's a little more of a slow burner. it takes a little more time to set up the characters, it takes a little more time to set up the plot and the relationships, and (shockingly given that in most of the rambo films the enemy is almost faceless he's so under-developed) it actually takes a little time to set up the heavy as well.

and in the end there is a lot of killing, a lot of elderly action, and ultimately a lot of fun... but what there is not a lot of is political messaging... because, at it's heart, it's just another action movie.

which leads me to the third type of negative review... the reviews critical of it being an action movie... those i don't understand... it's a rambo movie, you know exactly what it is... and action movie... so what kind of film did they think they were going to see?",high

i like the addams family, conceptually, and i enjoy the live action movies, but this seems maximize everything i dislike about the addams family and minimize all the things i do like.  and even then, the movie is widely inconsistent.  it basically does whatever it wants whenever it wants without regard to the established rules.

this was something that the previous iterations did with some finesse, they always left some mystery to what the rules were, but it never contradicted itself.

the aesthetic alone feels pretty grating, and they use it as an excuse to do things that don't make any sense to facilitate the gags, but it again eludes what makes the addams family special, that it is weird and crazy things happening in reality.

while i do like the attempt to modernize the movie, it ruins some great potential to extend the universe and create new characters in the next generation of things: something more movies need to do.

despite not being a big fan of track car racing - i’m more of a rally man - the chance to see matt damon and christian bale lead in a true life story attracted me to _ford v ferrari_. it’s a very good movie that tells the tale of the development of ford’s race program to topple ferrari as the champions of le mans. 

here’s the official description:

_american car designer carroll shelby and the british-born driver ken miles work together to battle corporate interference, the laws of physics, and their own personal demons to build a revolutionary race car for ford motor company and take on the dominating race cars of enzo ferrari at the 24 hours of le mans in france in 1966._

i’ll say up front that even though ferrari is mentioned in the title, they don’t really play a huge part in the movie. i was expecting things to bounce between each camp as they tried to one up each other in the race for glory. while ferrari are here and there throughout, the main battle of the movie is shelby and miles trying to get their work done amidst the interference from factions within ford’s management. 

it still makes for a great story though, and it’s a movie that takes you on a ride of many highs and lows. from technological failures and success, to corporate shenanigans, to father-son moments, this hits so many beats that it kept us entertained the whole way through. not only does it hit them, it does them very very well. there were some moments where i was genuinely holding my breath. it’s great stuff. 

even from a technical point of view there is a lot to love about this. the cinematography was a stand out for me - some of the sunset shots were stunning, as were the very intense race sequences. i’m sure there’s cgi all through this but it was of such a good quality that it was barely noticeable. 

damon and bale are outstanding and lead from the front, with bale in particular seeming to inhabit the role and transform, as he so often does. even all the side characters bring their a game and the end result is a pleasure to watch. 

this is an excellent film, it’s the whole package and feels like a real film as opposed to much of the cookie cutter movies we get a lot of these days.

i thoroughly enjoyed this and highly recommend it.",high

to me, it just seems a little more music video than movie. and, this was elton john, dude is interesting enough (especially given that he has been musically relevant for about 50 consecutive years), that they could have made it more... real i guess?

guillermo del toro's pair of hellboy movies were always pretty acclaimed by both critics and audience. so, if a reboot was in the works, it had to be way different from the originals or, at least, capable of separating itself from them. neil marshall's film is definitely distinct, but not in a good way. sadly, this is one of the worst movies of the year, so far. david harbour tries super hard to bring this story to safe haven, but his outstanding performance can't fight back all of the painfully long and repetitive exposition dumps, an editing worthy of a razzie award (if they had such a category), and cringe-worthy comedy bits.

the trio of writers failed in almost everything. even hellboy, as a character, becomes a caricature of himself at one point. milla jovovich, who is not a bad actress at all, offers such an over-the-top display that only comes off as cliche, cheesy, and the complete opposite of menacing. obviously, her extremely villainous script doesn't help. sasha lane (alice) is the only one who actually portrays a likable character (excluding the protagonist) and delivers a compelling performance. daniel dae kim is also good as ben daimio. unfortunately, a talented cast is not enough to overcome the undeniable screenplay issues, which tells a convoluted story, filled with heavy exposition through annoying flashbacks (i lost count of how many there are).

the rock'n'roll score doesn't always work, becoming uneven and making some transitions just weird. however, credit where credit is due, it does make the action sequences a lot cooler. there are some great action moments where hellboy shines, but overall they are ruined by sloppy editing. honestly, i don't know how marshall can direct such beautiful one-take fights (or ""stitched one-take"" sequences, like one towards the end) and horribly edited ones in the same film, so many times. the visual effects disappoint as much as they impress, but hellboy's makeup and costume are, at least, on-point. in the end, the story and the characters are the two pillars of any movie, and hellboy fails to deliver a well-written and captivating adventure, as well as compelling characters.

all in all, hellboy is a huge misstep in neil marshall's filmmaking career and he's going to have to work hard to get another opportunity at a blockbuster. his film is already suffering losses at the box-office, which proves that the interest in the reboot of this franchise is not big enough to warrant a sequel. admittedly, it has its good moments and david harbour embodies his character seamlessly, carrying the movie for as long as he can. nevertheless, a good cast and some occasionally cool action sequences are not enough to fight back writing issues, uneven soundtrack, cheesy comedy, heavy exposition dumps, and the worst editing i've witnessed this year, so far. it's a headache that most people might not find worthy of the price of admission...

6212,"if guillermo del toro’s version of hellboy is the imaginative grand symphony, this version is the discordant heavy metal little brother. based on “the wild hunt” and “the storm and the fury” storylines in the comics doesn’t save it, either.

lacking the del toro’s vision, the character and monster designs are pedantic at best. david harbour plays the titular infernal hero and while at first the costume design seems grittier than ron perlman’s hellboy, it becomes clear very quickly that, while perlman became the character and almost seemed to meld with his costume, harbour seems to be fighting his costume. it’s like watching one of the most uncomfortable and anxiety-ridden wrestling matches one can imagine. i kind of felt sorry for harbour as he’s a good actor with the right material, but he got handed such terrible material to work with. to his credit, it’s clear that he does try to sell it, but when you’re selling crap, it’s still crap.

the characters come off more as caricatures. their relationships are so basic and one-dimensional even if they exist that we find that we don’t really care. and that’s the major problem. the stakes aren’t built up enough to make us care. it’s a good versus evil comic-book film and we don’t really care whether the good guys live or if the bad guys win. making the audience care and identify with the characters should be the bread and butter of “hellboy.” instead, we’re given a cracker and told to run along and play.

don’t bother unless you are a major fan of the comics or the actors and simply have to see it. even then, you might want to consider steering clear as it could taint your love for these.",low
6213,"i went into this movie with low expectations. ron perlman was my perfect hellboy. david harbour was so good i hardly noticed a difference which is saying a lot. i think david put in a lot of research and work into trying to be a little bit like ron but he also made this part very much his own. i actually found myself liking his version so much better because it felt more solid. it captured the spirit of what hellboy is supposed to be. i truly did enjoy this movie from start to finish. beautiful visuals, story was very decent, the lore was very interesting... i would recommend this movie for anybody who liked the previous hellboy movies even if you like ron as hellboy please consider giving david a chance because he kills it in so many good ways.",high
6214,"horrible.

""if humans didn't kill monsters, maybe monsters wouldn't be that bad.""

i guess, maybe, the good thing i can say about this movie is that, if you are part of the ""everything has to be political all the time,"" crowd...it injects the obligatory the last jedi woke politics...just to make sure everyone won't complain that there wasn't a political injection in a super hero movie.

but then, that's kind of a trope of all bad movies lately.

really though, from the start it makes a point to bore the audience to death with not one, but fiver separate introductions that drag on for far to long and introduce us to concepts and characters that have, well, absolutely nothing to do with the movie.

and then to rush it's way through the second act--that the audience probably would have been interested in if they hadn't rushed their way through it, assuring that, by the time the conclusion comes around everyone is sufficiently bored and irritated enough not to care or really even be amused at what should be the bulk of the action and the most exciting part of the film.

in other words, it's the type of movie that people are tempted to walk out of.",low
6220,"well... this was another sequel that no one asked for, at all and we can probably honestly say that this is a huge reason why it flopped.

i had absolutely no interest in seeing another sequel of mib, especially one without will smith, and especially one that is gender-swapped and rests closer to the reboot mark than the remake mark.

which are all reasons why i didn't see it until it came around for free.

and as predicted while all but rebooting the franchise, it also attempts to make a political statement with the jokes coming from ""laugh because you agree with this"" type of humor, which rarely actually lands. and as a result it feels like snl doing mib in a sequel no one asked for.",low

6242,"it’s hard to write a review for this film without any major spoilers, so this might seem a little vague here and there. there will be very minor spoilers, primarily what’s revealed in the opening text crawl or the trailers, so not much, but if you want to go into this film completely virgin, stop here.

the film starts off with things already underway. a transmission has been sent out that contains the voice of emperor palpatine. kylo ren, now supreme leader of the first order, goes to seek out palpatine as a potential threat to his power. in the meantime, the resistance is still in shambles after the events of “the last jedi,” and they are busy doing scouting missions and regrouping.

all of this is revealed in the opening crawl of the movie, which is where the problems begin. it violates a cardinal rule of storytelling: show, don’t tell. it wouldn’t have taken much to have this done on screen in more dramatic and effective fashion. instead, this has the effect of making it feel like we either missed something important or that we’re watching an entirely different movie with a different story. this makes things confusing. it doesn’t help that i was already thinking that j.j. abrams probably needs to go back to screenwriting 101 during the opening crawl. not a good way to start.

other things happen during the course of the movie that make no sense. why does kylo ren reforge his helmet? we never really find that out. he just does. the knights of ren do appear in this film finally. who are they? if you’re expecting an answer of any kind, you’ll be disappointed. why is there this strange connection between rey and kylo ren? one of the mysteries of the force, i suppose. characters who we don’t know appear from nowhere having been significant to the goings on even though we’ve never seen them before. other characters take bizarre and up to now not even hints at character arcs. it becomes a horrendously confusing mess.

i liked some of the more controversial aspects of “the last jedi.” rey being a nobody with no significant parentage? great idea! the galaxy is a big place. why does everyone have to be related? well, this is adjusted slightly. i won’t go into details, but it was disappointing what they did, in my opinion. leia’s story arc in this film is...weird. i’m going to allow that it’s due to the loss of carrie fisher and having to use archival footage (one scene that shows a young luke and leia using computer effects is freaky at best). but it’s off-putting and feels tacked on for convenience. it was nice to see lando return, although even that felt more like throwing a bone to the fans. he could have potentially been replaced by any character with flying skills. speaking of such, wedge does make finally make an appearance, but it’s a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment.

here’s how i would sum it up spoiler-free: as i said, i liked “the last jedi” a lot, including parts that many didn’t like or found weird as i stated above, but at the same time it was not a problem-free movie for me. “the rise of skywalker” is the exact opposite. it definitely has some really cool moments, but feels so sloppy and makes so many storytelling mistakes that, on the whole, i have to say that it’s a bad movie. i’ve said this about just about everything i’ve seen come from j.j. abrams, that he’s great at coming up with interesting imagery. he gets these pictures in his head of something that would be really interesting to see on film, like flashes one might remember from a dream. for example, there’s a great scene near the end that finally corrects what many consider a great injustice done in an earlier movie. but couching these images in a cohesive story is not his strong suit. in fact, he’s downright terrible at it. this problem seemed to be going in full force in “the rise of skywalker.”

were some of my complaints addressed in some expanded material? i don’t know, but even if they were it would still make it bad storytelling. star wars has always been fairly good about keeping things self-contained. expanded material adds extra background to enhance the enjoyment of the main material, like adding seasoning, but shouldn’t be necessary to appreciate the meal.

overall, you need to see this movie to close out the skywalker saga, but that’s really the only reason. don’t go into this expecting a good or even decent film, or for every question to be answered. ultimately, it’s a disappointing end to star wars, and i say this as a star wars fan.",low
6245,"5 reasons **you'll** love this movie:

**you** can't spoil the plot to anyone who hasn't seen it, because it doesn't have a plot.  sure, stuff happens, and if you blab about it, you'll get asked ""who did what? when? why?"", and you won't be able to answer because you won't know either.

it validates **your** blind optimism over everyone else's cool deliberation, because our so-called heroes just blunder their way through every peril imaginable without any logic, strategy or preparedness, yet they come out unscathed for [reasons].  often using guesswork, or was that ""the force""?

no need for **you** to remember any complicated story arcs, bothersome subtle clues or dramatic prophecy drops from throughout the series, because this final movie just makes up completely new stuff that you couldn't possibly have seen coming because it never existed before.

it's ridiculously easy to re-enact the movie at **your** next cosplay gathering, because the characterisations are so shallow and vapid that all you need to do is ad-lib the actors' lines, and you'll probably get a better script.

all that junk **you've** accumulated over the years will come in damn handy one day, just like it did for our so-called heroes.  they managed to have everything they need on hand.  so much so, that vitally important junk literally materialises right in front of them, and usually from places that makes you wonder why they never noticed it years ago.",low
6246,"this movie is really awesome. it took me two viewings to truly cement the way i truly feel about this film. but upon second viewing this film was not just an entertaining blast from start to finish but to be honest a perfect conclusion to the skywalker story. the film traverses the stories of the previous films in order to bring all those stories together for a culmination that is truly satisfying. the cinematography and visual effects as usual are outstanding in the film but this film seems to have a unique feel that adds to the foreboding tone kept consistent throughout. adam driver and daisy ridley as rey and kylo truly shine in this film and are both giving their a - game and prove that they are both incredible actors and extremely emotionally flexible (particularly ridley). the arc of kylo ren is by far the highlight of this trilogy and in this film and the conclusion of said arc is immensely satisfying, reys story also takes a surprising turn which i found immensely satisfying in hindsight. as a conclusion to my favourite series of all time i was left immensely pleased with the final sequence of the film which brings all of this lore together in a way i couldn’t predict to be this poignant. this film overall was a wonderful farewell to this saga that was so satisfying and enjoyable that i will look back on this saga with great nostalgia and adoration that i hope to show my children as a whole nine part saga and i am immensely honoured to have been part of this moment in pop culture and to get to view this conclusion is a truly wonderful thing for me. it’s with this i farewell the galaxy far far away with immense satisfaction.",high
6249,"“do it!”

i’m surprised they added that in there despite all the memes.

anyway…

a long time ago...four years to be distinct; the space opera ‘star wars’ returned to cinemas with ‘the force awakens', that brought back the bittersweet experience that fans have been craving for over 30 years. well lets just say christmas was magical that year. while i wasn’t quite as wowed as everyone else, but i still enjoyed it otherwise and i was interested where the story will go after j.j. abrams left his “mystery box” of questions for another director to answer. how exciting and epic the next years will be.

and then the sequel and two spin-offs happened. well lets just say my interest for these new movies has completely evaporated. sad times indeed. and no i don’t feel like i’m being overly negative in the heat this movie is receiving, because right now, at this very moment, my thoughts and overall feeling on this movie are genuine, and re-watching it isn’t going to safe it. i’m not disappointed or angry, because at this point i stopped caring.

‘rise of skywalker’ is a factory made movie with no heart, no soul, and no magic. words and phrases like: bold, epic, and satisfying - are not the type of words that i would describe this final chapter in the skywalker saga. i can’t call something bold if it played things incredibly safe. each movie exists just to shred up and apologize for what came before it.

j.j. abrams can be hit or miss sometimes, but i must admit he had a difficult task to follow up on ‘last jedi’ and rian johnson undoing his mystery box questions. if that wasn’t bad enough, the death of carrie fisher also had a massive effect on the story, and including her into the movie, while respecting her legacy and giving her as much screen time with the limited deleted footage they have. abrams sadly treads on familiar ground and doesn't really handle the originals (or even the prequels) with respect. this is literally a remake of ‘return of the jedi’.

the story in this movie is almost nonexistent. it’s so rushed that you can’t catch a breather amidst the chaos. nothing flows naturally. characters running around and jumping from location to location. i think the quick pace easily hides the poor writing and plot holes. i also thought the title crawl is a bit off and felt it was written by a reddit user. from the moment the movie starts until it ends nothing makes a lick of sense.

i think the biggest waste of opportunity is the character of finn, because the potential of greatness was set up in ‘the force awakens’, and they didn’t do a single thing with it. i mean, a stormtrooper who revolt against the corrupt and sinister empire, which is something we haven’t seen before. heck, a long time ago he held a lightsaber. unfortunately in this movie he’s a comedic buffoon that sweats and shouts a lot. what a waste of john boyega’s talent. they did him dirty.

i like daisy ridley, not so much on rey. i don’t want to jump on any bandwagon here, but i don’t understand how someone can be so over powered and skillful at the force with barely any training. whenever there is training it’s over before you know it. there was a point where i said to myself, “who taught her to do that?”, or “how the hell did she do that?”. i really struggled to emotionally connect with rey, because there’s nothing more dull than a character with no flaws or growth.

the strongest element throughout these three movies was kylo ren by the magnificent adam driver. this guy literally carried this series on his back. at least his character as an arc, and not just wasted potential. i actually connected with his inner conflict between the dark side and the light side.

the cinematography looks beautiful and absolutely striking. the visuals and music will always be great with these movies regardless on the actual movie.

emperor palpatine is back...for some reason. the vague explanation of why he’s back made it clear to me that disney had no plan from the start for these new movies. still, ian mcdiarmid is fantastic as always. he oozes with evil and soaks up every wicked moment of it.

the awkward and ill-placed comedy from ‘last jedi’ is still present and it got worse and worse as it went along. with this being the finale, new characters still get introduce and get some development. like, why are you introducing new characters now? billy dee williams returns as the slick and classy lando, but sadly doesn't really do much for the story. richard e. grant is great as the ruthless new commander of the first oder with the small screen time he has. dominic monaghan, on the other hand, feels like an extra. rose tico has a smaller role this time around and her entire love triangle with finn from ‘last jedi’ gets brush under the carpet. kelly marie tran sure can’t catch a break.

the action sequences with the lightsaber fights and space battles were mostly forgettable. even the scenes that stick to mind wasn’t that special. the camera fails to capture focal points with the grand scale lacking.

i like how there’s a lesbian couple towards the end that’s on screen for about two seconds. so when the studio want to market the movie for china, they could easily edit out it to make it more “marketable”. how progressive disney.

overall rating: an unsatisfying conclusion. at least ‘the mandalorian’ is good.",low
6251,"when it comes to “star wars,” being a fan comes first and a film critic comes second. i was four years old when i saw the original, and i’ve been a huge devotee of all things in the galaxy for forty plus years. this isn’t a review written by a disgruntled fan, as i have grown to love rey, poe, and bb-8 almost as much as han solo, luke skywalker, and r2-d2. but when a movie is so careless with its beloved characters both past and present, it’s something that can’t be ignored.

the skywalker saga comes to its disappointing end in this (supposedly) final chapter. the recycled story is basic and mostly predictable, as the surviving resistance rallies together to face the first order for one final battle. so much is shoved into this movie that it feels like a pressure cooker that’s being forced to tell a too-rushed story. it becomes frustrating early on.

i realize “star wars” is a touchy subject and fans will always be debating the films until the end of time, but “the rise of skywalker” is one of the more mediocre entries in the series. from the reveal of rey’s (daisy ridley) origins to the head-scratching actions of kylo ren (adam driver) to the disappointing conclusions for hux (domhnall gleeson), finn (john boyega), and poe’s (oscar isaac) stories, this thing stinks to high heaven. almost everyone does things that are totally out of character, events happen that make absolutely no sense within the lucas-created universe, it seems like more questions are raised than are answered, and new rules of what the jedi can and can’t do seem to be made up on the fly because they make for convenient story arcs.

i’m not usually a literal filmgoer but this movie is so poorly plotted that its myriad problems are too abundant to ignore. since this is a spoiler-free review i can’t divulge them here, but those who’ve seen the film will be able to name at least half of the dozen or so massive problems within seconds.

particularly shameful is the inexcusable way rose (kelly marie tran), who was a major character in “the last jedi,” is discarded like trash and relegated to a very minor background role in this film. perhaps a defense could be constructed that she didn’t quite fit into this part of the journey, but i say hogwash. this is absolutely a decision that feels like it was done to appease angry internet fanboys who screamed and howled about tran and her character behind the anonymity of their keyboards. kowtowing to bullies is a colossal setback to the very themes that root the “star wars” franchise.

further aggravating to life-long fans is the sparse emotional connection that stems from the film’s many fakeouts. there are zero consequences to the movie’s most shocking moments. it’s a crappy thing to do because it assures a near-complete loss of trust from your audience. for every gasp-inducing jolt and hold-for-tears touching moment, a sense of betrayal almost always follows.

even worse is the quality of the filmmaking. this movie is so poorly shot it’s shocking, and director j.j. abrams, who did a terrific job with “the force awakens,” is again in the driver’s seat. only this time instead of keeping an unflappable composure behind the wheel, he’s swerving in and out of traffic at such a high speed that he spins out of control and careens off the nearest cliff.

“rise of the skywalker” is broadly entertaining, but it’s not a good movie. it’s the year’s biggest letdown.",low

6258,"**_a hilarious piece of political satire that isn't afraid to be serious_**

>_the great danger of lying is not that lies are untruths, and thus unreal, but that they become real in other people's minds._

- christine leunens; _caging skies_ (2004)

we live in dangerous times. in this era of political regression, racists, xenophobes, neo-nazis, white supremacists, white separatists, and fascists, once confined to the periphery of civilised society, have wormed their way back into the cultural mainstream, preaching hate and intolerance under the guise of terms such as ""nationalism"" and ""patriotism"". meanwhile, politicians validate such groups by doing precisely nothing to curtail them and refusing to condemn them (""_very fine people on both sides_"" and so forth). far-right political parties have gained worrying footholds in numerous european countries, running on populist platforms of islamophobia and anti-immigration, playing on peoples' fears of the other, exploiting the dearth of facts in sociopolitical discourse, and trading in disinformation (and the less said about the current administrations in the us and uk, the better). anti-establishment political rage is on the increase, as hordes of people disavow traditional centrism; think of brexit, the election of donald trump, the _movimento 5 stelle_ in italy, the _alternative für deutschland_ in germany. scholars and sociocultural anthropologists have posited that hateful right-wing ideologies are more validated now than at any time since the rise of fascism in places such as italy in 1922 and spain in 1936. and the best known example of this kind of fascist thinking, of course, is the third reich in germany, beginning with the rise to power of adolf hitler in 1933.

and so, it's entirely fitting that a film set in this very _milieu_, which argues that love, tolerance, and kindness can defeat hateful indoctrination, has come along at this precise moment; because although this is a film set in germany in 1945, it's really about the here and now. based loosely on the 2004 novel _caging skies_ by christine leunens, _jojo rabbit_ is a political satire written and directed by new zealand filmmaker (and polynesian jew) taika waititi (_eagle vs shark_; _what we do in the shadows_; _hunt for the wilderpeople_; _thor: ragnarok_). courting significant controversy when it was announced (a comedy about nazis? for shame. especially when one considers that the novel is deadly serious) and sharply dividing critics upon release, the film has proven a significant hit with audiences, and has just scored an impressive six academy award nominations, including best picture.

positing that the first casualty of indoctrination is objective truth, waititi follows in the footsteps of filmmakers such as charlie chaplin (_the great dictator_), mel brooks (_the producers_), roberto benigni (_la vita è bella_), and even quentin tarantino (_inglorious basterds_), in attempting to defang nazi ideology by rendering it utterly absurd and mercilessly exposing it to mockery. marketed as an ""_anti-hate satire_"", the film has no easy task – to use nazism as the (mostly) humorous background to what is essentially a _bildungsroman_, without it seeming exploitative or dismissive of the real suffering endured by real people. and waititi manages this tricky balancing act exceptionally well. the satire and slapstick elements are as funny as anything in his filmography, and the film's more serious moments (of which there are several) arrive like an absolute gut-punch. this could have gone wrong in so many ways – if it wasn't funny, if the emotionality felt contrived, if the serious moments seemed manipulative, if the whole thing just came across as disrespectful and in bad taste – but waititi navigates these dangerous waters magnificently. _jojo rabbit_ is, in fact, that rarest of films – a comedy where the serious moments feel completely earned and a drama with something important to say where the comedy enhances the seriousness.

_großdeutsches reich_, 1945. the european war is all but over. germany's army has been pushed back to the homeland and allied forces are approaching from multiple directions. however, the propaganda machine continues to ensure that the populace are relatively unaware that _der führer_ is on the brink of total defeat. in the fictional town of falkenhem, ten-year-old jojo betzler (an astonishing debut by roman griffin davis) lives with his whimsical mother rosie (scarlett johansson doing probably the best work of her career). his father, he believes, is fighting on the italian front, whilst his older sister inge recently died of influenza. and, oh yeah, his imaginary best friend is none other than hitler himself (a ludicrously over the top waititi), or at least jojo's childlike conception of hitler. believing absolutely in his duty to the state, jojo and his actual flesh-and-blood friend yorki (a hilarious archie yates) attend a camp for the _deutsches jungvolk_ branch of the _hitlerjugend_. the camp is run by the cynical cpt. klenzendorf (a powerful performance by sam rockwell that was outrageously ignored by the academy), who was forced to leave the front line upon losing an eye. helping him manage the camp are his effeminate second-in-command finkel (alfie allen) and the completely insane fräulein rahm (rebel wilson), who claims to have given birth to eighteen blond-haired blue-eyed _übermenschen_ who are now fighting on the front. when jojo is told by some older boys that to prove he has what it takes to be a soldier, he has to kill a rabbit, he refuses to do so, earning the moniker jojo rabbit. however, determined to show his fellow students what he's made of, he barges into a _stielhandgranate_ exercise, tossing a grenade against a tree, which then explodes a few feet away from him, leaving him with a limp and a scarred face, and forcing him to return home in disgrace. as jojo recovers, rosie persuades klenzendorf, who was demoted after the incident, to give him some work, and so he's employed to distribute propaganda around town. life is dull but straightforward. that is until he learns his mother has been hiding a young jewish girl, elsa korr (a nuanced performance from thomasin mckenzie), in a crawlspace behind the wall of inge's room. however, as every german youth knows, jews are mind-reading demons who must be exterminated. so why would his mother be harbouring one, and, more importantly, what does jojo do now that he knows?

perhaps _jojo rabbit_'s most laudable component is how well waititi balances the disparate tones, which is a hell of a lot better than benigni did. the film mixes slapstick humour, caricature, satire, dramatic irony, and hope, but never does it seem like its ignoring or trivialising real suffering. when the comedy is dropped and waititi gets serious, the tonal shifts pack a shocking punch, and it's _because_ they're so well integrated into the overarching comic structure – if you take away the humour and the satirical edge, the film's darker elements simply don't work as well – it's the contrast that makes each element all the more powerful. waititi's tonal intentions are indicated right from the beginning, as stock footage of german children performing 'heil hitlers' is scored (unashamedly anachronistically) by the german version of the beatles' ""i want to hold your hand"" (1963). also crucially important to the film's tonal qualities are the bright, colourful palette employed by director of photography mihai mălaimare, jr. (_the master_; _a walk among the tombstones_; _the hate u give_) and the whimsical production design by waititi's regular designer, ra vincent. together, they speak to the fact that this is jojo's worldview rather than objective reality, with the look of the film reminding me a great deal of wes anderson's _the grand budapest hotel_ (2014). it sure doesn't look like any world war ii movie you're ever likely to have seen.

thematically, the film examines multiple issues; the devotion of motherhood, the importance of kindness in defeating indoctrination, the disconnect between an unchallenged and rigidly reinforced ideology and a far more nuanced and complex reality, the predetermined attitudinal stance towards the other, the clash between doing what one knows to be right and what one is expected to do, the fact that good people can be found even in the worst of circumstances. klenzendorf's arc is especially telling in this respect. introduced as a hyperbolic caricature, the source of some of the film's biggest early laughs, as things progress, we realise there's considerably more to his character than initially thought, and he commands what's easily the most moving scene in the whole film. this is jojo's story, however, with much of the runtime concerned with his attempts to rationalise the cognitive dissonance between what he's been taught and what he can see with his own eyes. rosie is rightly worried that the indoctrination jojo has known his entire life has effectively brainwashed him – he's so passionately loyal to nazi ideology, when he found out his grandfather didn't have blond hair, it took him three weeks to get over it.

of course, as mentioned, although set in 1945, _jojo rabbit_ is really about the here and now, although it's more than a little upsetting that its depiction of illogical hate is so timely. essentially, the film mocks extremism, people who hate based on ethnicity or religion, with jojo's belief that jews are demonic figures capable of powerful magic standing in for people who believe all muslims are terrorists or all mexicans are rapists. in this sense, the film isn't about nazis at all; their role is more allegorical. rather it's partly about the role adults play in inculcating children into hate and partly about exposing the power of propaganda to subvert truth. but so too is it about rising above such ideology, no matter how ingrained it might be, a path that values personal relationships with persecuted minorities, which in turn reveal the individualistic humanity behind the political cliché. and although all of this is presented humorously, it never becomes didactic or monolithically preachy – waititi balances his tones so well, the political undercurrent remains always subtle.

if i were to criticise any element of the film, it would be that waititi undeniably glosses over some of the more horrific atrocities carried out during the war. the nazis in the film are, by design, cartoonish, but that is done so as to render them as easily dismissed figures to be scorned. the reality, of course, was far, far darker. i've seen some critics point to this as evidence that the film is crass and manipulative, and although i disagree with that assessment, it certainly wouldn't have hurt to have at least one fully indoctrinated nazi who isn't a figure of fun – even the gestapo is exposed to ridicule, with the character of deertz (an admittedly hilarious stephen merchant cameo) presented as more concerned with empty pop-cultural signifiers than carrying out the actions of the real gestapo. in this sense, the film doesn't represent the awful truth, but it never claims to; this isn't a reality-based examination of nazism, nor does it try to be.

only two weeks into 2020, and i already have a possible film of the year. _jojo rabbit_ is beautiful, emotional, heartfelt, and devastating, but mostly hilarious and always hopeful. it's an extraordinarily sweet film without ever becoming saccharine, as waititi strikes a perfect balance between comedy, tragedy, and drama. it's a very funny world war ii film which imparts a vital message for our confused and divided world of today – if we let them, love will always trump hate, hope will always light a way through the darkness.",high

if they had dropped the budget and not taken it so seriously, it actually would have been a fun albeit ridiculous space adventure. it really had all the makings for campy science fiction fun. the potential was there.

but, instead, the film took itself too seriously... so seriously that kind of lost the fun element behind it. and it took itself seriously because of the political message attached to it, and unfortunately it's kind of directed towards the ""everything has to be political all the time"" crowd and they take everything so seriously that nothing can be fun.

but the potential was there. it wasn't dark enough to be sci-fi horror ala alien... and the plot lends itself to campy sci-fi adventure, or at least a sci-fi adventure... and even there politics are integral to the plot. science fiction is a satire of some element of culture, but it's done in a way that is entertaining.

had they toned it down a bit, had they not thought they were making chinatown, it would have been much better.

greta gerwig’s adaptation of louisa may alcott’s timeless novel, _little women_, feels like coming home. it’s the sort of movie that surrounds the audience with feelings of warmth and comfort. this feeling comes from the coziness of the cabin the march family resides in, the love that exudes from the performances, and the treatment of the source material, which was clearly a formative book for gerwig. she approaches this retelling with a few small updates and a great reverence for the original.",high

6288,"i'll admit i had some interest when i heard that a tolkien biopic was in the works, but now that i've actually seen it, i'm very unsure about who was supposed to want this movie? it's just an unbearably clichéd biopic that makes sure it ticks all the boxes a biopic for some reason must. i don't understand how this formula gets forced in to the real-life story of every person who has ever lived a time that was put to screenplay. it's so boring, and it's so **done**. who was crying out for a movie that examined famed author j. r. r. tolkien when he... went from mildly unpopular at fancy pants school, to mildly popular at fancy pants school? not when he was writing the most famous fantasy series of all time. not when he was at war (or at least not more than about a cumulative 6 minutes of flashforwards at war). not his relationship with c. s. lewis. not even about going to codebreaking school. nope, a young tolkien whose not very likeable and rather lofty for someone who supposedly comes from such a poor background. it does touch on some references to his future writing, adding a little bit of a fantastical element, but it's **so** afraid of this, its best element, that really only seems to imply that old mate jirt wouldn't have come up with a single idea for lord of the rings unless some sort of external stimulus for it fell in his lap. another biopic cliché.

6303,"‘godzilla ii: king of the monsters’ promises to build on the great work already laid out for this franchise, mixing popcorn fun and thrilling craft, but instead it relinquishes all of that to be a predictably dull and plodding bore. it doesn’t even manage to be a fun, brainless monster movie, assuming that a satisfying monster battle is all about being big and loud and doing nothing else. we waited five years for the follow-up to ‘godzilla’, which only makes this new film even more of a disappointment, and doesn't excuse the badly-written screenplay or the poorly-executed visual effects. with dougherty handing the reigns over to horror director adam wingard for 2020’s ‘godzilla vs kong’, here’s hoping the monsterverse finds its feet again.

6305,"if you enjoy reading my spoiler-free reviews, please follow my blog :)

as some of you might know, godzilla: king of the monsters is one of my most anticipated movies of 2019. not because i expected it to be a beautifully written, heartfelt story with fully-developed characters who i would immensely care about. i was incredibly excited because it’s freaking godzilla and from the few images that i had seen, it looked absolutely stunning. i didn’t need an oscar-worthy screenplay or amazing performances. i just wanted a decent and logical (this last word is important) narrative with reasonable characters, and tons of monsters fighting to the death against each other. so, my expectations were neither complex or as high as some other people might have.

unfortunately, i left the theater extremely disappointed. i can’t deny the impeccable vfx and the infinite amount of wallpaper-worthy images spread across the entire film. some scenes are filled with jaw-dropping cinematography, astonishingly gorgeous monsters, and the fights feel so real that the sound design alone takes you to the edge of your seat. however, when the two pillars of any movie (story and characters) are so far away from even remotely working, there are no technically perfect aspects that can save the film from a disaster. i wrote this exact last sentence a few weeks ago regarding game of thrones, and i will stand by it. i’m always the first guy to praise exceptional filmmaking skills, but if i have to choose between a technically seamless movie, and a film with a fantastic story and fully-developed characters, i have no doubts that the latter is the indisputably right choice.

ultimately, that’s the huge problem here. the screenplay is loaded with some of the laziest exposition scenes i’ve seen in the last few years. characters continuously have some sort of presentation to explain something in a completely unpredictable conversation randomly. generally, a movie like this always has some kind of cliche secondary characters who are either a nerdy scientist, a comic-relief guy, a duo of bantering personalities or a military general who always wants to attack something, even though everyone knows it’s not the most intelligent decision. king of the monsters has all of these types and more! more?! seriously, michael dougherty and zach shields overstuff the narrative with so many unnecessary, useless, stereotypical characters who stretch the overall runtime and extend the periods between the massive fights, turning them into minutes of complete boredom.

i yawned during a godzilla blockbuster. yawned. how sad is that?! i really enjoyed gareth edwards’ 2014’s godzilla. at the time, the most common complaint was that there wasn’t enough godzilla in it. most of the characters were well-written, despite that some could have been more fleshed out. king of the monsters is (kind of) the other way around: there are dozens of monsters and bone-crushing, titanic fights, but they literally forgot to write a captivating story with compelling characters. in the first installment, even though i also wanted more godzilla, when he actually shows up, i was so freaking excited! since i had to wait for the third act to watch the titans fight, the build-up that was generated and its payoff actually made the time spent with the human characters worthy.

this sequel was doomed from the moment the characters were written. there are a lot of fight sequences, and i wrote above that unnecessary characters extend the periods between these scenes. the dilemma is that those periods need to exist, making the whole thing look like a double-edged sword that the director is trying to avoid. on one hand, you can’t have an action set piece after another action set piece consecutively, otherwise, these will lose impact over time and become monotonous, so you need to spend time with the horribly-written human characters. on the other hand, you can’t have dumb characters with unclear motivations on-screen for long periods, otherwise, the audience will fall asleep of tediousness or get annoyed, so you have to insert a massive fight sequence again, hence making the audience gradually lose interest in those scenes.

king of the monsters continuously repeats this cycle of going from one situation to the other. no one wants to have back-to-back fights because they’ll lose the impactful energy, but no one wants to waste their precious time listening to exposition-heavy powerpoint presentations from characters no one is going to remember their name. i can’t even remember the main characters’ names, and i watched the movie yesterday! i can’t blame the cast, everyone gives good performances. millie bobby brown (madison russell) continues her path to become one of hollywood’s biggest stars (in less than 10 years, she’ll have an oscar in her hands, i guarantee you that). kyle chandler (mark russell) does more than what was expected of him with such a lousy script, and ken watanabe (dr. ishiro serizawa) is the only one who delivered a solid performance and had a suitable character (fruit of the previous film). vera farmiga (dr. emma russell) is connected to the worst character of the movie (atrociously irrational decisions made by emma), and everyone else is pretty much one of the vast cliche secondary characters.

they had five years to write a straightforward narrative with simple characters. no fan neither wanted or needed a brilliant, groundbreaking screenplay. dougherty and shields delivered one of the worst scripts of the year, one filled with exposition, cliche characters, and a runtime that turned out to be way too long for someone to tolerate all of the dreadful dialogue. i don’t know if it will clearly end up as one of the worst films of 2019, but it’s definitely one of the biggest letdowns. all in all, godzilla: king of the monsters didn’t meet my expectations (and mine were pretty fair), not even close. visually, it’s one of the most striking movies i’ve seen this year, and that can’t be dismissed. from the massive fights with the titans to the impressive wide shots, dougherty had a gorgeous diamond that he just needed to polish with a rational and simplistic story, like it was a soft, clean cloth. instead, he used a hammer…

advice - skip this film. it causes confusion by disrupting everything that came before it. it's like a reboot of the marvel universe ... or a parallel dimension. save your money for another movie.

....we have seen this before. the word ""rehashing"" has been thrown around a lot in some reviews, but really it's like a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy on a cheap circa early 80 copy machine. you've seen it before when it was a lot better.

the good news, i suppose, is that the trailers were honest, brie larson is honestly doing her best to imitate a block of wood and is just as animated and believable as a super hero.

and sam jackson, digitally younger, is still too old to do the required action scenes as evident by the enormous amount of cuts it takes to make it vaguely resemble actual action.

however, he still manages to outshine larson in the action department.

and, of course, nothing could improve it more than a killer soundtrack. unfortunately captain marvel only manages to produce a cringey soundtrack and i has always been a no doubt fan (at least until 2000'sreturn of saturn).

but the good news is they did reduce the transparent political posturing to a minimum (compared to what people had thought) but even then it is still far more than you'd get with better super hero moves *cough*wonder woman*cough*",low
6337,"hey, so, just some really quick thoughts i wanna get down, 'cause it's after 1 o'clock in the morning, and i wanna get some sleep so i can wake up well rested to see _endgame_ again.

putting it out there right from the get-go, _avengers: endgame_ is my favourite mcu movie. it's my favourite movie of the year too, but i've only seen like ten or so 2019 releases, and this is the 22nd marvel cinematic universe film, so that seems far and away the bigger deal. i can't say it's perfect, there's some conflicting stuff within its own runtime that really doesn't seem to gel (though a re-watch may prove me wrong on that), and it's not like every moment was the no-holds-barred-zero-exception best version of that moment from start to end. but god i loved this thing.

i will say this though, the reason that i loved it, is this thing is fan service galore. if you do not care for the franchise's 21 movies preceding this point, then _endgame_ is not the movie to turn you around on that. that may come in a future installment, but this one is a culmination. it's the end of _infinity war_ but also phase 3, but also a wrap-up and genuine ode to/send off for everything that marvel has done over the past 11 years. that to me was incredible, and i am eternally greatful, but i cannot imagine it working for people who have no vested interest in these characters.

to me though? my first 9 out of 10 rating in **three years**.

_final rating:★★★★½ - ridiculously strong appeal. i can’t stop thinking about it._",high
6338,"if you enjoy reading my spoiler-free reviews, please follow my blog :)

don't worry. this is going to be a pretty vague review. right now, as i'm writing this sentence, i'm still processing what i saw and how am i going to explain how i felt without spoiling a single tiny thing. first of all, it's such a mix of feelings. on one hand, i'm extremely happy that i was lucky to be alive during this epic time and that i was able to follow these characters that i love and care about so much. on the other hand, i'm obviously sad that it finally reached the end of this (hopefully) first incredible saga. there are no perfect films and one with so many heroes will always have struggles balancing it all (infinity war already had this issue). 

however, the russo brothers did everything they could to deliver a phenomenal story, and they did. i don't think this could have been any better. its last hour exceeds any expectations. it's epic, emotional, action-heavy, and it has one of my favorite shots in the entire history of cinema. it's pure magic, and the vfx team will surely get an oscar for it. the action reminded me of the biggest lord of the rings' battles, and it was impeccably filmed, filled with riveting and chill-inducing sequences. nevertheless, don't expect this high-intensity feeling throughout the whole runtime. the other two acts are a slow-burn build-up to a payoff that's going to make you pretty much either ""love"" or ""like"" this movie. i absolutely love it! 

this is easily one of the best mcu films, if not my new number one. i can't deny that the 3-hour runtime has some unnecessary scenes, but even if they don't have a significant impact on the plot or even in the characters, they still contribute to the enormous build-up. seeing this family that we grew up with just talking with each other or having lunch, at the same time that they deal with the consequences of thanos' snap, is inexplicably captivating and heartwarming. characters like natasha (scarlett johansson) and steve (chris evans) supporting each other is simply beautiful. their comradery and chemistry are worthy of some tears here and there.

some people didn't really enjoy infinity war so much due to the lack of screentime that some characters had. this time around, there are fewer characters to work with, so the balance is better. everyone gets an important role, from captain america to ant-man (paul rudd) to nebula (karen gillan), and even rocket (bradley cooper). every single character has a major moment. if you take one out of the movie, it just doesn't work anymore. this is not only great work from the directors, but also from the writers. 

christopher markus and stephen mcfeely are not even going to be remembered because fans will always think of the cast first. most of them will also remember the directors. but the writers?! if i stand at the door of the theater at the end of the film and question everyone about who are the writers, i strongly believe most of the audience won't know. every dialogue, every sentence, every word carries so much impact on the narrative. literally, i cried and got chills just by hearing two freaking words with the perfect timing in between. the amount of grief that the words of the ones who've lost everyone and everything carry is palpable and, for me, those are the most emotional moments of the movie: seeing how everyone is suffering from their own losses, not the deaths themselves.

the humor is mostly on-point, but it's still connected to my only real issue with the film, which is the second act's tone. from the moment the team decides what to do, we already know that this is a 1 in 14 million chance of success like dr. strange (benedict cumberbatch) said, so the stakes and pressure are massive! with this level of tension, i didn't expect such an “easygoing” and “funny” vibe throughout, except for one particular sequence. they do a great job once again of pairing up certain avengers together, but most of them go through these too comedic plot points for such a crucial and serious mission. fortunately, this act carries enough action and emotional drive to make this problem not that big of an issue.

visually, this is arguably the best-looking superhero film ever. from the mind-blowing visual effects to the gorgeous cinematography, everything is perfect. the costumes are gritty and muddy when our heroes are in a battle, their faces are all filled with blood, and i have no words to describe how jaw-dropping that last act is. i can't wait to change my desktop wallpaper once that shot is available. i dropped a single tear just by looking at it. no one talks, no one does anything. it's just an amazingly beautiful image. the score is epic as hell. so much that i'm listening to it right now as i'm writing this review, and i'm getting chills all over my body. 

i can't really write much more, to be honest. i will acknowledge the cast because they are brilliant. each and every single member delivers an outstanding performance, but if i had to choose the ones that both surprised me and had the most impact on me, they would be johansson's, evans', and robert downey jr's (tony stark / iron man). “new” characters like captain marvel (brie larson) blend seamlessly, and the payoff is unbelievably satisfying. in terms of predictability, it goes more or less as i expected, but it still carries a few surprises throughout. nothing is ever like we imagine or theorize about, so expect the unexpected, and don't judge a movie by if it fits your crazy, unrealistic theories that never crossed the producers and directors' minds in the first place!

all in all, i don't know what to do now. the only thing i'm sure of is that i want to see it again, as soon as possible. the last hour is f*cking insane. i couldn't fall asleep properly because i couldn't stop thinking about it. endgame surpasses all expectations. it's everything i wished for and so much more. i could easily spend a whole day at the movie theater and watch three sessions in a row. it's that good. one of the best comic-book films of all-time, without a single doubt. thank you to kevin feige and everyone who worked hard to bring the mcu to where it stands now. i can't even think of how are they going to produce something at the level of infinity saga. maybe they never will. maybe we'll have to wait another decade or two for something like this. until then, see you at the next endgame screening! enjoy! oh and #dontspoiltheendgame!

ps: it's not a perfect movie, i know. it doesn't exist one. yes, endgame has some issues regarding its pacing and tone, but i would be lying to myself if this isn't everything i dreamed of. i felt the same way with civil war, regarding the rating to give, and i ended up giving it an a after a first viewing. as soon as i watched the second time, i changed it to an a+. i don’t need to wait for that second viewing with endgame … and thank you to my audience for being incredibly respectful. no yelling, no crazy laughs, no stupid people doing stupid stuff. thank you so much for not ruining one of the best cinematic experiences of my life!

6341,"these kind of movies are among the few movies that i can be bothered to go to an actual theater to watch nowadays. for most movies i just wait until they come out on disk (preferably ultra hd blu-ray if it’s available) and watch them on my home theater rig. so this weekend me and the kids went to the theater to watch avengers: endgame.

i have to say that it was better, even much better, than i feared. i really feared that the sjw retards at marvel would take this opportunity to completely re-organize the marvel universe to their liking. like how they completely ruined both professor xavier and wolverine in that abysmal logan movie. luckily, this did not really happen. maybe the financial reality of their failing sjw comics and disney doing a bit of culling of the most extreme of the marvel retards, the ones who fail to understand that super hero movies are meant to entertain and not be their personal agenda channel, are starting to take effect.

it was actually a quite good movie with plenty of action, some humor and, of course, lots and lots of special effects. even the story made somewhat sense, at least in the context of a marvel movie, even though the writers resorted to time travel.

the movie starts of somewhat dark and grim but i guess that was to be suspected. it cheered up as it moved along and then ending … well to me at least it was mostly satisfactory.

i was not too thrilled about the “new” hulk although i warmed up to him a bit during the film. thor? the less that is said about him the better actually. the rest of the merry bunch was in pretty good shape and i am quite happy that we did not get to see to much of quill’s usual shenanigans. i really hate that character.

i was quite positively surprised at the huge and quite cool battle towards the end. i was thinking, or rather hoping,  that at some time they were just going to reverse thanos’ crap and that would be it but instead we get to watch another huge confrontation with pretty much everyone involved at the end. very cool action and fx indeed.

there were some silly plot holes of course. as always when writers resort to time travel. an obvious one would of course be that, when they knew they only had enough pym particles to complete one trip for each person why did they just not go back in time to get more the first thing they did? especially since they later did exactly that. also, captain marvel (in her new sjw hairdo) flies through a barrage of fire, smashes through thanos’ ship like it was nothing and then struggles to combat thanos himself? there were a bit of this silliness spread around but not too much for me to be bothered by it.

there were a few casualties of which i am saddened by two of them. i think at least one of them was unnecessary and probably agenda based. i also strongly disliked the rubbish with captain america at the end. he has never been one of my favorite characters so i do not really care much about him being around or not but that rubbish sob-scene where he hands over his shield to a “politically correct” person was really unnecessary. i guess it must have been put there to appease the marvel sjw retards.

anyway, my bottom line is that i was greatly entertained by this movie. it had all the good stuff, real super heroes, action, special effects and not too much of the crap that has been spewing out of marvel the last years.",high

<em>'avengers: endgame'</em> is all of what i expected/wanted and more. i got goosebumps twice throughout the (masterfully paced) 181 minute run time, i can't say many films have inflicted that on me! love the ending and the way the infinity saga story wraps up.

the action is ultra thrilling, the score is fantastic and the effects remain great. i will say i don't think they nail the screen time for all involved outstandingly - that's not a negative, at all, it's just the fact that <em>'captain america: civil war'</em> and <em>'avengers: infinity war'</em> did it to an incredibly higher degree previously.

i've only become properly aware of all of the mcu in the last two weeks or so, yet this still gave me a memorable experience seeing this main story crescendo like this - i imagine it would've been quite the journey 'live' from ten years or so prior to the release of this.

6402,"making a quality sequel can be tough, and even moreso when it’s a follow-up to a beloved modern classic. “frozen ii” has huge shoes to fill from the outset, and this second installment of the disney animated tale of two sisters is a mostly unsuccessful adventure. even the dazzling animation can’t make up for what’s lacking, including the absence of an instant hit song (nothing here even comes close to the brilliance of “let it go”), dry voice performances, and a mediocre story.

when ice queen elsa (idina menzel) begins hearing a strange voice calling her, she and sister anna (kristen bell), kristoff (jonathan groff), snowman olaf (josh gad) and reindeer sven set out on a perilous journey to discover why elsa was born with magical powers. it’s a surprisingly dark adventure that, despite beautiful set pieces, is generic. the plot is confusing yet somehow predictable, and everything is disney-fied and wrapped up with a nice little bow by the final credits.

most disappointing are the bland songs (by robert lopez and kristen anderson-lopez). there isn’t one number that stands out. it’s a particularly huge letdown after the timeless toe-tappers of “frozen.”

the movie feels like it’s made more for adults than kids, and there are some scary moments (like olaf wandering through a deep, dark forest and flashbacks to the death of anna and elsa’s parents) that may frighten a few children. the idea of an action-adventure animated film with two strong female leads is commendable, but the potential to be something special instead of merely adequate is frittered away.

while the magic doesn’t reach the highs of the first film, “frozen ii” is beautifully animated and visually impressive enough to recommend only to those who love animation as an art form. everyone else would be smart to skip it.",low

i honestly wasn't excited about this one, so my expectations were low.  i didn't realize it was stephen king, let alone a sequel to ""the shining"" until i watched it.  i'm also not a big fan of ""the shining"", but i haven't watched it since i learned to watch a movie critically.

after hearing about ""shining"" from everyone, i immediately got excited when i realize that was what this movie was all about.  i've been waiting for this movie since ""push"".  this movie is honestly what ""star wars: episode i"" should have been.  this is how you give an explanation of how super powers work on a large scale: you tell a story that examples it, ""do not say"", it is how movies are supposed to work.

this was wonderfully casted: ewan mcgregor, kyliegh curran, and rebecca ferguson are amazing.  there deliveries have weight to them, and it really makes the movie.

the production value is fantastic, they definitely didn't spare a cent to make this look as good or nostalgic as it needed to be.

there are aspects of the story i think we could have done without, mostly just for time purposes, and there are portions of the story that are just gratuitously graphic, and some of those two things overlap, but i'm not going to say that any of the movie would actually be better for it.  the story, whether it be the movie or from the book, is exceedingly well paced, and powerful, every step of the way.

it has this wonderful theme of predators and prey, basically ""there's always a bigger fish"", but in a twisted, looping way.

if you can stand horror at all and like psychic powers, then definitely give this a watch.",high

and, let's be honest, as good as stanley's film was, it really had little to do with kings novel. almost the shining in name only. so many changes were made, right down to the theme, that it barely resembled the book.

so, when they made the sequel to the movie, and not the novel, a lot of the elements that made the doctor sleep compelling, a lot of the plot points, and a lot of the twists and turns that made the novel worth reading had to be changed in order to keep continuity with kubrick's changes.

the result is really kind of a mess. so much of what doctor sleep was referenced back to the shining, the novel, that trying to adapt the script to the kubrick film was, honestly, a mistake.

in the end, it grasps at straws and never finds a footing, making doctor sleep even further removed from the story it was based on than kubrick's film was... with far less talent directing it.",low

6444,"theatrical plays or musicals will not always translate well into filmic language, that's well known and will not change, because both media are very different by nature. to question it is to deceive yourself.

personally i've never believed that cats is a great musical but perhaps its success says something else but even so a film adaptation in my view just could not work. i didn't see how, especially considering the costumes but it was being made so the question now was how it was going to look.

i know there's already a ''movie'' but that's basically a recording of the play.

then the trailers appeared and what they showed looked weird, off putting and scary, but the visual work is not always everything in a movie, yet something decisive was being played here.
eventually the defeat was inevitable.

cats is full of good intentions but it's a failure, not only because of terrible work in cgi and how it makes you feel but because it never manages to immerse you in the world of the story and is a bizarre world and i can have fun in bizarre worlds, it's only that this one is pretty misguided.

i don't think it's that huge fiasco that a lot of film critics are saying it is and maybe eventually will find its niche and audience, after all worse films have become cults films, so that can surely happen but right now cats is simply an idea that didn't work, that it wasn't well executed or directed and that although it's not a monumental catastrophe, it's indeed a gigantic disappointment.",low

but, for those among us that are normal, or at least not jumping onto that bandwagon, all i can say is...best ending ever!!!!

<em>'uncut gems'</em> is an absolutely thoroughly thrilling watch, the plot is so chaotic and high paced that it's practically impossible to not have a fun time with it. the cast do terrific work, typified by the tremendous adam sandler.

sandler (howard) is unquestionably the star of the film, he gets a lot of stick for a lot of the roles he usually plays but this is far from anything i've seen him portray. he still shows his funny side no doubt, but he adds much more to make it a memorable character - which is a rarity for him.

'a hidden life' is a remarkable and uncompromising film, a work of hope and sorrow and belief in the human spirit. even with the foundation of a true story, malick still continues to experiment, to follow his instincts and find a thematic journey more important than a narrative one. at nearly three hours, with almost no dialogue, a slow and considered pace and malick's propensity for aesthetic indulgence, it certainly won't be a film for everyone, but those able to tap into it will find a deep and profound experience. 'a hidden life' isn't terrence malick returning to form. it's another step in the evolution and exploration of one of the most singular filmmakers the cinema has ever seen.

legendary writer/director terrence malick originally studied philosophy and excelled as an undergraduate at harvard under philosopher of aesthetics, ethics, and ordinary language, stanley cavell. in 1966, malick wrote an exceptionally well-received thesis on edmund husserl, the founder of phenomenology (study of structures of consciousness), and martin heidegger, pioneer in the fields of hermeneutics (study of theories of interpretation) and existentialism (study of the totality of an individual's experience), and founder of existential phenomenology (more on that momentarily). malick graduated _summa cum laude_ and _phi beta kappa_ with a rhodes scholarship, and headed to oxford to work on his phd thesis under gilbert ryle, a behavourist best known for his opposition to the cartesian conception of mind-body duality (the theory that the mental and the physical are separate and do not affect one another). however, ryle felt that malick's proposed study of conceptions of ""being-in-the-world"" in the work søren kierkegaard, ludwig wittgenstein, and heidegger ""_wasn't philosophical enough_"", and malick returned to the us without his doctorate. in 1969, he published a translation of heidegger's 1929 essay ""vom wesen des grundes"" as _the essence of reasons_, before finding his way into filmmaking, where his knowledge of heidegger, particularly the concepts of existential phenomenology, would inform his filmography from its inception.

at the same time, malick's films have always tended to deal with explicitly christian themes, particularly the notion of grace (the free and unmerited favour of god). _badlands_ (1973) and _days of heaven_ (1978) are both moral parables about fallen men – in _badlands_, kit carruthers (martin sheen) accepts his evil and trades on society's fascination with that evil, whereas in _days of heaven_, bill (richard gere) attempts to outrun the wrong he has done, bringing biblical retribution down on himself and those around him. malick's masterpiece _the thin red line_ (1998) is partly about the contrast between war and the belief that this world is merely a gateway to the next, whilst also looking at the idea that the glory of god can be seen everywhere, no matter the circumstances, if one only has the eyes to see it. the criminally underrated _the new world_ (2005) looks at the clash between nature and grace, and the corruption of the values of the old world. nature versus grace also forms the spine of the palm d'or-winning odyssey that is _the tree of life_ (2011), but here, malick is more interested in looking at the similarities between the macro (the birth of the universe) and the micro (the death of a child), and how each is part of a tapestry none of us can fully comprehend. and then we have his unofficial modern-day trilogy, each made without a script – _to the wonder_ (2012), _knight of cups_ (2015), and _song to song_ (2017), punctuated by his pseudo-documentary _voyage of time_ (2016). _to the wonder_ continues to look at the contrast between nature and grace, albeit with a modern inflection. _knight of cups_ is essentially a modern version of john bunyan's christian allegory _the pilgrim's progress_ (1678) and looks at the dangers of coveting that which one hasn't earned or doesn't deserve. _song to song_ functions in a similar manner, transposing the story from the film business to the music industry. and _voyage of time_ is a homily to nothing less than the creator of the heavens and earth. and malick's next film? _the last planet_, a narrative covering a series of episodes from the life of jesus christ. yet for all this, malick is never didactic, dogmatic, or puritanical. no matter how lofty his vision, his films remain always rooted in the human soul, very much in the tradition of heidegger's existential phenomenology, which focuses on the ontology of the earthly _dasein_ (""being-there"") rather than the epistemology of the _lebenswelt_ (""lifeworld"") – even the most overtly metaphysical scenes in malick (the creation sequences in _tree of life_ and _voyage of time_) are still ultimately focused on earthly physical existence.

all of which brings us belatedly to _a hidden life_, which may be malick's most ostensibly christian work yet. although his most narratively conventional and linear film since thin red line, it's quintessentially malickian, featuring many of his most identifiable stylistic traits (whispered voice-overs, sweeping cameras spinning around non-stationary characters, the beauty of nature contrasted with the ugliness of humanity). in this sense, although critics who disliked the trilogy are hailing it as malick's ""_return to form_"", it's certainly not going to win him any new converts. malick's films are about the search for transcendence in a compromised and often evil world, and, telling the true story of the austrian conscientious objector franz jägerstätter, who refused to swear an oath of allegiance to hitler, _a hidden life_ is no different, asking questions such as should one do what one knows to be morally right, even when it accomplishes nothing except the suffering of one's self and family; what is the value of sacrifice if it goes unknown; how far can principals be invoked in such a situation; should spiritual purity be the supreme arbitrator of one's conscience; is one obliged to condemn evil even if that condemnation is irrelevant? pretty light stuff all round, really. winner of both the _prix françois chalais_ and the _prix du jury œcuménique at cannes_, the film was screened at the vatican film library in december 2019, with malick making an ultra-rare public appearance. and how good is _a hidden life_? very, very, very good. not quite _thin red line_/_tree of life_ good, but certainly _badlands_/_days of heaven_/_new world_ good. this is cinema at its most sublimely pious, a supremely talented master-_auteur_ operating at the height of his not inconsiderable powers.

austria, 1938. in the bucolic village of sankt radegund, nestled in the mountains and valleys of oberösterreich, peasant farmer franz jägerstätter (august diehl) lives a simple but blissful life with his wife fani (valerie pachner), his mother rosalia (karin neuhäuser), fani's sister resie (maria simon), and his and fani's three children – rösl (ida mutschlechner), maridl (maria weger), and loisl (aennie lade). a devout christian, franz is unenthusiastic about the looming war, despite its widespread popularity in the village, bringing him and his family into conflict with many of the locals, most notably mayor keil (martin wuttke), who considers franz a friend, but who is also in favour of the _anschluss_, believing austria to have been decimated by immigration. franz is called up to basic training and is away for several months, but when france surrenders in june 1940, it's thought that the war will soon end, and he's sent home without having been deployed. however, as time goes by, and as the war shows no signs of ending, his opposition grows ever more ingrained, to the point where his wife, mother, and sister-in-law are being harassed and his children teased. seeking the counsel of local priest and close family friend ferdinand fürthauer (tobias moretti), franz is referred to the bishop of salzburg, josephus fließer (the final performance of the great michael nyqvist), who tells him that the church teaches one must be faithful to one's fatherland. eventually, franz is conscripted, and the first order of business is to swear an oath of allegiance to hitler. franz, however, refuses, and is arrested and imprisoned. for the next few years, several people try to get him to change his stance, most notably captain herder (matthias schoenaerts) and lueben (the penultimate performance by the legendary bruno ganz), a sympathetic judge, both of whom try to convince him that his sacrifice will accomplish nothing except cause pain for his family. nevertheless, although he has no desire to martyr himself, he remains resolute.

needless to say, malick fashions this material into a thematically rich mosaic. to a certain extent, all his films deal, to one degree or another, with the notion of the corruption of eden. in _badlands_, it's the exploitation of childlike innocence; in _days of heaven_, it's the destruction of the bucolic texas panhandle by a biblical plague and fire; in _thin red line_ it's the peaceful and harmonious solomon islands, their culture fractured by a war about which they care little; in _new world_, it's the spirituality of the pre-colonial americas; in _tree of life_, malick returns to the corruption of innocence, but so too looks at the effects of cruelty on the human soul; even the present-day trilogy looks at notions of ruination and spiritual disintegration. however, _hidden life_ is perhaps his most explicit examination of this theme thus far. sankt radegund is introduced as an earthly paradise, hidden in the embrace of the nearby mountains, fed by the river en (the film was originally called simply _radegund_, before adopting the george elliot quote as its title). one of the first lines of dialogue is fani stating, ""_we lived above the clouds_"". life is simple and pure, with subsistence cultivated from nature by hand. however, as the war takes hold, the village comes under attack, not by bombs, but by ideological complicity and moral midgetry. the harmony and idealism have been corrupted, not by franz's refusal to comply, by everyone else's insistence on compliance. the village at the end of the film is an infinitely different place from that at the start, a tainted place. as much as this is franz's film, so too is it a story about the fall of eden.

although malick has never been an especially political filmmaker in a conventional sense, one could certainly read an element of political allegory in _hidden life_. this is a story of christians, often very devout christians, refusing to condemn an evil man when he rises to become the leader of their country (""_don't they know evil when they see it?_"") so too is it the story of the church's failure to stand against evil for fear of having its power curtailed. it also looks at how characters like keil are easily convinced by hitler's anti-immigration rhetoric, and touches on the idea that a man's integrity might be called into question because he dares to call out a leader for their transgressions. all of this has obvious contemporary parallels. for example, look at how us evangelicals have blindly embraced trump despite the antithetical nature of their (apparent) ideology and his actions. nowhere is this clearer than in the puritanical figure of vice president mike pence, a supposedly pious born-again christian who actively supports and excuses an immoral and corrupt regime. the ease with which hitler's empty nationalist bravado won supporters to his cause is not dissimilar to how trump marshalled his base during his 2016 presidential campaign, and how he keeps that base sweet with his ongoing racist diatribes. similarly, the idea that a man's integrity can be called into question for failing to offer blind loyalty to a corrupt leader finds parallels in the case of lt. col. alexander s. vindman, a purple heart recipient (won during his time with a military that trump repeatedly dodged), who had his integrity and patriotism questioned for daring to testify against trump during the 2019 impeachment hearings. similarly, at one point, franz is told, ""_a darker time is coming, and men will be more clever. they don't confront the truth. they just ignore it._"" malick may or may not have explicitly intended the contemporary resonance of such lines, but one can't deny their applicability to the here and now.

in any case, franz doesn't resist the nazis because he wants to spearhead a movement or because of political high-mindedness. his reasons are simpler – he believes that god teaches us to resist evil, and as a great evil, he must therefore resist nazism. there's nothing egotistical and precious little that's political in this stance. it's not even a question of personal morality. he believes he's acting in the way instructed by the almighty (""_they ask you to take an oath to the anti-christ_""). in an important exchange with lueben, franz is asked, ""_do you have a right to do this?_"", to which he responds, ""_do i have a right not to?_"" his resistance is ingrained in his very soul, it is part of his purpose in life. indeed, watching him head willingly toward his tragic fate, turning the other cheek to the prison guards who humiliate and torture him, he becomes something of a christ figure (""_does a man have a right to put himself to death for the truth?_""), with his time in prison not unlike the passion. an important conversation concerning this is when he is speaking to ohlendorf (johan leysen), a cynical artisan who is restoring the local church's artwork. ohlendorf laments that he must work not on images of christ's suffering as it was, but on the sanitised version desired by the clergy, and he lacks the courage to do otherwise; ""_i paint their comfortable christ, with a halo over his head. some day i might have the courage to venture. not yet. some day. i'll paint the true christ._"" it's a subtle summation of franz's situation, of course, but so too of the film, which shows franz's suffering as it was even as it celebrates the power of faith to transcend such suffering.

in this sense, much like pvt. witt (jim caviezel) in _thin red line_, franz is a heideggerian _sein-zum-tode_ (""being-towards-death""). this describes not the hastening towards the end of _dasein_ in a biological sense but is rather about the process of growing in the _lebenswelt_ to a point where one gains an authentic perspective on _dasein_, a perspective solidified by death, as one comes to completely accept the temporality of this existence, and hence no longer fear death. the application to both witt and franz is obvious – both men accept that this world is transitory and that life is simply part of the soul's eternal journey, so neither man fears death, and by not fearing it, they triumph over it. in _thin red line_, pvt. bell (ben chaplin), writes to his wife, ""_if i go first, i'll wait for you there, on the other side of the dark water_"". here, fani tells franz, ""_i'll see you there. in the mountains._"" the sentiment is the same – after this world comes another; after the transitory comes the eternal.

at the same time, however, the film never denies or ignores the pain of living, nor the corruption and decay found in the world. malick has franz point out such things as ""_he who created this world created evil_"", whilst fani naively believes ""_no evil can happen to good men_"", something explicitly addressed and denied by cpt. staros (elias koteas) in _thin red line_, who asks, ""_are you righteous? kind? does your confidence lie in this? are you loved by all? know that i was, too. do you imagine your sufferings will be less because you loved goodness? truth?_"" goodness and truth do not exempt one from suffering. the sun shines on all men alike, good and evil, and although fani hypothesises that ""_a time will come when we will know what this is for_"", malick seems to suggest that it will not be on this plane of existence. if there is sense to be found, as franz and witt believe there is, much of malick's work seems to suggest that that sense is to be found elsewhere.

aesthetically, as one expects from malick, _a hidden life_ is almost overwhelmingly beautiful. i have to admit, i was concerned when i found out this would be malick's first film without production design jack fisk, and even more concerned with i learned it would also be without cinematographer emmanuel lubezki, who has worked on all of malick's material since _new world_ (_voyage of time_ notwithstanding). instead, the film was shot by jörg widmer, a prolific steadicam operator and camera assistant who also started working with malick on _new world_. and the cinematography is very, very impressive, albeit not quite up to the quality of john toll's work on thin red line or lubezki's on tree of life. but what is?

as in everything malick has ever done, the power, vastness, and indifference of the natural world are paramount. indeed the film opens with the sounds of birds chirping and a river flowing, followed by a voice-over in which fani invokes the natural grandeur of sankt radegund (""_i thought that we could build our nest high-up. in the trees. fly away like birds to the mountains_""). all of this before we see a single image. the film then begins (and closes) on breath-taking shots of the mountains around the village. after the opening shots, malick surprised me by cutting to old archive footage of nazi marches and rallies. bizarrely, taika waititi chose to open his anti-hate film _jojo rabbit_ (2019) in similar fashion, although, as one can imagine, malick's film has a slightly (ever so slightly) different tone to waititi's brilliant satire. something else malick does that he has never done before is that a lot of the vo is epistolary, with large portions of it taken from the letters franz and fani write to one another when he was in prison. again, for malick, this is a very conventional style to employ, especially insofar as his vos have been getting more and more abstract as his film have gone on – in _badlands_, a lot of the vo is from a diary, whereas in _song to song_, the vo is so ethereal, it often doesn't even form full sentences. the vo in _hidden life_ is spoken entirely by franz and fani, and is far less abstract, which is not to say for one second that it's explanatory or expositionary, rather than it's more linear.

shooting digitally on the red epic dragon camera, malick and widmer shot most of the exteriors (and some of the interiors) in a wide-lens anamorphic format that distorts everything outside the dead-centre of the frame. the effect is subtle (we're not talking fisheye lens distortion), but important – pushing the mountains further around the village, bringing the sky closer, elongating the already vast fields. this is a land beyond time, a modern utopia that kisses the very sky. you look at this world and you think to yourself, ""_why would anyone not do everything in their power to stay here, or to return here if forced to leave?_"" we're seduced by the beauty. but franz sees something more beautiful. he can leave this place because he sees the glory beyond this life, the eternal beauty of faith in god. the more invested you are in the natural splendour and wonder of radegund, the more awed you are, the more franz's conviction will mean to you. such is malick's total control of the medium – theme and form impossible to divide. this, more than anything, is where the film's power lies, and how it moves beyond the sensory, becoming a homily to the transcendent power of faith. you don't watch _a hidden life_. you let it enter your soul.

as for problems, as a malick fanatic, i found very few. you know what you're getting with a malick film, so complaining about the length (it's just shy of three hours) or the pace is kind of pointless. you know if you like how malick paces his films, and if you found, for example, _new world_ boring beyond belief, so too will you find _hidden life_. one thing i will say, though, there are a few scenes in the last act that are a little repetitive, giving us information we already have or hitting emotional beats we've already hit. it could also be argued that the film abstracts or flat-out ignores the real horrors of world war ii, but that's by design. it isn't about those horrors, and _thin red line_ proves malick has no problem showing man's inhumanity to man. this film is not about the chaos and horror of combat. it's about the spiritual journey of an individual, and frankly, if malick has suddenly injected a combat scene into it, it would have completely disrupted and undermined the tone. the same is true for politics; much like sam mendes's great war movie, _1917_ (2019), _hidden life_ is not about politics, so to accuse it of failing to address politics is to imply it's obliged to address politics. which it most certainly is not; no work of art in any medium is obliged to address anything, no matter its theme or focus. i've also seen a few critics say that the film is vague on the reasons for franz's resistance. which is astounding to me; i don't understand how you can watch the film and come out saying ""_i don't get why he did that_"". the entire film is fundamentally about why he did it. it's in every frame, every piece of dialogue and vo.

_a hidden life_ left me profoundly moved, on a level that very, very few films have (_thin red line_ and _tree of life_ amongst them). less a film than a spiritual odyssey, if you're a malick fan, you should be enraptured. i don't know if i'd necessarily call it a masterpiece, but it's certainly close and is easily the best film of 2019 that i've seen thus far (the fact that it missed out on a single academy award nomination is a commentary unto itself). malick's film have always had something of a manichean viewpoint (the ""_darkness and light_"" of _thin red line_; the ""_way of nature and the way of grace_"" of _tree of life_), but _hidden life_ is probably the most rigidly manichean film he's ever done, with the eden of radegund contrasted with the evil of franz's imprisonment. however, even within this rigid divide, fani experiences cruelty in radegund, and franz experiences kindness in prison – the primal forces bleeding into one another's domains, with the film's thematic complexity never feeling forced for a second. _a hidden life_ is an exceptional piece of work in every way, and if you allow yourself to fold into it, the rewards are many.",high
6472,"terrence malick lovers are going to mesmerized by “a hidden life,” his latest, and perhaps even greatest, work in years. as a huge fan of the director’s films, this three hour ethereal work of art plays like an extended dream and is textbook malick perfection. but for those who find his films trying rather than celebrating his cinematic genius, this will likely prove to be yet another bore.

based on real events, this film is the story of a mostly unknown heroic austrian farmer, franz jägerstätter (august diehl), who refused to fight for the nazis during world war ii. this conscientious objector is ostracized by his village and eventually is threatened with execution for treason. franz eventually is thrown into jail, but he never falters with his brave stance. instead, he stands for what he feels is morally right, clinging to his faith and the love for his wife fanni (valerie pachner) and children to keep his spirit afloat.

admittedly, the film is much longer than it should be. there isn’t much more than 30 minutes of story, but it’s told with a philosophical beauty that eases the passage of time. that’s what makes the film an experience instead of a literal, traditional tale. jörg widmer’s cinematography is masterful with a lyrical, visual poetry. wide-angle shots of waving wheat fields and snow-capped peaks of the austrian alps shrouded in the clouds are jaw-dropping. the film is a collection of sensory visuals that will make viewers feel as if they’re right there, reaching out to touch the just-rained-on grass or struggling with the animals on the farm. i could smell the thunderstorm. i could feel the crisp mountain air.

malick is a complicated director who isn’t easy to endure much less like, but his storytelling is grandiose yet takes pause at the simplest aspects of life and survival. this is not a film for the impatient, as there is a lot of plowing, whispering, and slow-moving, indulgent visuals. it’s best to think of “a hidden life” as a meditation on morality, conviction, and existence, or a timely theme of spiritual struggles that arise from fighting for your beliefs and doing what you know is right.

perhaps this is what the devout refer to as a “religious experience.” i am not a spiritual person, but the beauty of this film moved me.",high

as a huge fan of the sci-fi genre, especially when it involves alien invasions of some kind, movies like this always leave me excited. it doesn’t matter what the audience or critics have been saying (in fact, it never does) because it won’t affect my enthusiasm (in fact, nothing does). by knowing who the cast, director, writers, and producers are, i instantly know how high or low i need to set my expectations. having this in mind, i was hoping that captive state could be one of 2019’s surprises. it has an unusual concept that can provide a very unique story if it’s well-told, so the big question is: did they execute all of their ideas successfully?

unfortunately, no. not even close. honestly, the screenplay is so convoluted and messy that i felt “lost” several times. i admire the amount of work that they put into this because they actually did and it shows. the overall concept and its ramifications are all there, the story is indeed interesting. it’s just the way that it’s told that ruins the entire thing. however, the first sentence i heard after the film’s conclusion, came from someone who said: “here i was expecting massive action and …” if you go into your movie theater expecting a straightforward, action-heavy, alien-invasion-type flick and you leave disappointed, that’s on you! from the trailers to its marketing, there was never a message of “hey, this is pure action, humans vs. aliens!” 

it tried its best to give the world a different take on this “sub-genre”, let’s call it that. i mean, they had it all: a good cast with the always astonishing john goodman (william mulligan) as one of the protagonists, beautiful visual effects that elevated the set design, and the aliens actually have an intriguing physical shape. sadly, there’s barely any aliens throughout the runtime. there’s hardly … anything. i don’t know what happened post-production, but it feels like they were pushed to deliver something different, so they cut all of the other scenes with extra-terrestrial stuff (i’m certain that they had more to show).

the main issue here is that you can never have a 100% ambiguous story. arrival is probably the best non-typical alien-invasion movie ever, not because it scarcely shows any aliens or action, but due to its twistful and thought-provoking script. nevertheless, it still shows a lot! you don’t leave that film disappointed because you didn’t see the inside of a spaceship or an actual alien. you leave perplexed and with your mind blown. captive state just leaves you confused and wishing for more. a lot more. there’s really not that much more to say on this review without getting into spoiler territory.

sadly, this is one of those movies that come out every year showing tremendous potential, an innovative and intriguing premise, but that in the end, it just isn’t able to succeed. it doesn’t structure its story and ideas in the most efficient way possible. its execution is sloppy, filled with hollow characters, no real flow (it feels like it’s just a scene after another scene), too vague, and it profoundly hopes that you didn’t figure out a pretty obvious twist so they can shock you seconds away from the end. it’s not horrible, but it’s definitely frustrating and disappointing.

john goodman delivers a great performance as always, and the visual effects are striking, to say the least. the production quality is undeniable, they really worked hard to provide the audience with an environment that actually feels real. the first act is pretty good, but it’s downhill from there. ashton sanders shares the lead with goodman, and he’s also pretty good, no doubt about it. however, and this sums up the film pretty well: if i have to check online what the name of the main character was (gabriel drummond), then something went terribly wrong. it’s not going to end up being one of the worst movies of the year, but so far, it’s the biggest letdown.

6493,"‘the lion king’ is a catastrophe; a new low in the ever-diminishing returns of disney’s endless run of remakes. there’s nothing redeeming about it, with every decision either ill-conceived or mishandled to the point of incompetence. in favreau’s hands, ‘the lion king’ is rendered thunderously dull, lacking in any tension or complex characterisation, taking a laboriously long time to go nowhere and never once justifying its contentious existence. even with my dislike of the original, i was flabbergasted at how thoroughly this film never attempts to understand why so many people love the 1994 film. if nothing else, this film makes it abundantly clear that disney has no interest in making great cinema or honouring its own legacy. they don’t care whether the film is good or whether you enjoy it. all they care about is using nostalgia to trick you into buying your ticket so they can make as much money off you as they can, and maybe if they throw some recognisable iconic moments from your childhood on the screen, they may even be able to fool you into thinking you’d had a good time. ‘the lion king’ is the ultimate diabolical apex of the commercialisation of nostalgia, and its inevitable box office success will just prove how easily we continue to be duped and how thoroughly they have trained us to not care about the quality of what we see. if this really is the future of mainstream cinema, then we are in serious, serious trouble.

6494,"if you enjoy reading my spoiler-free reviews, please follow my blog :)

i don’t know how i should start, but i guess i’ll address something that people might ask: yes, it’s a spoiler-free review. why? well, the story might follow the same essential plot points, and the characters might have similar narrative paths, but there are so many details that make this movie stand on its own. from tiny little improvements to moments of the original that wouldn’t make sense in a realistic environment to adjustments to character’s backstory, musical moments or other significant parts. with that said, i need to discuss the controversy surrounding this remake, but i won’t take longer than one paragraph.

people need to understand that these disney’s remakes aren’t here to replace the originals. they’re here to honor them, and bring their stories and characters to this new century so that new generations can have an additional look at something they love, and 90s kids can remember why they love these films so much. emphasis on the “additional” part of that sentence. then, people also need to get their preferences right: would you want to watch a shot-for-shot remake or something entirely different? or a blend of these two? if you don’t know what you want, you might be in danger of turning into a hypocrite if your speech goes from “i don’t want these copy-paste remakes” to “they changed that specific moment, why didn’t they keep it the same?” just be clear on what you wish. if you simply don’t want disney to do these remakes, then just don’t watch them. don’t go online try to beat it to the ground with negative comments if you haven’t seen the movie. moving on …

i love it. i absolutely love it. i cried the exact same 4 times as i did in the 1994’s original. my whole body got chills during the opening sequence, which is one of a few things i love more about the remake than in the original. it’s not a shot-for-shot remake! i don’t understand how so many critics are calling it so. either people’s memory of the original faded or someone clearly didn’t watch the same film. i can write a whole review of 1000+ words just describing the new stuff. of course, the story goes through the same iconic moments in the same way, and some dialogues are extensively repeated, which was something that i was hoping they developed more. despite that, i still feel that the scripts have a different take on it from the voice actors, even james earl jones.

one proof would be that i cried on a scene that i never felt like it in the original. i don’t know if it was how it was shot (one of the various different angles that the remake provides of known scenes) or if the dialogue just has more impact this time around, but the point here is that this remake is not a cheap copy-paste. i always look forward to seeing what they come up with to solve or adjust some questions that the originals leave us with. let me just write that jeff nathanson has some truly brilliant changes/additions. remember people criticizing scar’s look when the first teaser came out? with just one word, its entire physical shape, scar, and past are explained. one word. imagine that. there are little elements like adding a word or a sentence here and there, and it makes so much more sense with the character or the story in question.

speaking of scar, chiwetel ejiofor is astonishing. scar might be my favorite character of the remake. he’s more menacing and scarier, his voice is darker, and his arc is better explored. jeremy irons will always have that iconic voice associated with the character, but ejiofor did a crazily good job in replacing him. however, if there’s one voice that i could never watch another actor do is mufasa’s. i have no words to express how emotionally powerful james earl jones’ voice is. as soon as he says “simba” in the reflection scene, my eyes drop waterfalls. his voice is an emotional trigger, let’s call it that. i love timon (billy eichner) and pumbaa (seth rogen) even more this time around. their scenes are hilarious, and the characters’ relationship keeps being a standout. oh, and if you were worried that the hula scene would never be as good let alone surpassed … you might need to rethink that. also, i enjoyed the stretched last act (i found the original’s final battle too abrupt), and i would advise parents to be careful showing this remake to (very) young kids since the violence on display feels much more real (duh).

jd mccrary and shahadi wright-joseph (young nala) are amazing, and their voices are crystal clear while singing. donald glover and beyoncé (adult nala) are also terrific, and their voices are even better. the new music spirit fits better in this remake than speechless in aladdin. moving on to the music, it’s another aspect that i genuinely think the remake does better. hans zimmer proves that he can bring an old score of his back to life in a much more robust, epic, and passionate way. every song feels more prominent, every soundtrack feels a lot more impactful and stronger. be prepared is the only one that goes through a significant change, and while it might sound a bit strange at first, i love it more each time i listen to it. it’s a score that will never be forgotten, and this remake just helped people remember how great it is. oscar-winning score.

i left the best to last: the visuals. i can’t possibly describe how impressive and eyegasmic the cgi is. animals talking was never an issue (people keep sharing gifs or short clips and immediately started complaining that it looked awkward … a 30-seconds video without context watched on a laptop will never give you a hint of how the movie will actually be). yes, the expressiveness of the original animation can’t be achieved, but going as far as saying that the film lacks soul or that the characters don’t emote is just inaccurate. you don’t need a phd to understand that a lion with its ears down or up means different things. there are tiny little movements in the animals that are so complex that i’m still astounded how they were able to do it. if a bug flies near their faces, they flinch or move in such a characteristic way that i felt like i was truly watching real animals. once again, oscar-winning vfx.

i don’t really have major problems with it. minor gripes with a few things, but the biggest one would be the lack of more uniqueness. there’s no element of surprise in regards to the story or the character’s decisions. we always know what’s coming, so we’re prepared (no pun intended) for anything they through at us because, well, we’ve seen it before (with the exception of one particular scene that made me jump out of my chair and i think not a single person will be able to avoid it). i find the “animals don’t emote” argument one of the biggest nitpicks in the history of cinema. it might be true that they lack the emotion of the original animation, but going as far as saying that they show absolutely no emotion is just hating for the sake of hate. same goes for people criticizing the fact that can you feel the love tonight is sung during broad daylight … in the original, it isn’t nighttime as well.

finally, i just want to address the “these remakes aren’t necessary / no one asked for these” discussion. no one asked for the 1994’s movie until it came out. people didn’t know they needed it. seriously, everyone needs to realize that these remakes aren’t here to replace the originals. how many of you have watched the lion king (1994) or showed it to someone in the past 10 years? how many times have you heard its score in the same period? i bet that most of the answers are simply “none”. that’s how important this remake is then! it makes you go back, it makes everyone remember how incredible the 1994’s film is, by keeping its essence while being able to stand on its own. jon favreau did a tremendous job, and i hope he gets recognized for it.

in the end, it doesn’t matter if the story is identical if we cry all the same. it doesn’t matter if we know what’s coming if we still feel nervous and worried about the characters. the lion king (2019) is one of disney’s best remakes so far, on par with the jungle book. its vfx are game-changing, its score is more powerful and emotional than in the original, and the story carries the same heartfelt impact. james earl jones’ voice is everything. timon and pumbaa are even funnier. ejiofor’s scar is the best character in this remake. i have no flaws to point out, except that it follows the exact same path that the original’s story does. i wish it would be more distinct, but i can’t lie to myself, i love it deeply. one of 2019’s best movies. my #1 spot will be hard to decide… go watch it! i can’t wait to see it again!

disappointing and inconsistent.  2019 seems to be the year where the big movies were made to look good, but are in reality vapid and this is no exception.  
this looks good mostly (except when simba is a ""teenager"" and a lack of genitals means that the animals do not look really real), but everything else is below average.  also, the ""real-ness"" of the animals make some scenes way more scary for children.

the choices made in this are....strange.  
-the voice casting is weird (some african sounding, some american, and others in between) - like there was no plan.  
-extra scenes and dialogue do not add to the movie and even lessen it when compared to its predecessor.

6506,"the aeronauts is a100-minute long illustration of the rule in ebert's little movie glossary that teaches us, ""no good movie has ever featured a hot-air balloon,"" though it takes it less than 10 minutes to show why — right about the point where a poor, defenseless dog is parachuted from a hot-air balloon; the animal makes a safe landing, which of course raises the question, how does a dog, lacking both the brainpower and opposable thumbs, successfully operates a parachute?

this film actually illustrates something else, and it’s that 'sex sells' has been replaced by 'gender sells.' the most significant balloon flight depicted here is based on the september 5, 1862 flight of british balloonists james glaisher and henry coxwell. 

however, while glaisher appears in the film (played by eddie redmayne, who looks like he landed on his face after his own parachute failed to open), coxwell has been replaced by amelia (felicity jones), a purely fictional character.

the lesson seems to be that it's not enough to discredit a real person simply because they belong to the male persuasion, but on top of that they have to 'empower' a unnecessary character that the filmmakers have dreamed up because they can't be bothered to research the subject their film is supposed to be about — if they had, they would know that the history of aeronautics is not short on women; for example, katharina paulus, who invented the first collapsible parachute (and didn’t endangered a dog’s life in the process, i’m sure).",low
6507,"well, i like jones and i like redmayne so i had high hopes for this, plus it was based on true events... and i understood that it was going to be exaggerated for dramatic effect, but i didn't think it was going to be a total rewrite of history.

i don't mind taking artistic licenses when making movies based on historical events... but i had no idea that henry coxwell was a woman named amelia rennes and i didn't know that she was the only one capable of doing anything of value on the flight.

but, i guess politics got in the way of history, and they decided that a total rewrite to the point where it was based around a fictional character needed to be done because the truth had too much meh patriarchy? because they couldn't depict men as being intelligent or daring in any way?

they went woke, and filled it with trope of the new woke fad.

so, jones doesn't really struggle, she never makes a mistake, she is always more intelligent, stronger, and braver than anyone else around her, while everyone else around her is a bumbling fool that only succeeds because of her capabilities.

and, of course, her character is entirely fictional.

john wick 3 outstays its welcome and becomes tedious with all the boring twists and uninspired resolutions.

you'll watch it once, forget it ever existed and then never watch it again.",low
6514,"let’s make one thing perfectly clear. this is a movie you watch for the action and not much less. but then, that not really a surprise is it?

the movie takes off literally minutes after the last one ended. john wick is on the run and that’s the story for most of the movie. well, not entirely. he does have a plan but first he has to escape the many assassins trying to cash in the 14 million dollar bounty on his head.

this movie is all about action. the movie is r-rated although i honestly do not understand why. sure there’s lot of action and a lot of killing but still, i wouldn’t say it merits an r-rating and apparently the french ratings organisation didn’t either since here in france it france it got a 12+ rating. that is, it is only restricted for those younger than 12 years.

anyway, as i wrote above, this movie is all about keanu reeves and action. lots and lots of action which usually ends up in one or more persons getting killed by john or some of his remaining friends.

is the story and the action realistic? hell no! but it is fun to watch even though most of the bad guys shoots as accurately as imperial storm troopers. most of the time at least.

towards the end i did think it got a bit silly. the fight against zero and his last two students was pretty rubbish. it was kind of kick, hack and slash for a few minutes and then stand of and wait until the other guy got up again. then rinse and repeat. silly indeed.

also, they could really tone down on the ludicrous survivability of john wick. i mean, come on! he gets hit by cars and walks away. not to mention the final scene were he falls something like six seven floors, bounces (and i mean bounces!) off a fire escape and a trash container and apparently survives.

i probably should rate the movie a star less for that kind of stuff but i wont. this is something as refreshing as a hollywood movie apparently meant to entertain and nothing else. there’s really no political or social preaching or any other such nonsense which is really rare today. that alone gives it a few extra stars in my book.

the movie has a 7.7 rating on imdb at the time of writing this which is well deserved, even a bit low. even the rubbish sjw site rotten tomatoes claims the movie is “fresh” which is surprising given what i wrote above.

of course there is a whole bunch of “reviews” that claims it is so bad and so on and so forth. some of these reviews are actually repeated several times. that really pisses me off since these people seem to write reviews just to complain. it’s the third movie in the franchise for christ sake! you knew what you were getting yourself into. don’t watch the movie if you do not like these kind of movies. claiming there is no story is bullshit since the first one didn’t really have much more story but then the concept was bit more new of course. some “reviewer” claimed it was the worst movie he had ever seen. he cannot have seen many movies then. what a load och bollocks!

bottom line, this was two hours of great entertainment.",high
6516,"part of me wants to pretend that i couldn't find the paper thin plot of the film and rag on it for a complete and total lack of story... but i could follow what little of a plot there was so that would be kind of disingenuous.

not only that, but it would also be pretending that i didn't know what kind of movie this was when i sat down with my wife to watch it. and, honestly, i can't stand the reviews that take a john wick film and pretend that they expected something like chinatown walking in.

you know the ones i'm talking about, those reviews that lament the fact that they got a brainless action movie when they sat down to watch a brainless action movie.

if i said ""i'm not that deep"" i'd be giving them too much credit. so rather than saying that, i'm going to say that, when i sat down to watch it, i didn't lie to myself and pretend it was going to be anything more than a john wick film.

what you have is sleek, beautifully choreographed action brought to you in the most brutal of ways and delivered in a form that requires you to suspend your disbelief because it is just the right amount of totally unrealistic.

does it have a plot? yeah, but not really. it has just enough of a plot to make a loose story and not so much that it would get in the way of what was promised to be carnage candy.

and, honestly, carnage candy is the promise that the john wick people gave us and nothing more... and each installment of the franchise delivers on that promise. it never, ever, claims that it is anything more than an action film, and it never, ever pretends to be anything deeper.

it isn't a great film. it never claims to be. but it is a great action film, so you have to take it for what it is.",high
6517,"john wick: chapter 3 - parabellum picks up right where the sequel left off, with wick being excommunicated from the assassin underworld. the bounty is set at $14 million and wick has an hour to escape the city before his former associates come to collect.

while the plot might not be as strong as the sequel, it continues the same story points seamlessly. this film feels more like a continuation of larger narrative spanning across franchise, rather than separate semi-connected story like the first two. this film is bigger than the last, with vast and diverse landscapes for wick to create havoc in. the lore of world is expanded showing us more of the assassin leadership and how the chain of command works. all of the new additional characters worked well and were integrated into the story perfectly.

the action is picked up a notch, creating some of the craziest sequences i have ever seen on the screen. the fight inside of the knife shop was insane, it left me with my mouth literally dropping to the floor. it is one of my favorite action sequences in any film. one thing i particularly liked is the sense of desperation and isolation that surrounds our main character. we see john wick tested to the extremes, pushing the boundaries resulting in creative stunts and tactics to fight off multiple assassins at a time. it was really fantastic. the cinematography was incredible here as well. this film shows that with good choreography and a wide shot, you can create gripping scenes that do not require fifteen different jump cuts. the motorcycle chase has got to be one of the most breathtaking and seamless action sequences i have ever seen.

the acting quality sees a significant increase in quality when compared to the first two entries. keanu reeves is still keanu reeves, delivering a fairly cheesy and awkward performance, but that is what you come to expect and cherish about this franchise. the addition of halle berry and asia dillon were fantastic as the both added some serious dramatic acting beats that raised the quality of the film immensely. berry and wick had some great chemistry together.

overall, this film is excellent and if each entry can build upon the last like history has shown, the sky is the limit for this franchise.

'dark fate' was meh. i mean it's basically the force awakens of the franchise just more cash grab. like...how many times can they keep alternating t1 & t2, and yet it's astounding that it never ruins the legacy of the series. 

despite all that, it's the third best in the series. at least this movie knows that terminator is not for kids! i had some engagement in the movie, even through the reason being that it follows a familiar plot line.

linda hamilton and arnold schwarzenegger are both the stand outs. hamilton playing a cranky bad-ass and arnold playing an involved machine that has a life of his own. mackenzie davis was surprisingly not as annoying as i thought she will be just from the marketing alone. her character was straight forward in terms of motivation and can take damage.

tim miller really knows how to direct action scenes effectively and in this movie he delivers some grand action set pieces. however, after seeing the movie a few days ago, only a small selection stick to memory.

gabriel luna did a decent job playing the new advance terminator. they took the ""robert patrick"" approach with picking an ordinary looking guy and making him into the biggest threat of humanity. although it was a bit hard for me to feel threaten by him as throughout the movie he seemed easily out match by pretty much everyone. 

i didn't really buy into dani played by natalia reyes as the main ""saviour of the future"", mainly because of her stiff acting and everytime she holds a gun it's twice her size.

the visual effects at times looked pretty ok, but the rest looked really bad. it really doesn't help when there's close ups on the effects where you can see the fakeness. at times the movie was a little too dark and i don't mean in tone, just whenever it's night time.

6566,"if you enjoy reading my spoiler-free reviews, please follow my blog :)

i will always respect and appreciate the will of a director/writer in trying to do something bold and bonkers. whether that’s a divisive plot twist, a double-faced character or even an unusual method of filming, it doesn’t really matter, as long as it succeeds. steven knight delivers a story that doesn’t feel right from the get-go. everything feels strange and random, with weird dialogues and awkward hints at something underneath it all. then, a somewhat predictable plot twist changes pretty much everything since our perspective is entirely different now. however, it sinks the movie even more and creates a whole bunch of incongruencies and plot holes.

the film wasn’t near good before the twist, and it gradually transformed itself into something jaw-droppingly bad, after it. in addition to this, the final message that steven knight leaves the audience with, is probably one of the worst ones since the emoji movie. “doing the wrong things for the right reasons” is always going to be a controversial statement, but in this particular case, having in mind what happens in the movie and who does it involve, it’s 100% wrong and i want to believe that knight didn’t exactly want to transmit this in the way that he did.

there’s an intriguing and meaningful story to be told deep down in this messy screenplay. behind all of the unnecessary exposition scenes (there’s no need to describe what’s happening since the twist is quite self-explanatory) and cringe-worthy dialogues, there’s a well-structured narrative and an extraordinary concept to be explored. however, i have no idea what happened to the script nor the production and filming stages of the film, but i understand now why its original release date in october was postponed to the traditional january’s garbage. this was supposed to be an oscar-bait movie: an oscar-nominated director/writer plus two oscar-winner protagonists, in a film that seems to be more than what it actually is?  i guess the production companies saw this coming and they tried to prevent an even bigger flop. 

i’m always the first to defend that a movie without at least “good” technical attributes is rarely one of the best of the year. however, i’m also the first to affirm that if a film fails to deliver a captivating story with compelling characters, there’s no magnificent cinematography or mind-blowing special effects that can salvage it. serenity doesn’t even have that. despite me feeling pleased that it was filmed in one-location and that the set design is pretty sweet, the editing is incredibly choppy. it feels like knight had to remove several cuts in order to reduce the overlong runtime, which wasn’t performed in the best way possible. there are a lot of moments where a character is facing a side, and in the next cut, the former is already facing a completely different one (this particular thing really occurs often).

regarding the characters, baker and his son are definitely the ones that we learn more about since their connection is continuously addressed. like i wrote above, there’s a relevant story behind all of this mayhem, but i did saw (even if briefly) the light at the end of this very dark tunnel. that light is instantly consumed by the darkness as new characters or subplots start to show up, and the hollowness prevails over everything else. jeremy strong’s character is baffling ridiculous, diane lane (constance) is one of the dozens of logical reasons why the twist doesn’t work, but the one who annoyed me the most didn’t even show up. you spend a whole movie talking about this one person, like it is going to be a crucial subplot, and then you forget about it. you merely end the film, and it’s like that character was never even mentioned… why? why give even more reasons for someone to leave the theater frustrated?

then, there’s the tone. it’s weird until the twist and weirder after it. not even matthew mcconaughey or anne hathaway can save themselves from some awfully delivered lines. nevertheless, it’s the cast who saves this wreckage of being an f. mcconaughey is a hell of an actor and he demonstrates his outstanding range throughout the runtime. hathaway has less to do, and i felt that her lines were the worst, but i can’t argue with her ability to deliver any emotion. jason clarke (frank zariakas) is perfect as the violent father/husband, and djimon hounsou (duke) has some space to shine.

in the end, serenity tries to go big and bold, but falls astonishingly flat. plot holes, logical incongruencies, awful dialogues, terrible editing, hollow characters, and neglected subplots. steven knight had a great concept and a truly interesting thriller-mystery in his mind, but his execution is shockingly baffling, and the twist transforms everything into something way worse. the final message is the number one reason why i don’t recommend anyone to see this movie, especially if you take teens or kids with you. matthew mcconaughey is good enough to avoid a total disaster, and i know that there was something incredible behind all of this horrible mess. it’s probably going to end up as one of the worst films of 2019, unless we have a truly disastrous year in cinema.

i mean that was pretty bad. this is worse.

this is ultra woke politically correct kinda ghostbusters 2016, they have a message about genderstudies that trumps the story and didn't you know that everyone of a certain race, gender, and sexuality is absolute evil even if they have a long history of being the good guy sort of plot.

6589,"the working class and down on their luck kim family struggle to make ends meet. when a friend of the son, ki-woo’s, who is an english tutor for the daughter in the wealthy park family, has to leave his position, he recommends ki-woo for the job. now having an ""in"" with the wealthy family, the kims begin plotting the downfall of the current household servants and inserting themselves into those vacant positions, making them all gainfully employed and with money finally flowing into the household. but not everything is as it seems in the park house or with their previous servants.

this movie starts out as a comedy and quickly goes into social commentary, pointing out the differences between the poor working class family and the wealthy privileged family. the differences are ones that get commonly pointed out with the well-to-do having what usually gets termed as first-world-problems, while the poor family is literally trying to survive and save meager possessions in a flood. it doesn’t shy away or try to be subtle about it, but interestingly enough, we don’t feel beaten over the head with it either, which is a major change from the ham-fisted approach taken by most filmmakers. couching this in a comedy is a good approach, as well, as the audience’s guard is let down and we become more receptive to the ideas.

however, i do say it’s mostly a comedy. the third act takes a dark, dark turn, and the contrast, not to mention general disdain and even indifference, between the classes becomes much more severe. this gets into some hard territory, and characters that we’ve found quirky and even come to like in some ways show very different sides of themselves. at the same time, it doesn’t feel unexpected, almost like we could tell that this was under the surface all the time and tried to ignore it, but aren’t surprised by it when it does show up. this is some masterful characterization!

another aspect of note is that this film is rich in allegory and metaphor. it’s a smart film, yet at the same time the filmmakers are not condescending about it. they give the audience credit for being able to understand the symbolism and don’t spoon feed you everything, which is a refreshing change from the usual head-beating most filmmakers go for. at the same time, they understand that not every audience member will understand or immediately pick up on every symbol, but they have crafted this so carefully and so perfectly that you don’t have to understand each and every one. that understanding merely enriches the experience, but isn’t essential to it.

this film has gotten some recognition, and deservedly so. it is rich, intelligent, and polished to a degree that we sadly don’t see as often as we should nowadays, showing the filmmakers are masters of their craft. this is easily one of the best films i’ve seen in 2019. highly recommended!",high

news that adam mccay is collaborating with bong joon ho to retool parasite as a netflix series makes me positively giddy. parasite is easily the best movie i've seen since the big short. joon ho's compelling ease of execution alongside the effortless lure of the plot's trappings had me hooked in an instant. i would have been happy watching this family fold pizza boxes for two hours. the story, like the family, takes on a life of its own, rapidly elevating to a setup impossible to sustain. the bunuelesque occupy-the-rich scheme gleefully, blissfully ascends to lofty heights only, inevitably, to hit the fatal fan. the poor buggers ultimately find themselves literally chin deep in their own sh*t. the hotsy-totsy aristocrats, meanwhile, host a lovely garden party that flips into a tragic shakespearean bloodbath. it's all fun and games till someone loses a daughter. (note to the rich: check the references of new hires and think twice before inviting riffraff to your afternoon functions). decades in the making, the implosion of a middle income buffer and a widening disparity between social classes make parasite a must-see for all income brackets. you don't have to be rich or detest or envy the rich to enjoy this instant classic. but please, whatever you do, don't try this a home, folks. never combine the rich and poor without safety goggles or outside the confines of a controlled and supervised laboratory setting.",high

'parasite' is absolutely fantastic. i'm still buzzing how good this movie is. unpredictable and nuts. you know, this summer i was starting to get a little worn out with the endless sequels, remakes and soulless crash grabs, so i find it refreshing we get movies like this once awhile.

i admire bong joon-ho as a director, especially his korean movies. not to say i dislike his english language films like 'snowpiercer' and 'okja', but in my personal opinion those don't match the same quality as his korean movies and there isn't a sex pest trying to control his work. anywhere, bong joon-ho is one of the best working directors alive and 'parasite' proves it.

the movie perfectly blends drama and comedy so effortlessly, it basically breaks the impossible. and the comedy is actually hilarious and well written with the execution being sold on the actors. the thing i love so much is how funny, thrilling and intense the movie can be, hijacking all senses and emotions all wrapped into one - only a few directors can pull something this unique.

the performances from everyone was brilliant and there's so much depth to each character, they make the movie as captivating as it is. the cinematography was beautiful, the music was remarkable, and the movie says so much it's the reason why i was engaged throughout.

i highly recommend people to avoid knowing anything before going in, because trust me it will add to your experience.

yes, i know. i'm late as hell. i don't really have anything to offer you besides my personal opinion. theses and video essays are breaking down parasite at such a deep level that i can't really write anything new. nevertheless, i'll share my thoughts on it because it would be a massive miss from someone who considers himself as a film critic. i had this movie on my watchlist since last summer, but i kept delaying it, underestimating my time. so, no, i'm not just watching parasite because it won best picture at the oscars, i always planned on it.

in addition to that, yes, i also love it like most people, and no, i'm not writing this because i'm ""following the pack"". bong joon ho simply delivered one of 2019's best films, and it's definitely cracking a spot in my top10. i really enjoyed what bong did with okja, and i'm a massive fan of snowpiercer. therefore, this isn't just another south korean flick. it's directed and co-written by someone who has been proving himself for quite some time. even though i still defend that sam mendes deserved to win best director for his work on 1917, i'm more than happy that a foreign movie finally won best picture, and what a film to do it!

it can be described as a dark dramedy, but i think social satire is more adequate. the differences between the rich and the poor are beautifully shown on-screen exclusively through visuals. there's so little exposition, which is one of the reasons why parasite has one of 2019's best screenplays. the balance between explaining something and leaving it ambiguous is perfect. throughout the runtime, bong joon ho leans on an actor's face so that the audience can understand what that character is feeling through its expressions, which will explain its actions later on.

there's a sequence that surely has been heavily discussed for the past months. it's raining, and bong cleverly divides the screen with how the wealthy family is dealing with it against the poor neighborhood where the kim family comes from. the gorgeous cinematography, the unforgettable musical score, the seamless editing... everything about this sequence is technically flawless, and it carries such an emotionally powerful message. something astonishing and beautiful to look at for some can be a horrible disaster for others.

it's a movie that balances a lot of tones. in ten minutes, the tone goes from funny to dramatic to suspenseful to scary to absolute tragedy... and it all feels incredibly realistic. that's one of my major compliments to parasite: i never felt like it was fiction. i never thought ""this is too much, this would never occur"". even in the third act, where the narrative takes some bold decisions, everything makes sense with what had been shown until then. from shocking character actions to surprising plot points, bong and han jin-won's screenplay is excellent.

everyone in the cast is fantastic, but song kang-ho is the standout, in my opinion. his role as the father of the kim family is brilliant. i'm actually surprised he wasn't nominated for best actor in more award shows. i created a connection with this family in such a way that the ending truly impacted me. it's tough to deny that the writing is what makes parasite the phenomenon that so many people fell in love with, myself included.

technically, i don't have any defects to point out. it's one of those films that i firmly believe in having virtually no flaws. i'm in love with the score, i gasped several times at the impressive cinematography, and the editing is perfect. whatever genre the story decides to go to, it's always entertaining and extremely captivating. its comedy is very smart, and it made me laugh a lot of times. its dramatic storylines kept my eyes always focused on what was happening. even when it briefly delves into the horror territory, it's more suspenseful and scary than most of that genre's flicks nowadays.

all in all, parasite genuinely surprised me. with so many people hyping it to a ridiculously high level, my expectations were very moderate. nevertheless, i love it as much or more as everyone else. i know that watching it this late can make some people question my opinion/rating, but i would never love a movie because i ""should"" or because other people do. it deserves every award it received, especially the ones concerning the screenplay. it's one of the best original stories of the last few years, and it's written in such a brilliant manner, with beautiful visual storytelling instead of the overused exposition. an emotionally resonant message is present throughout the whole runtime, and the various tones are balanced seamlessly. technically flawless: cinematography, score, editing... everything's absolutely perfect. nothing is placed without purpose. not a single line of dialogue is wasted. bong joon ho is a phenomenal filmmaker, one that cares about the art and everything that comes with it. he truly put his heart and soul into this, and it would be a shame if anyone fails to watch this magnificent movie just because it's in a foreign language. please, don't make such an awful mistake...

>_we fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots. your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service – two dishes, but to one table._

- william shakespeare; _the tragicall historie of hamlet prince of denmarke_, 4.iii.23-24 (1599-1601)

what is one to make of the utterly uncategorisable and impossible-to-define _gisaengchung_ [_parasite_]? only the third film to win both the palme d'or and the academy award for best picture, after billy wilder's _the lost weekend_ (1945) and delbert mann's _marty_ (1955), _parasite_ is one of the best-reviewed films of the century thus far and caused huge waves when it became the first non-english language film to win best picture. co-writer and director bong joon-ho also tied with walt disney for the most oscars awarded to one person in one night – four (best picture, best foreign language film, best director, and best original screenplay). on top of that, he became the first person in history to win more than three oscars for a single film. in short, parasite has had a significant, and relatively unexpected, impact.

but what exactly is _parasite_? described on its official website as a ""_pitch-black modern fairy-tale_"", even a comprehensive plot summary wouldn't adequately delineate its real nature – part comedy of manners, part social satire, part heist film, part thriller, part horror, part family drama, part farce, part economic treatise, part social realism, part tragedy, part allegory. and that's just the opening scene! it's the _ulysses_ of cinema, adopting and shedding genres so often and so seamlessly that it effectively becomes its own genre. and, like _ulysses_, it's exceptional in just about every way – screenplay (co-written by bong and han jin-won), directing, cinematography, _mise en scène_, editing, production design, sound design, score, acting. there's not a weak link here, in a film that achieves that rarest of things – it lives up to the hype.

the kim family are down on their luck. father ki-taek (song kang-ho), mother chung-sook (chang hyae-jin), daughter ki-jeong (park so-dam), and son ki-woo (choi woo-shik) reside in a tiny basement apartment, with their only window looking out onto a popular urination spot in a back alley. with all four unemployed, they eke out a meagre living folding pizza boxes for a nearby restaurant. however, their fortunes change when ki-woo meets min-hyuk (park seo-joon), a childhood friend who is now at university. min-hyuk works as an english tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family, but he's soon to leave korea, and so suggests that ki-woo take over. armed with a fake diploma created by ki-jeong on photoshop, ki-woo successfully applies for the job. the park family, father dong-ik, (lee sun-kyun), mother yeon-gyo (cho yeo-jeong), daughter da-hye (jung ji-so), and son da-song (jung hyeon-jun), welcomes ki-woo into their lavish home, and upon discovering just how wealthy the parks are, the kims hatch an elaborate scheme to oust the park's current domestic staff and take their places. and so, hiding the fact that they're all related, ki-taek is hired as a chauffeur, chung-sook as a housekeeper, and ki-jeong as an art therapist for da-song. however, it doesn't take long before things start to go very, very awry for both families, in ways none of them (or the audience) could ever have imagined.

we live in an era where wealth is distributed upwards and the gap between the haves and have-nots is wider than ever. according to inequality.org, the richest 1% of the world's population controls 45% of global wealth. at the same time, adults with less than $10,000 capital make up 64% of the population and control less than 1% of the wealth. in 2018, oxfam reported that the wealth of the 26 richest people in the world was equal to the combined wealth of the 3.5 billion poorest people. this is the _milieu_ of _parasite_, a film which taps into some of the same ideological thinking as gave rise to ""_hell joseon_"" sentiments, wherein up to 75% of koreans aged 19-34 want to leave the country. 

obviously enough, bong's main themes are class division and class conflict, the artificiality of societal hierarchy, and the concomitant social inequality and differentiation in status that makes such a hierarchy possible in the first place. as thoroughly entertaining (and funny) as the film is, it remains, in essence, an economic treatise, albeit with a savagely satirical quality. however, make no mistake, this is a satire with teeth – the hilarity and playfulness of the long first act give way to a darker political vibe in the second, before bong violently deconstructs his own allegory in the emotionally draining and batshit insane third act, ultimately driving the knife home in an epilogue that's about as different from the film's early scenes as you could imagine. of course, this is far from the first time bong has dealt with issues of class, touching obliquely on similar themes in _sarinui chueok_ [_memories of murder_] (2003), _gwoemul_ [_the host_] (2006), and _madeo_ [_mother_] (2009). _parasite_'s engagement with class and economics, however, is far more overt, aligning it with bong's english-language work, _snowpiercer_ (2013) and _okja_ (2015). never before, however, has he been this caustic, this acerbic, but so too this compassionate, this witty. indeed, _parasite_ feels like a culmination, the film to which he's been building for his entire career.

in the film's press notes, bong states;

>_i think that one way to portray the continuing polarisation and inequality of our society is as a sad comedy. we are living in an era when capitalism is the reigning order, and we have no other alternative. it's not just in korea, but the entire world faces a situation where the tenets of capitalism cannot be ignored. in the real world, the paths of families like our four unemployed protagonists and the park family are unlikely ever to cross. the only instance is in matters of employment between classes, as when someone is hired as a tutor or a domestic worker. in such cases there are moments when the two classes come into close enough proximity to feel each other's breath. in this film, even though there is no malevolent intention either side, the two classes are pulled into a situation where the slightest slip can lead to fissures and eruptions. in today's capitalistic society there are ranks and castes that are invisible to the eye. we keep them disguised and out of sight, and superficially look down on class hierarchies as a relic of the past, but the reality is that there are class lines that cannot be crossed._

in this manner, the film works as a literalisation of the theory that co-existence between the various classes is becoming increasingly difficult; the kims and the parks aren't simply differentiated due to wealth, rather they live in completely different worlds and have vastly different, and largely incompatible, ideologies.

one of the most deftly-handled elements of the film is bong's avoidance of the clichés one so often finds in films dealing with economics – the kims are by no means the default protagonists, a victimised family immediately worthy of sympathy, whilst the parks are by no means the default antagonists, a callous family immediately worthy of scorn. rather, the parks are depicted as perfectly friendly and pleasant whilst the kims are shown to be liars and scoundrels. indeed, it's the kims who are the more crassly materialistic of the two families – obsessed with their mobile phones and whatsapp, we first meet them as they're wandering around their apartment, phones held aloft, trying to pick up their neighbour's wifi signal. later, as they ingratiate themselves with the parks and acquire more and more access to a wealthy lifestyle, all four kims start to carry themselves differently, as if being in such proximity to wealth has had a physiological effect. 

there are no heroes and villains here – bong is uninterested in trucking in black and white oppositions because such rigid diametrics aren't the norm in the real world. for all their scheming and lying, the kims merely con their way into menial jobs, trying to earn enough to make survival a little easier. as for the parks, their wealth has insulated them from the world of families such as the kims, but their greatest crimes are disconnection and ignorance, nothing more. at the same time, the kims are depicted as a far more unified and loving family than the parks. although all four kims regularly occupy the same frame, to the best of my recollection, we never see the four parks together in the same shot; da-hye and da-song rarely leave their rooms, yeon-gyo spends most of her time in the kitchen and living room, and dong-ik is seen most regularly in his car. it's a wonderful bit of cinematic shorthand to convey a thematic point, with bong utilising the visual component of the medium to maximum effect – this is a filmmaker who knows precisely what he's doing.

it's in relation to the two family's status as heroes or villains that the film's title is so important. strictly speaking, the korean title, ""_기생충_"" (""gisaengchung""), means ""helminth"" rather than ""parasite"", but as a helminth is a parasitic worm, the slight difference in the translation isn't a big deal. in any case, a parasitic organism such as a helminth lives in or on a host and takes its nourishment from that host. a simple reading of this is that the kims are the parasites and the parks are the hosts, with the kims feeding off the parks' wealth and status. however, in a film where nothing is as it seems, things aren't that simple. bong depicts the parks as parasites as well – they've been rendered relatively helpless by their wealth, unable to complete basic tasks such as driving or cleaning without the assistant of working-class employees; i.e. they sustain themselves based off of the labour of their servants. and so, just as the kims feed off the parks, the parks feed off the kims, in what quickly becomes a symbiotic relationship. concerning this issue, in his director's statement, bong says,

>_it is increasingly the case in this sad world that humane relationships based on co-existence or symbiosis cannot hold, and one group is pushed into a parasitic relationship with another. in the midst of such a world, who can point their finger at a struggling family, locked in a fight for survival, and call them parasites? it's not that they were parasites from the start. they are our neighbours, friends and colleagues, who have merely been pushed to the edge of a precipice._

however, as strong as the film is narratively and thematically, it also has an aesthetic design to die for. hong kyung-pyo's cinematography, for example, is magnificent. hong also shot lee chang-dong's superb _beoning_ (2018), and the camerawork here has a similar smoothness and restlessness, gliding through the parks house like it's a fifth member of the kim family. lee ha-jun's production design is also praise-worthy, with the kims' and parks' living conditions contrasted in every way; the parks live in a pristine post-modernist semi-open plan house, accessible only by an electronically controlled gate, and hidden from the street by tall trees and dense shrubs; the kims, on the other hand, live in a cluttered and dilapidated apartment with barely any room, their toilet situated beside the aforementioned window looking into an alley.

it's also in relation to production design wherein one of the film's best metaphors is to be found, which is also a great example of just how much of a masterwork this is, how completely bong is in control of his craft. as a film at least partly in the tradition of the ""upstairs/downstairs"" subgenre (think james ivory's _the remains of the day_ or robert altman's _gosford park_), bong literalises the separation between those above and those below insofar as stairways are a recurring motif. the kims live in a basement apartment without stairs, mirroring their stagnation and inability to rise in a socio-economic sense. on the other hand, the parks' lavish home has two main stairways – one going up, the other going down into the cellar. as ki-jeong and ki-woo gain more access to da-song and da-hye, they start to spend most of their time upstairs. ki-taek and chung-sook, however, along with dong-ik and yeon-gyo, spend most of their time downstairs, indicating a fissure between the adults and their children. the stairway to the cellar is its own unique animal, with bong shooting it like he's suddenly directing a horror film (there's a thematic reason for this that i can't go into without spoilers). in this way, he bestows upon it an ominousness that, at first, makes little sense, but ultimately reveals itself to be a spectacular bit of foreshadowing. there's also a third stairway in the park home, one not revealed until late in the second act, but one which has huge narrative and thematic importance.

_parasite_ is a masterpiece, with bong, operating at the peak of his abilities, never putting a foot wrong. it could have been a self-serving and didactic message-movie – a homily to the honour of the poor or a deconstruction of the unhappiness of the rich – but bong is far too talented for that, avoiding rhetorical cant, and allowing the film to find its own space. quite unlike anything i've ever seen, it works as allegory just as well as it works as social realism just as well as it works as comedy just as well as it works as tragedy, and so on. this is cinema as art; it's the best palme d'or winner since terrence malick's _the tree of life_ in 2011 and the best best picture winner since kevin costner's _dances with wolves_ in 1990. bong is currently working with hbo to develop a limited series english-language adaptation, which fills me with dread, but no matter what happens with that project, no matter how good (or bad) it may be, here in 2020, parasite has proven itself very much a game-changer, a film that deserves every bit of praise it's received.",high
6598,"what starts as a seemingly simple premise quickly unfolds into much more. i didn't expect an enhanced perspective into my own life, but that's just what happened. parasite is a timely analysis of the ever-increasing divide between rich and poor, all while being witty enough to make for an exhilarating ride.",high

no doubt about it, <em>'parasite'</em> is a high quality film. it wasn't at all what i had assumed it would be like, it has a much more comedic side to it than i was expecting - and that's a positive. yet, it's still pretty dark. it's a great mix. the plot is one that is very entertaining to see play out - the ending is particularly nuts.

the cast do a fantastic job, especially the main quartet. song kang-ho would be my personal standout, i enjoyed watching him throughout. choi woo-shik is very good too, as are park so-dam and jang hye-jin. all of the onscreen talent do terrific though, from cho yeo-jeong to lee jung-eun.

i don't have any negatives for this, it's a brilliant film. from the cinematography, to the dialogue, to the locations, to the humour. you name it, this produces it on an impressive level.

however, the film kind of gives everything away in the very beginning. straight down to the grand event at the end. so if you're paying attention to glaring, obvious, detail the twist at the other end can be seen easier than a 20mph fastball.

there is a moment of doubt that, maybe the obvious hints were wrong, but right before the action starts the mother gives a speech to absolutely ensure that you, yes, you were right from the start.

and the racism, though toned down, makes it pretty clear that the peaceful and loving event highlighted at the start of the film, isn't just going to be for nostalgic reasons. it's going to be a plot element, only because someone like jordan peele isn't that type that would look at that gesture of 80s kindness favorably.",low

_midway_ is an ambitous film that sets out to follow the united states entry into world war two, from the attack on pearl harbour through to the battle of midway. to tell this story it focuses on two main characters who are also based on real life people. there's ed skrein playing dick best, a pilot on the uss enterprise, and patrick wilson playing intelligence officer edwin layton.

as you might imagine jamming seven months of war into just over two hours is a big task, and while they did manage to pull this off, the result is a movie that feels rushed, where we can't get to know all the many characters, and which probably requires a pretty strong knowledge of this time period in history to understand all the things that are rapidly being thrown on screen.

i actually had a lot of trouble telling who was who in many of the scenes involving the pilots. apart from ed skrein and luke evans the rest of the pilots and rear gunners are such a copy / paste of each other and they come and go so fast on screen that you have zero time to have any kind of emotional connection to them, even though the movie tries to make you feel for them. for a lead actor, skrein is very wooden and uninspiring, and i don't think has shoulders big enough to carry his part of the film.

then, as if the 10,000 mile an hour story is not bad enough, this movie relies very heavily on visual effects. apart from close-ups, everything you see that involves a ship or a plane is entirely cgi and it is woefully bad 99% of the time. i've used the playstation analogy a lot, and this is another example. i feel like if they had cut back the story to not cover so many fights and battles, there would have been a lot less visual effect shots. and with less shots to create and render, perhaps those remaining would have come out looking more realistic. as it is, it really takes you out of the movie - the planes move like they are weightless and defy the laws of physics, the explosions look they were made in aftereffects, and each scene on a ship has that horrible green screen glow about it.

in summary i think this movie suffers from trying to do too much all at once. this came off feeling more like a trilogy of movies about pearl harbour, the doolittle raid, and the battle of midway had been edited down to one single movie. the end result is a rushed film that is hard to follow, whose characters are difficult to connect with, and whose visual effects are video game level at best. this will not go down in history as a great war film.",low
6632,walking into the theater i didnt know what to expect from this movie except two things one to atleast laugh a little and two to be in aww by the shocking content but however what i personally didnt expect was to attend the absolute funniest movie ive seen all year long i laughed out loud nonstop i loved the characters as well this definetly isnt for everyone kids included or anyone offended by sex humor but if you can take it i highly recommend seeing this comedy blockbuster,high
6636,"ok, i'll be honest, i wasn't expecting much and, after seeing the spots on talk shows, i was expecting something far raunchier and with far less sentimentality and heart.

the good news is that i was wrong. my expectations were subverted... and not in the johnson the last jedi, we are going to subvert expectations by not making a genre film kind of way... but in the wow, this has a little more depth than expected kind of way.

no, no, no, no, no... don't let that ruin it for you. trust me, if it was a really deep film, i'd be giving it 1 star out of 10 for false advertisement reasons alone.

it was still sufficiently raunchy, low brow, and vulgar enough to entertain as advertised. it was as advertised.

but, it also had a cuter more innocent story that went along with the sleazy hysterical humor. a story that is actually kind of moving given what you are watching. a story that is actually very moving given how it was advertised... given the genre that it was in... given the highly offensive humor that most of us absolutely love.

and whomever edited it, had their head on their shoulders. watching the cut scenes alone are enough to show you how good boys could have gone wrong, by running too long with jokes that weren't as funny, had the deleted scenes been left in.",high
6642,"“when you come to the end of the line, with a buddy who is more than a brother and a little less than a wife, getting blind drunk together is really the only way to say farewell.”

‘once upon a time in hollywood’ is a chilled blast from the past told like a fairy tale. it’s both aimless and yet meaningful with the commentary on the new era in hollywood. the movie pays tribute to old hollywood, film making, sharon tate, stunt work, and actors. this is perhaps tarantino’s most personal and mature movie his made, until the last 10 minutes (which i love) goes complete ape sh*t.

i can’t think of any other director where the passion and love for movies is so transparent through tarantino's craft. he’s such an old school film maker that he and martin scorsese are the last golden age directors, as every new release feels like an event. in this movie, quentin presents 69’ hollywood at its peak, as he remembers it from his childhood. he manages to rebuild classy la thanks to the crew and creative team. 

bright neon lights, fashionable clothes, and late 60’s automobiles. there’s a couple of scenes where cliff booth (brad pitt), drives around la and there are long shots that shows off the environment and it’s amazing the amount of detail and effort went into the setting - with robert richardson brilliant cinematography bringing it all alive. 

leonardo dicaprio was absolutely excellent as the fading western star, rick f**king dalton. dalton, a self-centered, yet vulnerable actor that you both laugh and pity. i will often forget about dicaprio comedic chops, something similar to ryan gosling. i also like the subtle stutter that’s sprinkled through out, which is sad when given some thought that it’s something he’s got to deal with. there’s a heartfelt scene where dalton tells his young co-star about a book his reading and mid way through explaining the story he realises it mirrors his life, and breaks down in tears with me crying with him. yep, i teared up in a tarantino movie. leo was the pulse of the movie.

brad pitt was amazing as the deadpan and cool cliff booth. this is probably my favorite performance from him. cliff’s main character trait is his strength and he demonstrates it multiple times, but leaves the scene before anything can escalate. the chemistry between leo and brad was electric. pitt was the meat of the movie.

margot robbie was an absolute delight portraying the late sharon tate. despite her slim screen time, but whenever she has screen time, i couldn’t help but smile. i instantly fell in love with her and it’s painfully to think something so sweet and pure could be taken away from us by brainwashed zombies who don’t deserve a life, just a jail cell. i thought her portrayal in the movie was a beautiful tribute and how they handle her gives new life into her legacy. 

there’s a great scene where sharon tate watches a movie in cinemas that’s she’s in, but instead of margot robbie re-creating those scenes, they just show the real sharon tate in the movie. now people were left a bit confused over this decision, although it’s clear to me that erasing the real tate out of the movie would be more disrespectful to her memory, so leaving her in is a touching tribute to her career and her work. robbie was the heart of the movie.

the other supporting cast all did terrific with the little screen time most of them had. kurt russell makes a welcoming return as a character that i assume is stuntman mike from 'death proof' - either way still a welcoming presence. he’s also the narrator and i find it hilarious whenever he tries to pronounce italian movie titles. al pacino was a blast to watch as the tight and yet colorful producer. mike moh portrayal of bruce lee may have sparked some controversy recently, but i thought he was entertaining regardless and i don’t really think it mocks his legacy at all. i mean, this is the same director who made a four hour movie honoring the legend. margaret qualley was crazy good as the hippie girl who’s brain washed into a cult family. it’s crazy to know that damon herriman has played charles manson twice in the same year and month for this movie and the tv show ‘mindhunter’, which you should totally check out by the way.

julia butters, luke perry, timothy olyphant, dakota fanning, bruce dern, and damian lewis - a stellar cast that did a stellar job.

after letting the film sit for awhile, there’s so many memorable lines that i would often catch myself recreating just from memory after seeing it twice. there’s so many great moments as well. the lights of la coming to life at the dust of dawn, or the suspenseful scenes that actually got me feeling tense watching it. without spoiling anything, but the spahn ranch scene where the manson family stares down a defenseless cliff booth as he tries to speak to an old friend was terrifying - reminds me of the opening scene of ‘inglorious bastards’, in terms of building up tension that you wait in anticipation to explode.

still, i think this is the best representation of the manson family i’ve seen in any movie...by portraying them as absolute buffoons.

and of course with it being a tarantino movie, the music is lost treasure revived for a modern generation. always fantastic and incredibly catchy. i can’t think of anything better than cliff driving around la with the song ‘bring a little lovin’ playing in the background.

overall rating: i’ve seen this movie twice already and i still have a desire to watch it again. this is slowly creeping up to being my favorite quentin tarantino movie, but time will tell i guess.",high
6643,"i found this to be an excellent movie despite (or partly because of) major variance from the historic events it is based on.

up until watching this movie, i had just seen four tarantino films, so i guess i am not on his bandwagon. but i really enjoyed two of them (jackie brown and pulp fiction). i can now say i liked once upon a time in hollywood just as much as i did those two movies. 

the dialogue is sharp and the main characters are sympathetic enough so i cared what happened to them. the film is loosely based on actual events, with fictional characters thrown in and at least one major plot change that i won't give away. i think some of the most negative feedback i have seen about this film were from purists who didn't like the major change in the story. but i appreciated the change. if i want total accuracy, i would watch a documentary, but i want to be entertained, not depressed, and i was.

and i plan to watch it again, not just for the sake of the story, but because maybe the second time through i will catch more of the movie references that are supposed to inhabit tarantino's films.",high

6645,"ok, i'm giving it 10 stars, not because it's a great film and not because it's one of qt's best films... but because compared to everything else out there today it is a masterpiece.

however, unfortunately, anyone that has seen all of qt's films, the ending is spoiled from the start purely on the basis that we understand how he treats history.

and, unfortunately, for some people it is a very slow burner, but one with absolutely fantastic acting and directing. it's a slow burner that is a brilliant period piece, and it is a slow burner that is almost a love letter to classic hollywood, so though it takes nearly forever for any real pay off, its a fine film to actually watch and one that maintains a quality of entertainment and leaves little clues peppered throughout of the coming payoff.

and the clues are important as they are, essentially, little promises that the film is making for the finale.

the finally, however is so ultra-violent, so over-the-top that it's absolutely hysterical.

it's not his best film, but its certainly loyal to his others, gone however is the quick witted and quotable dialogue that marked his earlier films, but it is traded off for a sleek professionalism of a seasoned director.",high
6646,"“is everybody okay?” “well... the fuckin' hippies aren't. that's for goddamn sure.”

i have watched this film in the cinema when it first came out in 2019, but didn’t think it was that great. after my second watch, 4 years and a good 550 other movies later, i liked it much better. 

once upon a time… in hollywood is essentially a love letter to cinema, a fairytale filled with jokes and references and a deep supporting cast. the film spends most of the time hanging out with its characters; there are plenty of scenes were we can enjoy dicaprio giving a hell of a performance, or pitt being effortlessly cool. the fairytale ends in a hilarious climax—an unexpected twist in appropriate tarantino style—and they lived happily ever after.

obviously, joker is one of my most anticipated movies of 2019. i mean, how couldn't it be?! besides belonging to the superhero genre, dc has been on a streak of great films within its universe, so an isolated installment definitely excites me, especially about one of the evilest villains ever. it's by far one of the less comic-book-y flicks of the century. it doesn't follow the generic origin story formula, it avoids any cliches associated with the genre, and it's the type of movie that's becoming more and more rare nowadays. it's a character study like we haven't seen in a long time.

i'll simply begin with the person that elevates the entire thing: joaquin phoenix. now, if there's something i'm not going to do is compare his performance with heath ledger's. that's the number one mistake people are going to keep making forever. first of all, the dark knight and joker couldn't be more distinct films, even if they belong to the same genre (despite joker being unique, it's still about a famous comic-book villain). then, despite phoenix and ledger portraying the same ""version"" of the clown (crazy, sadistic psychopath), the former is 90% arthur fleck while the latter is 100% joker, throughout each of their movies. finally, phoenix is the sole protagonist of this feature, while ledger had the best live-action batman sharing the spotlight.

in conclusion, it's both unfair, and a bit unreasonable to compare both interpretations since their roles have a different impact on the narrative, as well as each film being entirely different. in the end, both are impressive. however, let's switch to phoenix since he's the star of this show … he has 2019's best performance, by far! with a strong marketing campaign, i'm sure he'll get that oscar. i hope so! it's so well-deserved. todd phillips and scott silver developed a brilliant screenplay, but phoenix elevates it to a whole other level.

throughout the entire runtime, i felt weird. perturbed. even uncomfortable with what i was watching and consequently feeling. it's a dark, brutal, violent, emotionally powerful origin of a villain who i feel disturbingly empathetic towards. phoenix makes the story work due to its remarkably captivating display of someone who's mentally ill. arthur fleck slowly becoming crazier is due to how society behaves and not due to some chemical pool that transforms his skin white and hair green (nothing wrong with this, but i know which origin story i prefer). ""the world is getting crazier out there"", and it becomes excruciatingly painful to deal with it, especially when so much is going on with arthur’s personal life, and most of it he doesn't even realize because he tries to hide everything behind a smile.

it's a screenplay filled with narrative twists that not only pack a punch of surprise but leave you feeling extremely upset. the last act is one of the best in the last few years. if the second act is an enormous build-up, the last one is a terrific payoff. i can't remember the last movie i saw where i loved 100% every single narrative decision. i wouldn't do any of the big moments differently. there are so many excellent references hidden in plain sight that comic-book fans (and fans of the tdk trilogy as well) will love just like i did. in the ending, there's one pivotal moment in particular that serves as the absolute climax … i got chills all over my body. they couldn't have done that scene more perfect. i only have one tiny nitpick with the way some scenes feel repetitive since they neither move the plot forward or give us anything new. some of these still help to create tension, some feel like they're just… there.

a best picture and best actor nominations seem to be on its way, but these are not the only achievements that deserve to be recognized. the original score by hildur guðnadóttir is incredibly addictive, so much that i'm listening to it while writing this review. it definitely helps to generate tremendous build-up, and it elevates the sinister environment of gotham city. lawrence sher's cinematography is utterly stunning. the underexposure of some scenes is glorious. sher paints the screen with so many gorgeous shots, especially with his close-ups on phoenix, where the latter is able to shine. jeff groth is also impeccable in the editing room. there are several long takes with phoenix just giving his all and letting all his emotions out (or keeping them all contained), which is always something i deeply appreciate since it helps with the flow of the narrative.

regarding the film's controversy surrounding its messages and the incentive to violence, i really don't know what to say. it's ridiculous. i remember those times when going into the movie theater was a surreal experience. it was the number one place for people to forget about their lives, jobs, everything. joker is a fictional story! it's the origin of one of the worst psychopaths in the history of comic-books and cinema. if people expected to leave the theater ""happy"" or ""joyful"", then at least one of the film's message is right: society really is getting crazier. have people forgotten who joker is? what could you possibly expect from his origin story?!

nowadays, no one knows how to behave (social media is the primary source for spreading hate). no one respects the fellow citizen or even the world itself. more and more people only look at their own bellies. political agendas are everywhere. new extreme movements are created every other year. social hypersensibility is exponentially growing. the same way some people will hate this movie for not being able (or simply not wanting) to accept that they feel empathy towards a murderer, people all around the world behave like their actions don't reflect on another person's life and on their own planet. if people get ruthlessly violent because they watched joker, how can someone complain that the film's message is bad when it's eventually true?

all in all, joker is one of the best movies of the year, and it's definitely on my top3 at the date of this review. joaquin phoenix delivers my favorite male performance of 2019, by elevating a script about the origin of one of the evilest villains ever. the way he gradually becomes more insane is worthy of study, but it's how he's able to make the audience create empathy towards a psychopath that leaves me disturbingly captivated. todd phillips produces a character-study filled with an astonishingly tense build-up and one of the most chill-inducing payoffs of the last few years. with every single narrative decision nailed perfectly, hildur guðnadóttir's score and lawrence sher's cinematography stand out. the lack of restraint in showing the unmerciful violence (physical and mental) that society inflicts on one another is what makes us feel unsettled. because we know it's mostly true, and we refuse to accept it. it's not a film about the joker. it's a very realistic portrayal of someone (anyone!) who can become someone like him. and it's disturbingly brilliant!

ps: robert deniro (murray franklin) and zazie beetz (sophie dumond) are also great. phoenix's performance is so mesmerizing that i almost forgot there were other actors in the movie.

6650,"the joker is similar to the dc joker character but is not a criminal genius. the movie was a great depiction of how a person who has been mistreated, lied to, and ignored, totally lacking access to human compassion, can snap. the acting is top notch, and it puts a spotlight on the importance of mental health in modern times.",high
6652,"*a masterpiece*.

the movie shows the escalating events that made arthur become the joker. initially an inoffensive poor and sick man, arthur suffered a tide of unfortunate events that pushed him closer and closer to the edge. 

ignored and despised by everyone, sick and alone in the world, and neglected by the state, arthur becomes progressively more violent until he breaks.

much more than one more super-hero movie, *joker* uses well-known characters to promote the reflection on the ""ignored"" ones. at least, ignored until they become a joker.",high
6654,"_joker_ is a tour-de-force of a movie, not quite like anything i've seen, maybe since taxi driver. at its core it's a movie about the breaking point of a broken man, wrapped under the banner of a comic book movie that, take out the waynes, works on its own.
joaquin phoenix truly gives a transformative performance (not unlike heath ledger) and will say is deserving of an academy award. the supporting cast all did well, though, and it is a small role, zazie beetz was great and de niro had his moments, particularly at the end.

got to hand it to todd phillips, between this and the good, albeit flawed, war dogs, has proven to be more than those hangover movies.

6657,"this is going to be one of those posts where i go against the mainstream but my reaction when i watched this movie was: you got to be f… kidding me?

the only resemblance to the real joker in this movie is the name. as far as i am concerned this movie is an insult to the fans of batman and the real joker.

the “joker” in this move is a unintelligent deranged nutcase. there is a sob story in the background about how he became that way which is totally uninteresting.

the real joker is a intelligent criminal mastermind. i was waiting for this nutcase to actually become that for the entire movie. spoiler alert, it never happened! this guy starts as a useless sobbing nutcase and he ends the movie as the same useless sobbing nutcase.

the movie has nothing to do with the real joker. it is a blatant attempt to garner support for a unrelated psychopathic thriller by using the joker name. if it would have been advertised as such i probably would have, if not liked it, so at least appreciated it for it’s qualities. it is indeed a well done movie technically and the main character is indeed excellently performed.

however, even if i try to distance myself from the deceitful joker label, i find it overall boring, too long and really a movie about a psychopath probably made by someone with mental issues himself. but then that’s hollywood today.

that the politically biased and elitist so called “critics” on sites like rotten tomatoes like it is not really surprising but i have to confess that i am somewhat surprised at the rave ratings by real viewers on some other sites.

honestly, i was expecting to be disappointing by this movie. then i am always cautious about movies getting rave reviews, especially from the previously mentioned totally useless and crappy “review” site. i did not expect this level of disappointment though. epic fail as far as i am concerned.",low

i was fully aware of <em>'joker'</em> ever since its release, impossible not to be given the extraordinary hype that surrounded it, but it still absolutely surpassed my expectations - a sensational film. i adored every second of this; and i'm not even a joker/dc comics etc. 'fan'.

joaquin phoenix gives an astonishingly outstanding performance as the titular character, undoubtedly one of the greatest showings that i've ever seen from an actor. i'm not one that takes notice of awards, but he is fully deserving of anything of that ilk that he won due to this. quality!

everything else about the film is fantastic. great score, great cinematography, great pacing... it's all just utterly superb and makes for a spectacular watch. i love that they avoided just going wall-to-wall crazy with this, don't get me wrong things get mad but there's more to it than just violence et al.

the joker is also seen dancing on a car in the midst of the rioting, surrounded by people shouting his name. making them an embodiment of ""hero"" in order for them to share their ideas.

sometimes, people ask me if i feel less motivated to write about a movie i didn’t like or even simply hated. not even close. matter of fact, it might be the exact opposite. the only films which i find hard to write a review on are those who don’t have a single aspect that is either outstanding or horrible. those who are so “in the middle” that you forget about them less than 24h after you’ve seen it. 47 meters down: uncaged could very well be this type of flick, but its ludicrous logical issues story-wise are impossible to ignore. even the title is just a marketing scheme to attract people who liked the 2017’s original since it is entirely unrelated to it (the water depth at which the characters are is never addressed).

this is one of the worst movies of the year. it still doesn’t beat serenity, but it made me rethink about the latter’s grade because i find it so incredibly difficult to acknowledge one single good thing about this terrible sequel. had i scored matthew mcconaughey’s film an f, this one would probably belong there as well. however, in the same way that a film without flaws isn’t necessarily an a+, a movie with no redeeming quality isn’t instantly an f. if there’s one compliment i can give uncaged is that there are two or three short sequences where a jump scare is effective, or the suspenseful vibe was accomplished … nevertheless, these are still just a couple of minutes in an almost 90-min runtime.

the characters have no development whatsoever. the story follows the most pathetic path possible. the sharks (which are the reason people actually went to the theater) are not as visually realistic as in the original, reaching a point where the cgi was pretty awful. a fish screams … i mean, really?! who the hell supervised this mess? characters talk underwater seamlessly with no explanation on how they are effectively talking. i could sit here and write dozens of questions that defy the film’s logic, but i’ll stop here. not because i don’t want to (if this wasn’t a spoiler-free review, i’d go crazy), but due to the fact that the main issue with the movie isn’t the atrociously illogical plot points, but the lack of entertainment.

fast and furious, pirates of the caribbean, transformers … all of these are (financially) successful franchises. audiences all over the world fill theaters and enjoy these series for what they are: popcorn entertainment. no one goes for the complex plots or layered characters. people go for the action, the explosions, the epic scores, the visual effects, and all of that stuff. uncaged doesn’t have any of that to compensate its other problems. one or two scenes here and there aren’t enough to warrant the price of admission. even the acting is mediocre. 

all in all, 47 meters down: uncaged is nothing more than a silly attempt at the start of a new franchise. don’t be fooled by its title since it has nothing to do with the original flick. it doesn’t try to introduce compelling characters, the shark sequences fall flat for the most part, and the screenplay is filled with laughable plot points. there’s no sense of logic. for an 89-minute runtime, it astounds me how it can’t be slightly entertaining, to say the least. undoubtedly, one of the worst films of the year. skip it, so they don’t have enough money to try and do a third one. who knows?! maybe they’ll bet on original, smaller flicks from genuinely talented filmmakers who want to work hard and deliver a good movie.

rating: d-",low
6667,"‘47 metres down: uncaged’ doesn’t have the inventiveness  of ‘the shallows’, the intensity and drive of ‘crawl’, the fun of ‘the meg’ or the gore of ‘piranha 3d’ but, for a few fleeting moments, it does feel vaguely like an underwater version of ‘the descent’. if only the film would have let the characters shut the fuck up a little more and let me enjoy those aspects.

only notable thing about this cast is two of them are children of a famous parent actor (jamie foxx/corinne foxx, sylvester stallone/sistine stallone).

i made a quick search on imdb and it looked like it might, finally, be a good french made movie. apart from louis de funès comedies that is, i really love most of those.

well, it turned out to be a huge disappointment. i guess i should have checked a bit more. for instance the fact that the oxygen wasting “critics” at rotten sjw tomatoes gave it a 100% rating should have been a red flag. or maybe the ludicrous non-descriptive one liner description of the movie. i mean, it’s like buying a car from a dealer that says “it’s a cool car”.

well, in my gaming days i was a great fan of submarine simulators, especially ww2 ones, so i guess i got suckered.

for starters, the premise of the movie itself, once you start watching that is, is nonsensical. one, i say one, missile is fired against french territory, it is assumed to be nuclear, no real evidence, and france decides to retaliate while said missile is still in flight. seriously?

that’s something that north korea would do. not a civilized country and despite the fact that france right now has the worst president in modern history i would still say france counts as a civilized country.

the the movie starts with some “action” and here we are immediately shown that the writer is totally clueless as far as any form of military procedures, strategy or … well.. whatever. a nuclear submarine surfaces, the captain, the captain, goes up in the conning tower and fires a hand held sam on a chopper sent from a destroyer nearby. oh, by the way, he forgot to remove the safety on the first try. the destroyer does absolutely nothing during this exchange. you’re fucking kidding me ???

then the movie spends a shitload of time with the hero moping and moaning and being unfairly treated by the hierarchy. the film got really boring at this point. the one good part is that the superior officers, at the end, is actually the most competent characters in the movie.

when the action finally starts again it’s … well the same crap as before. utterly unbelievable and totally unrealistic. even the dumbass president macron would, hopefully, known that a nuclear strike cannot be called off just like that. and when it finally comes to blows, for some reason, the “enemy” submarine has all kinds of countermeasures while the “good guys” never launches any. as i wrote before, the writer is clueless.

now it seems that that critics are ok with giving it a low rating, so long as they still only praise it in the prose review...just in case.

so, think of it like the gibson version of ""what women want"" and then make it raunchy and vulgar to the point of repulsion with views of the opposite sex that would get a lot of men arrested.

and then think if it as slightly androphobic...and slightly as in the androphobia is racially based which makes it clear that the message of this film is to virtue signal how woke the they are by making it clear that a certain skin color and gender are evil.

i don't even know how to start this review… marriage story is one of those movies that stays with me long after i've finished it. i've been thinking about it a lot, and it's undoubtedly one of the most realistic dramas i've ever seen. that's due to the award-worthy performances of adam driver (charlie barber) and scarlett johansson (nicole barber), but also because of noah baumbach's incredibly layered screenplay. in addition to this, baumbach is undeniably one of the best directors of the year. with the help of his dp, robbie ryan, he sets the platform for driver and johansson to shine as the astonishing actors that they are.

some people watch films to forget their daily issues. some just want to have fun. some want to learn more about a particular true story. however, there's not a single person alive who wants to watch a movie and not be able to leave the theater (or, in this case, their couch) entertained. marriage story has such an emotionally complicated premise that it's tough to convince people to sit and watch. i mean, who wants to watch a divorce develop throughout more than two hours? who wants to watch two people who were once in love with each other become the worst of themselves? yelling, fighting, court, custody, lawyers… it's not exactly an attention-grabber.

i imagine people who went through the same situation getting triggered and remember a phase of their lives that was probably one of their worst. i'm writing this because i've seen some negativity towards people who simply don't want to watch baumbach's depiction of a depressing event. it's perfectly understandable if anyone decides to skip this one, especially if it hits too close to home. in my case, i've never gone through a divorce (hopefully, i'll never will), and usually i can ""enjoy"" this type of sad, frustrating, bittersweet films (manchester by the sea, a ghost story) for what they are, no matter how tragic.

if i had to choose one-word praise: realistic. there's no way around it. the palpable emotions are the main reason why this story works so well. only people who have never been in a relationship of any kind can't understand the moment when a fight starts to escalate, and the couple begins to say terrible stuff at each other that they don't exactly mean. the exaggeration and over-the-top arguments are part of every couple's life. they can occur due to a hundred reasons related to stress, work, accumulation of little things, or simply because it's just not a good day.

marriage story doesn’t deliver a hopeful message or a sweet story because that’s not what divorces are. it’s not difficult to imagine how hard it is to separate yourself from the person you love(d) for years without end, even more when there’s a kid involved in the process. baumbach could have followed the genre cliches and provide moments of pure happiness, but that’s not something that happens during a situation like this. it’s a heart-wrenching phase to live through, and i believe that this movie is going to be thoroughly analyzed in film school in the next decade or so.

the scene with driver and johansson going at each other exponentially harder and heavier criticism-wise is one of the most emotionally powerful dialogues of the millennium. the raw emotion and the physical movements that both actors can bring into the fight are absurdly impressive. their chemistry is so inexplicably real. i never, not even for a single second, thought that i was watching fictional characters. nicole and charlie can very well be our neighbors or part of our family. baumbach's use of long takes really elevate every single sequence, allowing the protagonists to move around the set and actually act.

technically, there's no better acting this year than what driver and johansson deliver. both are always moving and doing a lot of things while giving their lines. making dinner, drinking tea, going to the bathroom, chopping a carrot, blowing their nose, standing up, sitting down, walking around the room, crying, smiling, laughing… all of this in a single take! several times!! scarlett shows more emotion throughout the runtime than her counterpart, but adam proves why he's the frontrunner at the 2019's oscars. his restraint when charlie is trying to be polite even though he's mad, or his explosive behavior when his character decides to finally let go (excellent build-up), are some of the attributes that make his performance my favorite of the year.

not trying to diminish johansson's display. both deliver career-best performances, in my opinion. both deserve every award that exists. the supporting cast is also impeccable, and i know that laura dern (nora fanshaw) is probably going to be nominated. still, the two leads are so engaging and captivating that i couldn't be impressed with anyone else. the only person to rise to the main actors' level is noah baumbach himself. with the best screenplay of 2019, he offers the audience an incredibly complex story, filled with subtle details and exceptional dialogue.

he controls the movie's pacing beautifully, and he knows the right moments to insert a little joke to lighten up the dark, depressing mood. my only issue with the film has to do with its replay value. we all have been through this situation: watching a fantastic movie, only once, and never again. marriage story is going to be one of those films for me. i love everything about it, but i know the chances of a rewatch are very, very small. it's a profoundly unsettling story, super uncomfortable at times, and i really don't want to go through the sadness and frustration all over again.

all in all, noah baumbach delivers what i believe to be its career-best flick, marriage story. with the best screenplay of 2019, as well as one the best directions, this is the closest the world is ever going to get to a realistic depiction of a divorce. scarlett johansson and adam driver also give the best performances of their lives, elevating every single scene, dialogue, argument, or joke. the long takes allow them to shine and actually work as actors, moving around the set and doing domestic/job tasks, while delivering their lines. technically, both baumbach and the entire cast are absolutely perfect. it's an extremely emotional narrative, very depressing, sad, and even uncomfortable at times, which might scare some people off, especially if they've been through this. despite its replay value being affected (a rewatch is very unlikely), it's a phenomenal lesson in storytelling that stays with us long after it's finished. easily, one of the best movies of 2019. don't miss it, and try not to cry.

6710,"“i never really came alive for myself; i was only feeding his aliveness.”

i’ve said some harsh things about netflix movies in the past, but recently i’m starting to warm up to them.

‘marriage story’ was absolutely excellent. a devastating portrayal of divorce that can bring out the ugly in people, especially with child custody. but it’s not all doom and gloom. it’s incredibly heartfelt with plenty of humorous moments. i guess you have to find the comedy during the difficulties in life. lets just say my cheeks wasn’t dry afterwards.

and yes, i wept.

adam driver and scarlett johansson both gave masterclass performances. and i do mean some power house acting. driver plays charlie, a competitive and undaunted theater director that he is very clear about what he wants. johansson plays nicole, a mother who’s a delightful presence and loves to play, but is also a dedicated actor. this is the best i’ve seen from johnasson. her character delivers a monologue where she’s explains the issues in her life that’s all shot in one take, which brilliantly displays her acting chops where she naturally shifts from emotion to emotion - it was impeccable.

the supporting cast were all fantastic. lauren dern, ray liotta, merritt wever, julie hagerty, and alan alda were all brilliant and really bounce off the energy from driver and johansson. even the child actor held his own between these juggernauts of actors.

not only are the performances the strongest element of the movie, but so is the writing. every character is so uniquely fleshed out that the conflict feels so incredibly raw. it’s one of the reasons why i was so glued to the movie from start to finish. one of the best screenplays of the year.

this is the first noah baumbach movie i’ve seen from him and i am aware of his other work, just haven’t got around to watching them. however, i feel like this was the best introduction to him as a director, because he crafted such a sympathetic look on marriage dissolving away. we don’t see the full relationship, but we do get to hear nicole and charlie individually describe what their love about each other, while there’s a montage that flash’s through their routine life together with their son. nothing visually striking in the presentation, but not once did it feel stale.

the score from randy newman was terrific and fitted wonderfully with the movie. i loved the aspect ratio as it added a lot to the overall mood of the movie. when the two go head to head in the custody battle - that doesn't mean they’re enemies. they still talk to each other as if they are still a thing. it’s also hard to pick aside, because you understand where each of them are coming from, and even if you do choose, you still feel bad for either one.

i love weird movies. the seemingly awkward moments, the apparently nonsensical ambiguity, or simply the pure wtf sequences... all of these leave me deeply captivated by what the story and its filmmaker are trying to transmit to their viewers. the lighthouse is the most recent addition to the group of psychological horror films that will make you think, ""what the hell am i watching?"" nevertheless, this is one of the most accessible ""weird flicks"" since most of the story is easily explainable.

therefore, i hope this robert eggers' movie gets a successful home release. usually, the general public heavily dislikes ambiguous films. nowadays, people want everything at the palm of their hands before they even watch the movie (aka trailers). so, a film about two lighthouse keepers who go crazy, where dozens of scenes apparently make no sense (they do), can fail to catch the viewers' attention. however, it found mine. filmed in black-and-white and with a 1.19:1 aspect ratio (almost squared), eggers delivers a gorgeous-looking piece of cinema.

people tend to (wrongly) associate the use of black-and-white with ""old movies,"" but it's really just another color palette. for example, blade runner 2049 and mad max: fury road use the color yellow in such a beautiful, eyegasmic way. color can affect us emotionally, psychologically, and even physically, often without us becoming aware. the lighthouse's black-and-white establishes the film's mood from the very beginning. a very somber, sad, dark environment, filled with creepy seagulls, and brutal weather conditions.

if i try to imagine the movie with color, it's not going to be very different from what it actually is. there's no sun, only tons of rain, wind, and waves. it's always cloudy, and inside the house, it's still dark and cold. so, even if eggers decided to film with color, black, grey, and white would be the predominant tones either way. that's why the decision to make this film in black-and-white is so perfect. every shot is dripping with visual beauty. amazing wide shots of robert pattinson working like a slave, getting hit by the relentless weather, all accompanied by a haunting score which elevates every sequence.

in my point of view, it's a story about how solitude can make anyone run away from reality. lack of human contact never contributes to a good way of living. imagining a better life or literally run away to a remote place with a non-stop job to make you forget who you are or what you did, are not going to help anyone overcome what is, in fact, a personal issue. it's a narrative given to many interpretations, so no one is right or wrong. depending on our life experience and on our distinct personalities, each and every one of us can have a different perspective and understanding of what this movie tells through the eggers brothers' brilliant screenplay.

one thing is certain: robert pattinson and especially willem dafoe should be considered for the awards season. however, this film is too weird and ominous to be awarded any nominations, unfortunately. dafoe is 64-years-old, and he crawls on the muddy ground, he gets hit with rain and literal sh*t in the face, besides delivering a versatile performance. both he and pattinson offer a dynamic range of acting, going from absurdly hilarious to intensely dramatic displays. it's probably pattinson's best performance to date, but dafoe shines as a crazy old ex-sailor.

their accents are perfect, and dafoe's ability to ""sing"" complex (linguistically speaking) sea poems for whole uncut takes is worthy of every single oscar. that's something i wasn't expecting: there's a lot of long takes that become even more impressive due to the actors' undeniable talent. it's been a long time since i had to read subtitles to actually understand what the characters were saying, especially dafoe. besides the strong accents, the dialogues are extraordinarily intricate and wordy, which definitely captures my attention since i have to be twice as focused.

incredible cinematography, great editing, and a subtle but powerful score. it's a shame if people ignore this movie's existence. it's not getting released in my country, so i'll try my best to make people see it. unfortunately, it's being ignored by every major award ceremony, which is pretty unfair, having in mind it's one of the best films of 2019. i don't have a single issue with it. some people might not enjoy its ambiguity or its slow pacing. still, i genuinely love how everything falls into place, culminating in a shocking, suspenseful, and tense third act that makes the massive build-up worthy of merit.

all in all, the lighthouse is one of my favorite movies of 2019. it's definitely going into my top10, and way up there. filmed in beautiful black-and-white with a claustrophobic aspect ratio, robert eggers delivers a story about loneliness and isolation that takes the weirdest, craziest route. it's one of those wtf films that will leave everyone thinking about it. i love its ambiguity, even if most of its story is pretty accessible. packed with suspense and tension, mostly due to the excellent cinematography and the brilliant decision to use black-and-white to set the dark, cold environment. robert pattinson delivers his career-best performance, but willem dafoe steals the spotlight with an oscar-worthy crazy display that will be ignored due to the known genre bias. it's tear-inducing hilarious at times, but powerfully dramatic as well. i have not a single complaint, and i love it more the more i think about it. please, watch this at home if you get a chance. don't miss it!

time to spill the beans…’the lighthouse’ is a masterpiece! i loved loved loved loved it! i loved every minute of it. one of my favorite movies of 2019 and i honestly don’t think anything can top it. a slow descent into madness that creeps into your subconscious and won’t be leaving anytime soon.

from the very first frame, i immediately knew this was going to be special. i was hooked throughout until the end credits. 

willem dafoe and robert pattinson both deliver career defining performances. they play off each others insanity beautifully. i could tell just from the accents and dialect that plenty of homework went into making an authentic portrayal of the time.

robert pattinson is fantastic as a quiet and private lighthouse keeper that witness the madness slowly unfolding, but also feeds the audiences curiosity on revealing the strange happenings on the island. pattinson is a chameleon when it comes to portraying characters. 

willem dafoe, on the other hand, was mesmerizing as the old sea dog captain with a love for farting. his long and insane monologues are the main highlights, because it was so electrifying to watch it was hard not be captivated. he’s strict and often unpredictable, but once you see it, you won’t forget it. 

i hope robert eggers continues making horror movies in the future, because right now he’s one of the best living directors working today. the slow-burn tension and lack of conventional scares seems to be his trademark so far. every choice he made was so carefully thought out and the results is masterful. according to eggers, they actually built a lighthouse from scratch and everything we see, including the weather, is genuine. even if some tricky was used, it was so seamless i couldn’t tell what was fake.

i loved how the movie was shot; the dim black-and-white with the claustrophobic aspect ratio, giving it the appearance of a silent film born like a german expressionism - something you would’ve mistaken for a 1920/30’s horror folklore. perfectly captures the time period and the overall dread. you really do feel cut off from the outside world and abandoned on this spectral-like island, and this black sheet of cloud strongly looming over the two men. a dark force in all directions, unseen but very eerie. the cold and heartless weather is a character itself. a big bully with salty intentions. 

i adored the use of lighting through out, as the only light source is either natural light during daytime or candle lit lanterns, which cast many shadows that adds to the unease. there’s some gorgeous looking cinematography on display here. seriously, even as am writing this right now i can memorize every single frame of this strange nightmare of a film. absolutely breathtaking.

while the movie is mainly horror, but there is comedy sprinkled throughout that was actually pretty hilarious. everything from dafoe farting and some creative insults the characters would often spit at each other, which would later expand into long monologues that i sat back and watch in awe with a stupid grin on my face, because how something so silly can be so poetic. never have i seen a movie that perfectly balances more than one genre so fluently. you can laugh at the moments where it’s suppose to be funny, but also take it seriously whenever it’s suppose to be taken seriously, which is sometimes all in one scene. the writing from eggers is so excellent. 

after only one viewing there was a lot i could easily dissect in terms of interpretation. there's masculinity and greek mythology imagery that demonstrates a striking sense of power. there’s also a certain idea of sexuality being a sacred thing and the frustration it may bring. or maybe it’s just a simple story about two guys on a rock getting drunk and then getting even drunker while holding each other until they drift off to sleep. 

overall rating: one of the best looking horror comedies of 2019.",high
6741,"i was worried that my enormously high expectations for 'the lighthouse' would set me up for inevitable disappointment, but to my relief and awe, it somehow exceeded them. this is an extraordinary, baffling, hypnotic, maddening, hilarious, disturbing, disorienting, arousing, absolute mindfuck of a film, drenched in mud and sweat and salt and booze and shit and semen and piss and blood, primal screams of rage and terror, the laughter of madmen and the sobs of the damned, the cry of seabirds and the roar of the sea and the cataclysm of gods and men at war. it haunts you long after it is over, swills in your mind like an aged whisky, and in the days since seeing it, i can't tell you how desperately i want to dive back in again. after delivering arguably the greatest horror film so far this century, robert eggers has created another insane american masterpiece, the kind of film dreams and nightmares are made of. it was worth every single second of the wait.

“i’ve got no idea what i just watched, but i loved it” - those were my exact words as the credits rolled on _the lighthouse_.

i’d been chomping at the bit to watch this ever since seeing the first trailer, and recently it’s finally became available for rent on youtube. starring willem dafoe and robert pattinson? what’s this weird looking square framed black and white movie all about i hear you say? here’s the offical description:

_two lighthouse keepers try to maintain their sanity while living on a remote and mysterious new england island in the 1890s._

with the same director as _the vvitch_ at the helm you get a very good idea of the madness that is about to ensue. and oh boy does madness ensue. in what might be the most perfectly cast movie ever, pattinson and dafoe were absolutely the right choice for these roles. the characters they play as we meet them are somewhat stereotypical - dafoe is the weatherbeaten man of the sea, and pattinson is the guy with a murky past who might be trying to escape from something. their relationship goes from dislike to begrudging respect to...well it’s hard to say what happens after that...

the artistic decision to film in black and white on 35mm film in an almost square ratio heightens everything. it feels claustrophobic, the characters stare directly at you at times, the framing is perfect, it’s a a sight to behold. this film reminded me of everything from silent films of the 1920s through to the creep-fest known as _begotten_. strap yourself in for a ride that will make you clench your teeth at the beautiful destruction. 

as you can probably tell, i loved this movie. it won’t be for everyone as it’s very much an arthouse piece and doesn’t follow the standard norms for film, but i encourage everyone to give it a shot. you’ll either love it or hate it. as for me, i’m just gutted i never got to see this in a theatre because i reckon it would have blown my mind.",high
6746,"to me this is a perfect film. the emotional ebbs and flows of the narrative wash over you and one moment you're laughing then dread overwhelms you. it's expertly crafted both technically and artistically. even the sound design lingered with me for days afterward. 


it's not a film for everyone. the narrative is far from typical, the dialogue is a heavy dialect, and it's one you have to be absorbed in. it's not a passive movie, it's one that challenges you to immerse yourself in it. but, if you're into something truly unique you will find this film to burrow deep into your psyche.",high
6748,"i really enjoyed this movie. right out of the gate, you must accept that it is a fantasy rather than science-fiction, because the latter genre usually tries to give some sort of explanation for why something happens, but here we just take it as it is. 

the dialogue is mostly witty and fun, and the characters got my sympathy. i had a slight problem with the two lead characters having always been platonic, as it was never fully explained why that was. but i was able to put that aside. plus i really liked seeing the third lead character, the mini cooper (okay, yes, i have owned one for nearly twenty years).

part of the ending could be considered predictable, and part of it was, but another piece of the conclusion astonished me in its originality, so it worked for me. one interesting subplot revolved around a couple of people who shared the knowledge about the beatles that drives the story, and i was surprised and pleased at how they resolved that subplot. 

and yes, to deal with the elephant in the room, most of the songs presented in the movie were better when the beatles performed them, but isn't that the point? i had no problem setting that fact aside and enjoying this harmless and entertaining film. oh, and i appreciate what a good sport ed sheeran is in this movie, allowing the lead character to more or less beat him in a songwriting contest (though of course ed really won). in this movie, everybody wins (well, except of course for the fictional beatles, unless you can imagine they would prefer where the fantay lands them.)",high
6749,"whether the ultimate failure of ‘3 from hell’ lies in a troubled production or creative exhaustion on the part of rob zombie, this shambling revenant of a film is something that might only be appreciated by the most indiscriminate midnight-movie crowd and diehard fans of the series.

jessica rothe leads the follow-up to blumhouse's surprise 2017 smash hit of riveting, repeating twists and comic turns. this time, our hero tree gelbman (rothe) discovers that dying over and over was surprisingly easier than the dangers that lie ahead. jason blum once again produces, and christopher landon returns to write and direct this next chapter.

i don’t have a happy death day review online, but i agree with the adjectives above-mentioned. it was one of last year’s surprises, and i genuinely had great fun with it. overall, i would have rated it a b/b+, in case you’re wondering. but let’s get to its sequel and find out if it stood up to the original’s level…  

short answer: no. not even close. honestly, it even diminishes what the first one accomplished. the 2017 original flick was a refreshing surprise because it took a different concept and mixed a bunch of genres in an unexpectedly entertaining way. it was funny, imaginative and jessica rothe proved to be a star in the making. 2u just has rothe. that’s it. its comedy bits only worked a couple of times throughout the whole runtime, and there wasn’t a single scary sequence that didn’t remind me of thousands of other familiar scenes done better in other films.

this movie is simply an easy money-grab, and blumhouse doesn’t mind if it doesn’t stand up to the original as long as it succeeds in the box office, which it already did. unfortunately, that’s how hollywood and the world of cinema works nowadays. if an unique and even risky film, one that was only planned to be a single installment, becomes a box office hit, chances are that a sequel is going to be produced, even if it has to wrongly retcon what happened in the original movie, consequently taking some of its value. this rarely works quality-wise, but i can’t deny that, as a marketing strategy, it’s very profitable for studios.

my main issue with happy death day 2u is that it risks too much with no reasonable payoff. story-wise, it has tons of logical incongruencies, and i don’t buy the ending, at all. christopher landon asks too much of the audience since we have to accept so much nonsense in order to actually enjoy the film. in the original movie, the only thing we needed to “go with” was the actual concept, but that was pretty clear from the get-go. in 2u, there’s a compelling and captivating moral dilemma at its core, but that same dilemma becomes less and less like one by the end of it. it’s still a complicated situation, but it’s like they forgot what was really important and went with other poorly explained route.

it doesn’t matter the genre from which you analyze this film. if you look at it as a comedy, you’ll barely laugh. if you think of it as a scary movie, you’ll never get scared. if you want to be intrigued by who the killer is this time around, you won’t be because the mystery is pretty straightforward. i really don’t want to rant on this film because i do love its cast and i really enjoyed the first movie, but it’s really hard not to be upset since it damages an eventual second viewing of the first one now. when the original installment doesn’t have an open door to other adventures, just don’t try to make a sequel for the sake of it. i know, i know… money. bah.

i don’t want to end this review on a sad note, so i left the brilliant cast to the end. everyone is fantastic, and i hope that at least this film can catapult some of these actors into the spotlight, especially jessica rothe. she has a tremendous range of expressions and incredible ease in changing between emotions. she can look scared, sad and happy in a matter of seconds, with tears and all. she’s a full package. i hope that she can grab either a major role on a big tv series or a supporting role in a blockbuster or oscar-bait movie in the next couple of years. surely, jason blum has some plans for her.

all in all, happy death day 2u does not deserve the box office success that it is having. it’s receiving a lot of credit due to the 2017 original’s surprise hit, and that’s unfair to the first installment. this sequel not only wrongly retcons unnecessary plot details of its predecessor, but it makes that correction its main plot, continuously reminding the audience that we just have to accept it. it’s not as funny, scary, unique or surprisingly entertaining as the original, and if the returning cast didn’t deliver strong performances, this would be one of the worst films of the year. fortunately, there are a couple of good moments here and there, and jessica rothe alone saves the movie from a much more negative review. 

oh, and please, do not make a third one! just leave it alone.

6760,"a fantastic watch, will watch again, and can recommend.

this is a survivalist movie, heavy with philosophy of morality.  a lot of the time when i get to say anything close to that, i get to say, ""but there is humor too"", there is not: not traditional humor anyways.

this is a dark movie filled with metaphor and cruel reality.  now while i am usually offended by reality encroaching on my escapism, that is normally when i'm trying to watch dirt humor.  when to take a concept like this, the relation to reality only strengthens the movie.

""those above, and those below"" is something to think about, and if that intrigues you or you're already onboard for a philosophical discussion of anti-hierarchical class society structure, or intrigue by the idea that it doesn't matter who or when someone is in the class structure: it defeats the society just by being.

6765,"the importance of representation isn't to speak exclusively to one crowd but to demonstrate that deep down, we all deal with the same issues and problems, regardless of ability, race, gender, religion or any of the other attributes that are used to divide us. this movie isn't just about a young boy discovering his identity as a british pakistani muslim, it goes beyond that and depicts a coming of age struggle between parent and child. 

springsteen's soundtrack works as a baseline around javid's transition from boy to man, through the pursuit of him achieving his dream, which beautifully represents mid 80's britain as this bleak and hopeless space that is being held together with prayers and dreams of better tomorrows. 

my favourite part is the moment springsteen's music is introduced, mirroring a similar reaction to mine, at a similar age to an unknown band, the airborne toxic event, who were also greatly inspired by the boss. <span style=""background-color: black""> lyrics flash on screen while a storm brews outside, energy radiates from the screen while i'm on fire rings in your ears. </span> the magic of cinema never felt more alive to me than it did in those few brief minutes.

the final 30 minutes of the movie had me physically crying, an honour held by a select few, the most touching aspects were in relation to the cultural heritage of the characters and felt very close to home.

i went to this movie not expecting much, but it never crossed my mind that i would be watching a film as bad or worse than the nun. honestly, going back, i was too easy on the latter since i didn’t exactly give it a massively negative review, which it surely deserves. however, annabelle comes home really tries its best to be even worse. i hate it. i truly do. the horror genre has been exponentially growing, and it’s one of the two most popular genres right now (comic-book movies are the other), but this cheap, bland, cliche, predictable, and forgettable class of horror films is genuinely starting to annoy and frustrate me. the conjuring universe became just a set of silly spin-offs with entities that have no interest whatsoever and filled with extremely under-developed characters.

this is the third movie about annabelle. three films that address the powers of a freaking doll. three! very few people liked the first one, the prequel was admittedly a pleasant surprise, but this one is just atrociously bad. there’s not even a story. the whole movie is based on repeating almost laughable jump scares sequences. literally, it’s all some sort of variation of the following:

character walks down the hall -> a strange noise occurs-> character slowly follows that noise -> score starts to become louder -> character checks something and camera closes in on the actor’s face -> score becomes heavier and louder with the introduction of bass -> another noise occurs behind the character -> camera pans with the character and nothing happens -> character continues to check on something -> another noise, another pan, nothing again -> score is reaching its climax -> character continues doing the same thing -> final noise, pan, and then one out of the two predictable jump scares happen: boo! or fake! … boo! -> these are accompanied by a ridiculously loud sound that everyone in the theater is already bracing for because, guess what, everyone knows it’s coming -> cut -> repeat.

except for the first 15-20 minutes, which are used to solely provide backstory to the three main characters, every single scene is an uninspired, unimaginative, anticipated, and tedious build-up to a jump scare that heavily relies on an exaggeratedly loud sound, and someone screaming. there’s no real narrative besides some character backstories which also have their own issues, especially one that involves an attempt at the start of a silly romance. gary dauberman tried to insert comedy in order to balance an otherwise monotonous film, but he failed miserably. every supposedly funny moment is astonishingly cringe-worthy. it was his directorial feature-debut, and it shows.

it just feels like another cheap horror flick, filled with nothing but jump scares. one after the other. every director in hollywood could have done this, there’s no distinct style or a trademark shot. nothing. i do believe that every movie takes a lot of work, and there are tons of people behind a film that genuinely give it their all every time. but annabelle comes home feels so much like a pure cash grab, and i hate writing these words because every movie ever is ultimately an attempt to win money for the studios. however, this sequel never feels like it’s actually serving any purpose for the expansion or improvement of the universe it represents. it’s a horror flick filmed in just one location, something that i usually love because you can do so much with it, but this time it really seems that it was filmed entirely at a house because it was cheaper, hence more probability of profit.

there are two clear areas in the horror genre: the zone with films like hereditary, get out and us, where the story and its characters are what’s more important and scarier; and the other with movies like the nun, the curse of la llorona or annabelle comes home, where the only goal is to cyclically produce jump scare sequences with no narrative significance or impact. if you enjoy this latter type of films (which is absolutely okay, everything is subjective to personal preferences), then you’ll probably enjoy this movie. at least, people in my theater screamed and laughed pretty hard with no respect for the moviegoers that were trying to watch the actual film. however, if you’re sick of watching the same thing over and over and over and over again, please, for your own sake, skip it.

if it wasn’t for the truly amazing performances, this could very easily be the worst movie of the year (serenity still holds that spot). mckenna grace is phenomenal as judy! madison iseman and katie sarife are also pretty good at their roles. patrick wilson and vera farmiga barely have any screentime, but when they do show up, they definitely elevate the scene. everything related to the production design is quite good, but technicalities will never save a film from misery if the two pillars of any movie (story and characters) are thrown down the sewer. also, i was shocked when i discovered that this is rated r. there’s barely any blood or anything that justifies that type of rating. it’s another aspect that makes this film an even bigger disappointment.

in the end, annabelle comes home is as poor or worse than the nun. i can’t really decide which one i would watch instead of the other because i truly don’t want to watch any of these ever again. a brilliant cast might save this movie from a completely negative review, but it’s still an atrociously cheap addition to the horror genre. everyone knows why this film doesn’t work: continuously repeating predictable, loud, and hollow jump scare sequences is not a story. i can’t feel invested in any of these scenes if they lack narrative impact or a minimum level of scariness. the fact that i barely even instinctively flinched (something i can’t really avoid) is a sign of how horrible this movie is. my expectations for the conjuring 3 just dropped tremendously. good luck, james wan. you’re going to need it.

set in florida during a category 5 hurricane, crawl tells the story of haley and her father dave, played by barry pepper. after receiving a frantic phone call from her sister, haley goes on the hunt to find her father who is trapped in their old house as the hurricane approaches. 

unbeknownst to haley, the overflow drain has been breached by alligators, and their about to make haley’s rescue mission a whole lot more difficult.

and if the gators don’t get haley and her dad, the rising hurricane waters will.

i don’t know much about alligators or hurricanes, but i do like to think i know something about logic. and that is something that is sorely lacking in most characters in this film. even the dog.

a series of unfortunate events conspire to make the rescue almost a futile effort. and the missing logic from our characters only add to the frustration to us, as the viewer. 

where should i start? first and foremost, i want to understand why neither haley or dave ever tried to smash out the weak looking brick work patterns on the basement wall and then crawl out of the new hole to safety? it doesn’t look like the bricks would need much in the way of a good whack to break open – and considering there were tools in the basement, including the shovel that dave uses later on to half-decapitate a gator, this bit makes no sense to me. now i realise two things – 1 is that the open brick patterns serves a purpose to flood the basement – but in reality it’s the first thing anyone would think to smash open. and 2 – if they did do that, then i realise we’d have a short film. but then the writers could have had more fun for the next hour putting haley and dave in more incredible and hard to survive scenarios. so there’s a missed opportunity.

the gators that are stuck into basement with haley and dave also don’t seem to be those of the killing variety – its either that or the skin of our two characters is so tough that these gators just can’t bite through them. i’m not gator expert, but i am pretty sure if one gets his whole mouth on your arm – he is probably going to bite your whole arm off, and not just leave a minor bite mark. funny thing is we know these two gators are indeed killers, as one of them does eat the police man who comes to rescue them. 

also following up on the theme of me not being an expert on gators – one thing has me puzzled. do gators kill for sport, or because they’re hungry? i can’t work that out based on this movie. 

and in something that really shocked me for an american movie – it took over an hour until we saw the first gun. that has to be some kind of record for an american horror thriller movie?

but its not all bad – because there are quite a few laugh out loud moments in this movie to lighten up the mood.

i really liked the way haley traps one of the gators in the shower. that’s both clever and utterly ridiculous – that a flimsy piece of shower glass could be strong enough to hold back a gator that wants to kill.

i also liked the nod to the purge movies when the siren started just as the eye of the storm was passing through. it almost felt like a both a warning to all humans, and a sign to all gators that they could begin their hunt.

if you go into this movie realising that its not meant to be taken seriously, then its an enjoyable ride that will only briefly have you jumping in your seat over the scares and light gore. for a movie about gators hunting humans, it is surprisingly light on the gore – but then that’s what happens when hollywood makes horror movies for teen audiences.

and there in lies the problem with this movie and someone like me watching it. it not aimed or marketed at me, and maybe not even at you. it’s a forgettable popcorn flick in the same vein as bait, but not as fun – at least that had gore to go with its killer sharks.",low
6777,"the movie plot follows hayle, who heads towards a storm in florida to check on his father, who is not answering calls.

when she gets there, her father is hurt and the house is surrounded by hungry and furious alligators. to make it worse, the storm causes a flooding and all this water just makes the hunt easier for the gators.

the movie has good visual effects, but the plot armor is the most absurd one i have seen in years. against everybody else, the gators are relentless and super-effective man-killing machines, tearing anyone in pieces before they are even able to see what is attacking them. the protagonists, however, suffer only mild scratches from gator bites that would at least result in an arm or leg being torn off. 

this is so frequent and so clearly absurd and unrealistic that the movie ceases to be enjoyable after a while.",low
6783,"pretty pointless movie. signed up to review because i couldn't believe the rating this received. yes, you get a weird realtor and a creepy kid but other than that you just watch the couple basically repeat each day hating being stuck. you're not going to learn anything more about the weird freaks or why they're doing what they're doing and will end up feeling like you just wasted your time. yeah, i get it's supposed to be satire but pass.",low
6785,"amazing watch, will watch again, and can recommend.

imogen poots and jesse eisenberg (both from ""the art of self defense"") are amazing in their roles as an abducted couple force to raise a child.

this is an amazing premise (see ""solar opposites"" for something similar), and one that is extremely hard to discuss without spoilers. this is a wonderful mix of tropes. there is a prisoner / abductee trope, there is ""adoption of a strange child"" trope, there is a ""troubled couple"" trope, there is even a mystery trope.

i'm fully of the opinion that the right thing to do in any abduction situation is to not reward the criminals with what they want because there is no reason that while they have all the power that they're going to do anything to benefit the victims. we get see an exploration of what people do in a dire situation and given a task, similar to a couple different ""twilight zone"" episodes.

the production value is clearly here, and while they appear to have saved some money on limited locations, it clearly put to good use as the movie delves deeper into its story.

i can't recommend this enough, please give it a shot all the way through.",high
6787,"it's a movie whose premise had promise but was never thoroughly explored.

i read the generally high praise in the reviews for this movie and admittedly, i was fooled. i'm convinced that at least the individual here who likened part of its premise to the animated series, ""solar opposites,"" while not being entirely off the mark, neglected to mention that unlike solar opposites, there is no payoff with vivarium. unlike solar opposites, we don't know why vivarium exists. we don't know why people are expected to raise these mysterious hominids. we don't know what their purpose is, other than to entrap first home buyers, like some kind of otherworldly predatory lender. is it a euphemism for unscrupulous property developers? who knows?

only thing i know is that by the end of it all, i felt totally ripped off. at around 90 minutes, it was 60 minutes too long. it's not even something that i can suggest is open to much interpretation.

if you just need something playing in the background while you're performing other work at home, even then it may be a stretch but it certainly doesn't deserve much better.",low
6791,"i really wanted to give this film five stars, but there is a curious introspection that prevents me from calling it perfection. nevertheless, ‘1917’ is a brilliant piece of art, and clearly a personal project for sam mendes. blending groundbreaking technology with detailed production components, it's sure to entertain audiences and garner respect from critics for its execution. just don’t say i didn’t warn you when the oscar nominations come out.

https://www.msbreviews.com

let me just take a deep breath... wait, one more... uff, i have no idea how i survived this imax screening of 1917. usually, i don't delve deep into technical stuff since most people don't know or don't care about these attributes, but it's impossible not to address roger deakins' cinematography. it's not the first time a film has been edited to appear as ""one shot"" (a continuous take), but it never fails to impress me.

alejandro g. iñárritu's birdman, silent house starring elizabeth olsen, or the famous rope from the one and only alfred hitchcock... all produce the same trick. even mr. robot and the haunting of hill house have brought us two phenomenal ""one shot"" episodes, edited as well with the so-called ""stitches,"" meaning that the actual cuts are made to look invisible to the viewer, hence giving that feeling that it's all just one continuous take. cuts are often applied when a random character is passing in front of the camera; when the latter ""pans"" (movement similar to a head-turn) over a wall or an object that occupies the whole screen; or when the characters are simply going through a dark area.

sam mendes, roger deakins, and lee smith (editor) all work together to deliver the most immersive war movie (probably) ever. yes, it has a simple premise, and the main narrative is basic, but the remarkable technical achievement elevates this film so freaking much. even if you don't know the slightest thing about filmmaking or how movies are made, it's impossible to watch this film and not think ""something feels different about this one."" this is a movie meant to be watched at the biggest, best screen possible. watching 1917 at home on a tv or a laptop is not going to work at all.

throughout the whole runtime, i felt like i was there with schofield and blake. it feels like we are a third soldier going with them on a vital mission to save thousands of lives. i believe 1917 is the best ""one shot"" film to date (i've been using the quote signs for a reason, don't mistake it for an actual one shot movie), with birdman as a close second. if the latter deals with a lot more dialogue and acting, the former has dozens of nail-biting sequences featuring shootouts, explosions, and a lot of running/walking/swimming through mud, dead corpses, blood, and way too many nasty rats.

i really have no words to describe roger deakins' cinematography. it's not merely a film, it's a whole experience. it's not just another cool technical achievement. it's the entire foundation of 1917, and the main reason why so many people are rushing to the theater. however, a lot of people are completely ignoring lee smith's work. don't forget, this isn't an actual one shot movie. if it's been edited to look like one continuous take, and if it actually does appear to be a single take, then the editor should get as much recognition as everyone else. yes, he doesn't have to work with thousands of cuts (i counted 14, but i'm sure there's more), but they still exist, and he has to make sure no one feels them. and he did so perfectly.

my last paragraph concerning the technical aspects has to go to sam mendes and thomas newman. as the director, mendes is able to deliver precisely what he envisioned and seamlessly coordinate his actors. not only has he directed my favorite bond film (skyfall), but he also offers one of my favorite war movies of all-time. as for newman, i just wish that joker had been released in another year because 1917's score is fantastic. hildur guðnadóttir is likely taking the oscar for best original score, but if thomas newman takes it, i'll still be delighted.

a lot of comparisons are being made with christopher nolan's dunkirk. they're similar films regarding the fact that their main goal is to provide the most immersive war experience. story and character-wise, both movies don't really develop that much. nolan's film is loved by most critics and audiences all around the world, but one common complaint about it is the lack of character building. i didn't mind that at all because the movie never actually tried to make their characters important. they were just soldiers caught in the worst of situations, similar to 1917. however, i do think the latter does a better job of making us care for the protagonists.

george mackay and dean-charles chapman's characters have small arcs, but they exist. in the beginning, blake is the emotional-driven character, while schofield seems to be the rational one. we, as the audience, care about the mission first, but as time goes by, we learn about their personal traits and motivations. by the end of the film, i was crying. both play off of each other really well, but it's their dialogue that impresses me the most. what seems to be just a random talk while strolling through an open field of grass, it truly isn't. if it's not meaningful at the time, it's going to be. the acting is more physical than anything, and both deliver outstanding performances.

i would say i love 1917 as much as i love dunkirk. i might be tempted to choose the former due to the ""recency effect,"" but there's one small aspect that negatively affects both. their replay value is not as high as other films since their technical achievements don't work as well on a regular tv in the comfort of our own home. you will never feel or understand that ""immersive experience"" that everyone talks about. you won't know what made people to be blown away. you won't love it as much as everyone else. so, please, do not miss 1917 in theaters!

sam mendes, roger deakins, and lee smith. director, director of photography, editor. three key filmmaking roles in the creation of one of the best wwi movies of all-time. edited to look like one continuous shot, 1917 is a mind-blowing technical achievement, elevated by deakins' always jaw-dropping cinematography, thomas newman emotionally powerful score, mendes impeccable directing, and smith's seamless editing. george mackay and dean-charles chapman deliver outstanding (physical) performances, but it's the astonishing filmmaking that steals the spotlight. production design, costume design, sound, you name it. everything is absolutely perfect. it's meant to be seen at the biggest screen near you since this is an incredibly immersive experience that you won't get at home. it's going straight into my top10: best movies of 2019, and i hope you'll love it as much as i do.

rating: a",high
6797,"very well made war-drama all in a one-shot like format. performance from george mackay who i guess if nothing else could follow in the footsteps of tom cruise for his all-out running ability. joking aside, really enjoyed this film which manages to provide enough character development for me to care about his well being and task. probably my favorite of 2019. **4.5/5**",high
6799,"i see that a lot is made of the technique they use to film this movie in one continuous shot, and it is very interesting, but i must confess i am not a student of film, merely a viewer. so you will find no critiques of the director or editor or that sort of technical detail. i like what i like.

anyway, i enjoyed this movie more than i expected i would. i am not big on war movies. the scenery seemed great to me, and though there were visually stunning scenes, they didn't try to pile on explosion after explosion to cater to that crowd. the two leads were at the same time heroes and regular guys. i could almost picture myself in their position. moments of extreme courage and bravery under fire were balanced by totally justified panic and fear. there were also quieter moments here and there, breaks from the sometimes hard to bear tension. finally, there was a plot twist that seems normal looking back at it, but it shocked me at the time. i will leave it at that and not risk giving anything away.

so while i probably won't watch it again anytime soon, i do recommend it, even to viewers like me, who aren't big on war movies. as a side note, one viewer warned others not to compare this movie to saving private ryan. i guess he thought it doesn't compare with it. maybe i should give that movie a second look.",high
6803,"beautifully shot. music was superb. premise interesting. acting was good.

but i've never yelled at a characters complete incompetence as much as i did this one. the schofield dolt just stumbles around in a stupor the whole time doing just about everything he can wrong and it's basically sheer luck more people didn't die because of this nitwit.  schofield is annoying at first and over time he grows to real irritation.

i can't express my true rage at this moron as the review would either be removed or filled with [explicative deleted] notations. 

as beautiful as the camera work and music is in this film, it's not nearly good enough to bump this rating any higher for the rage that it caused in me for this character. yet the cinematography and music were too good to let me give it the lowest rating.

it's a well done movie about a complete [explicative deleted].",low
6805,"1917 is on the of the best war films in cinema history.

the plot is very basic, but the script is so strong that the it really does not matter. it is a individual journey of our two characters with the focus on perseverance rather than large scale war spectacles. it is very intimate, which sets itself apart from other films in the genre.

the acting was incredible. our two leads, george mackay and dean-charles chapman, have such amazing chemistry with a vast amount of emotional range. it had me verging on tears on more than one occasion. the cinematography was masterful. sam mendes is completely mental for shooting this film as a one take. i can not even imagine the pain staking process of shooting each scene to seamless transition into the next, it was spectacular. the scope is so large that it seems like it should have been an impossible task. the score is fantastic and blends itself nicely with the film.

overall, this one of the best films i have seen in a long time. it was super impressive on all front and will go down as simply a masterpiece.

6807,the best lgbt movie ever. and that's on period luv.,high
6808,"céline sciamma, writer and director of “portrait of a lady on fire,” calls her period film a “manifesto on the male gaze.” this is the most accurate, elegant description of her story of a romance between two french women in the late 1700s. this is an impeccably detailed, beautifully acted, refined drama with a strong feminist angle that’s as stirring as it is thought-provoking.

marianne (noémie merlant) is commissioned to paint the wedding portrait of héloïse (adèle haenel), a young woman who has just left the convent. because héloïse is a very reluctant bride-to-be, marianne arrives under the guise of companionship, observing the smallest of details about the woman by day and secretly painting her by firelight at night. as the two women spend their days with one another, intimacy and attraction grow, and the portrait becomes a symbol of the intensity of their love.

the lead performances are mannered and structured in the most effective way. the strong desire between the two women is manifested in a gaze or careful examination of a wisp of hair or the way héloïse crosses her hands. there’s a quiet intensity to the emotional and physical intimacy between these two women, making this love story’s end feel all the more heartbreaking.

this is mostly an all-female film, and the men briefly seen on screen play little importance. rounding out the characters are héloïse’s mother (valeria golino) and housekeeper sophie (luàna bajrami), who both fill critical roles in the story as the film explores issues affecting women at the time, including arranged marriages, career expectations, and health concerns.

the film itself is absolutely stunning, with gorgeously romantic and lush cinematography by claire mathon setting a sensual tone that complements the story. the artistry is outstanding, making “portrait of a lady on fire” one of the most powerful, intellectual dramas of the year.",high

celine sciamma’s fourth feature film, _portrait of a lady on fire_, is a triumph. few romance movies capture the totality of love, loss, and remembrance in the way sciamma does in this film. the story is simple: marianne (noémie merlant) has been hired to paint a portrait of heloise (adèle haenel) to be sent to the milanese nobleman she is to marry. he will not marry her until he sees what she looks like. other artists have tried and failed to paint heloise, but she has resisted because she doesn’t want to be married. marianne pretends to be heloise’s walking companion, all the while studying heloise so she can paint her in secret. eventually, though, marianne’s secret is revealed and heloise agrees to sit for her.",high
6813,"i will freely admit to being a fairly easy grader when it comes to sci-if movies and romantic comedies. if the dialogue is realistic and sharp and the plot doesn’t insult my intelligence, i am in.

i enjoyed last christmas on that basis and because of what i saw as a good group of actors. the script was co-written by emma thompson and her spouse, greg wise (willoughby in sense and sensibility, also written by thompson. hmm.) i found kate’s character development from being a rather selfish slacker to a decent person fairly believable as it was tackled gradually and partly based on events happening all around her, not just on her developing feelings for bike-riding tom. 

the yugoslav family history and cultural influences felt odd and somehow not related to the plot until the midpoint or so of the movie, where it gradually began to feel like a relevant side plot to the story. i must say that i saw the climactic plot twist revelation coming a mile away, but i do   write novels in my spare time, so i tend to wonder about where a story is going rather than merely enjoying having it wash over me like i should.

this movie may not become annual holiday viewing for me, but i will definitely watch it again next christmas and give it at least a shot of becoming a seasonal viewing ritual.",high
6821,"'waves', while certainly ambitious, is so busy trying to be a future indie classic with its camera acrobatics and needle drops that it forgets to give any impetus to care about the supposedly profound stories it's trying to tell, instead coasting on its stylistic flairs and hoping these will distract from how shallow its writing is, making the 135-minute run time incredibly laborious. by his own admission, shults modelled his film on the two-part structure of frank ocean's 'blonde', an album which is featured prominently in the film. what audiences get instead is the cinematic equivalent of putting the album on while having a cry in the shower, a deep dive into misery porn, yet 'waves' is a far less rewarding experience than just doing the real thing yourself.

6846,"**not what it appears to be... i really did not-see this coming...**

this is one of those horror movies that is actually really deep and symbolical and works on multiple levels and has multiple stories hidden within the surface narrative and in this case it's actually 3 stories that are told at the same time, though only the surface narrative is picked up consciously, the other 2 are picked up subconsciously and that's what makes it disturbing.

be sure to watch the extended cut, because only there does it really become apparent what the other 2 stories are about. so, here go the spoilers, cause now i am gonna say what i believe those 3 themes are. obviously on the surface it's a horror movie, but beneath that it's a drama about relationships and about breaking up - some people pick up on that first hidden theme/narrative and so they find it boring because they expected a horror movie, but what they get is an emotional drama.

but no one has consciously picked up on the 3rd narrative - or at least i have never seen anyone mention it - even though it's very obvious when you watch the extended cut. the third genre of movies is that it's a movie about the 3rd reich and related national socialist propaganda, ideology and atrocities committed and that's the aspect everyone only picks up subconsciously and that makes everyone feel uncomfortable watching this movie, but without really knowing why.

which also explains some of the criticism, such as swedes and pagans complaining that their culture and ideology isn't portrayed accurately. of course it isn't, because that's not the culture or ideology it's trying to portray! so the 4th and ultimate genre is that it's really a biting political satire that uses all the other genres as cover.

it's like the travel movies that the soviet union published that make the soviet union look like some kind of socialist disneyland. and as long as you were a tourist who was willing to only go to the places he was told to go and to just gloss over all the labor camps and atrocities, it kinda was! and so what those movies were for socialism, this movie is for national socialism - a sorta satirical video travel guide into a promised national socialist fantasy land and utopian paradise that never existed and that only a complete psychopath could ever try to propagate as something desirable.",high
6847,"**it starts with good premises, but is lost due to a miserable script and a direction that needs direction.**

ari aster is not a director that i consider good. this is his second feature film, and he didn't show great talent for directing here. however, worse than his direction is his absolute lack of writing skills: the script he wrote here is mediocre, to be nice, and completely kills the film.

what i liked most about this film was the extraordinary cinematography, full of color and light and joy that makes us feel the warmth and natural vibrancy of the beginning of summer. by largely setting his film in a rural ambience, aster was almost able to demonize urban life, portraying urban environments as gloomy, dark, sinister and depressing. in fact, he even creates a link between the main character's agony and the depressive environments of urban life: there is not a sole positive or warm image before the characters set foot on the fields of sweden... or rather hungary, the country where most of the filming took place, perhaps taking advantage of the tax benefits that were given to foreign film productions there.

the sets and costumes could not be more appealing, especially to audiences who are already interested in nordic traditions, witchcraft, wicca or new age paganism: we have runes, we have hippie-style flowers in their hair, we have people in white and barefoot dancing around poles, we have fertile and sexually desirable youngsters, we have the recreational and ritualistic consumption of drugs and hallucinogens, we have happy people living in a community, with no private property and in polyamory... it seems like a john lennon dream. this is beautiful, attractive and seductive in the same way that it is unbelievable and contradicts the basic human instincts: the appetite for violence and the desire to have things. unfortunately, and largely due to a poorly written script, the film is no more than that. the director/screenwriter was unable to give the film a conclusion or create a credible threat. clearly inspired by another film (“the wicker man”), it lacks a good ending, there are too many stupid scenes (for example, when one of the characters cries heartlessly and is surrounded by a choir that almost turns it into a song) and there are too many loose ends in this story, which becomes more and more idiotic. to make everything more ignoble, there is a subliminal anti-christian message that becomes clear when we see that the most vilified character is named christian...

the actors are not to blame for the misery that this film was. florence pugh is the actress who stands out the most and does the most interesting work, but vilhelm blomgren also offers us a well-done performance. will poulter, one of the actors i know best here, seems underutilized, with a character that only appears occasionally and is irrelevant to the plot. william harper also does what he can, but he doesn't have the space or material to show what he's worth. in the european cast, isabelle grill and gunnel fred are the actresses who deserve the most attention: each of them, in their own way, tried to be mysterious and unsettling, and they achieved this in the way they had imagined.",low

knives out has been shown in numerous festivals, and it received massive acclaim in literally every single one of them. therefore, its hype grew more and more until its wide release date. before the film, i can’t deny that i was indeed affected by the whole “a whodunnit like you haven’t seen in years.” i went into the theater with high expectations, not only due to the festival praise but due to its jaw-dropping cast. it’s uncommon to possess such a renowned ensemble and deliver a “bad” movie, especially when rian johnson is writing and directing it (yes, i like the last jedi, and even if i didn’t, he did other stuff, you know?). it’s one of those films everyone knows it’s going to be appreciated by a considerable part of the world.

even the genre itself is a very welcome type of cinema entertainment in regards to both critics and the general public. so, does it live up to its hype, or it fails to reach such high expectations? knives out is one of the best movies of the year, as well as one of the best mystery-suspense stories of the millennium (everyone is doing the whole “best x of the decade,” i’m going one step beyond). this is a film i know i’m going to rewatch countless times throughout the next years. usually, when it comes to whodunnits, people are misled into thinking that from the moment they know who “did it,” the movie loses its interest. this is rarely true, and rian johnson succeeds because he doesn’t need the ultimate reveal to deliver a great story.

this screenplay is definitely getting tons of nominations and wins during the awards season. every little line of dialogue means something. every single character says or does something impactful to the narrative (except for jaeden martell’s). it’s been half-a-day since i’ve seen it, and for every question that my brain comes up with, there’s an answer lying on someone’s words or actions. it’s such an intricate, complex, extremely subtle script. one with so many tiny, little details that it’s impossible to catch them all on a first viewing.

i genuinely love the first act, even if it’s the one where i have a minor issue. rian johnson doesn’t waste time and puts us directly in the crime scene, interviewing each and every member of the family. it’s through these interrogatories that he cleverly introduces the suspects, developing them solely through masterfully written dialogue, and outstanding performances. for example, with a single sentence and a particular body/face expression, toni collette instantly creates a profile of joni, her character. rian plays with character-types and cliches in such an intelligent manner. he makes us think a particular character follows a specific cliche, then it doesn’t, then it does again…

that’s one of the reasons i couldn’t figure out the mystery until the last act reveal. every time i was close to indeed follow the right path, new developments arise, meant to mislead, confuse, and create doubts. some people feel better with themselves if they solve the case before the film. they feel “intellectually superior” just because they found out before everyone else. first of all, i prefer being fooled and end up blown away by an unexpected conclusion than solving the whole thing way before time’s up and end up disappointed and bored. then, honestly, anyone who says, “i guessed it,” there’s a 99% chance that they’re either lying or not answering correctly to the question “who killed harlan?” if you’ve seen the movie, you’ll understand what i’m trying to express.

(i don’t want to sound presumptuous or hypocritical. i’m not trying to say, “i couldn’t figure it out, so no one can.” please, if you haven’t seen the film, judge the previous paragraph after your viewing.)

throughout the second and third acts, loose ends start to tie up, ending up with a brilliantly delivered reveal. from the marvelous cinematography (with those classic close-ups when a character is about to say something meaningful or tell a story through their imagination or memory) to the remarkable editing, the team behind rian johnson did a phenomenal job. the suspense is held at high levels, and it reaches limit-breaking points with marta cabrera’s (ana de armas) narrative. armas and daniel craig deliver the standout performances, with chris evans (ransom) following right behind. literally, everyone else offers excellent displays, and help carry a story filled with mystery, but also with a lot of humor.

however, i have to emphasize how astonishing ana de armas and daniel craig are. ana might be a bit unknown to most people. i’ve been supporting her ever since blade runner 2049, so i’m ecstatic that she finally got a major role in a big movie, especially within an ensemble of actors with legendary careers. craig, who could have just delivered a slight variation of the character he’s been playing for years, instead offers a unique take on the detective role. just like evans, both have been playing iconic characters for years, so it’s sort of an extra joke to everyone who watched captain america and james bond for the past decade or so.

my only minor issue has nothing to do with the political undertone and the social messages rian johnson puts in this film. honestly, i love that aspect of it. it’s like rian knew some people would complain about it, so he made sure to have a couple of characters (jaeden martell’s jacob and katherine langford’s meg) somewhat resembling the so-called snowflakes and all that. no, my issue is related to some excessive exposition regarding the first act’s interrogatories. it’s great that every character gets their own motivations, but it feels like each confrontation with the detectives went on for a bit too long. some pieces of the mystery might be a bit hard to believe that they would occur, but these are all nitpicks in a remarkable movie.

in the end, rian johnson is able to bounce back from the divisive the last jedi with one of the best whodunnits i’ve ever seen, knives out. rian proves that not only he’s a talented filmmaker but also a phenomenal screenwriter. with a renowned and impressive ensemble cast, daniel craig and ana de armas are standouts within all of the other outstanding performances, chris evans being right behind. with one of the best screenplays of the year, the mystery at its center keeps everyone extremely captivated until the very end, even if you guess “who did it” beforehand. masterfully written dialogue, remarkable editing, and great use of classic cinematography techniques. it’s an entertaining story with tremendous replay value and significant political/social layers that only elevate the already complex yet subtle narrative. don’t miss it!

6852,"""that certainly not what i was expecting.""

- whodunit?
- rian johnson.
- why?
- to subvert the tropes of yet another sub-genre... properly!

as divisive as it was, i neither loved nor hated the love-it-or-hate-it the last jedi. maybe because i'm not a huge fan of the much-beloved saga. but i can give you a quick opinion of what i thought about it anyway. the first half almost turned me off completely: tons of lame jokes and out-of-character moments that indicate that johnson's biggest concern was to subvert expectations and nothing but. the second half of the film was way better. it proved to me that johnson is actually very capable of adding fresh blood to the saga, so effortlessly to such an extent that i wondered why he struggled so much in the first half.

in knives out, johnson didn't add a new spin on the 'whodunit' sub-genre of detective fiction; he took it and turned it on its head. he did so not only by playing with the tropes and mechanisms of this sub-genre -and boy, he did that so exquisitely and gracefully- but he also by using a new and very effective building block: drama. it doesn't sound new, isn't it? but, actually, relying on it here, in this kind of a story, is nothing short of revolutionary, and that's simply lies in the fact it's unprecedented to build upon it here. the result is nothing but marvellous. and although that, at some point, the main concern of the plot wasn't the murder mystery per se, the mystery didn't lose its sharpness even a tiny bit. and that's a strong proof that everything worked, and integrated, seamlessly. i said integrated because the film has a plethora of comedic bits throughout its runtime -which flies by- and, to be honest, i think every single joke landed perfectly. the film also suggest a political agenda that's exquisitely woven into the plot, and provides a sharp social commentary that's impressively subtle.

not only did rian johnson reinvigorate this seemingly outmoded and unfruitful sub-genre, but he also did the same thing with a couple of members of the star-studded cast: i didn't know that chris evans, captain america himself, would be better as, well, an ""anti-captain america ""; craig as blanc is absolutely phenomenal, with his southern accent and caricature detective character; and jaeden martell (it) is very interesting as the weirdo jacob thrombey. as for curtis, langford, plummer, collette and shannon, johnson makes an excellent use of their incredible acting abilities, and of their facial expressions and features, especially shannon with his remarkable menacing countenance. the real standout, though, is ana de armas. i mean, she was good in blade runner 2049, but here, as she plays my new favourite version of pinocchio, she proves she's an exceptionally talented actress who is capable of expressing emotions, and changing them readily, only with her eyes. honestly, i think she should have been nominated for an oscar!

overall, i'm really surprised how much i loved this film. with johnson superb and clever direction and meticulously-nuanced and witty -albeit slightly too-structured- screenplay, i think this is my favourite - even if it's not my highest-rated - film of 2019. you know what, this film is actually terrible: it's very pretentious; its puzzle is too convoluted for its own good; it has an overabundance of plot twists; it underutilized its stellar ensemble; and it has a lot of plot holes, or -in this case- donut holes! excuse me, i gotta leave right now!

even on just one watch, it's one of my favourites already - i have a feeling i'll be revisiting this a lot. i had heard amazing things about this since its release and, man, is the hype befitting. it's a brilliant 131 minutes, even if it feels much shorter than that given how enjoyable it is.

the casting is impeccable. daniel craig is superb in the role of blanc, i've actually found craig a tad hit-and-miss - even with <em>'james bond'</em> - but he is utterly superb here; even with that unusual yet definitely entertaining accent.

it's by no means the craig show, though. ana de armas is excellent as marta, she does a lot of heavy lifting in terms of making her character's situation fully believable. she's great from start-to-finish.

michael shannon is top notch too, i literally always find him fun to watch - from <em>'boardwalk empire'</em> to, even, <em>'kangaroo jack'</em>. jamie lee curtis, chris evans, don johnson, toni collette, lakeith stanfield and christopher plummer are all fantastic too.

the plot is enthralling, it's crafted together expertly. it reveals bits way earlier than i was predicting, which made me worry it was going to all fall flat at any moment but it kept turning out to be the perfect time to twist the story. the comedy is also very funny, i laughed a fair amount.

""the bad scores are conservative trolls"" and once again we see people, and johnson, attacking anyone that doesn't like this film.

once again people are throwing a fit because other people don't like the exact same thing they do.

but to be honest, again, i can see that. this is overtly political, and by ""overtly"" i mean that they are screaming through a megaphone, at just about every opportunity, to inject their politics into it.

other than that, it is kind of like clue... if clue was very careful not to insult some people in their jokes, and very focused in an attempt to insult others with a sheer and unadulterated prejudice. and that kind of makes for a very awkward film where the jokes are so self-aware they can't help but fail.

so, basically that is what you are getting, clue with jokes aimed at the politically correct and a hearty injection of politics. and that is all you are getting.

first of all, no, i have no knowledge of the tv series this film is based upon, and after watching jeff wadlow's adaptation, i'm definitely not watching anything related to this story. i always follow this principle: the two pillars of any movie are its story and characters. it doesn't matter if everything else is absolutely perfect. if the two central pieces fail to convince the audience, then the whole movie falls to the ground. sometimes, there are some crumbles that remain intact. very rarely, there's a big segment that has no scratches whatsoever, which can help the film to survive and, even more rarely, actually make it ""okay"".

fantasy island has two little crumbles named portia doubleday (sloane) and maggie q (gwen), who deliver good performances, especially the former who everyone knows from one of the best tv shows of all-time, mr. robot. everything else is completely destroyed. the grudge still has a couple of redeeming moments, but fantasy island is undoubtedly the worst movie of the year, so far. the before-mentioned two pillars are built with the most annoying, cliche characters, as well as a ridiculous narrative that ultimately brings the whole thing down.

the third act possesses some of the most nonsensical, irrational, and illogical plot twists i've ever witnessed. this is 2020's version of serenity, also a movie with an absurd twist that only turns the film even worse than what it was. the big difference between the two plot twists is that serenity's was predictable from the get-go. fantasy island's last twenty minutes are profoundly unexpected because no sane soul would have thought of such a baffling narrative decision.

the best way to describe the twist without spoiling a thing (and i won't) is through the editing. during the exposition-heavy revelation, the editing is so awkwardly choppy that it made me think it was all fake. i genuinely thought the plot twist was a false sequence. when i realized it wasn't, i simply laughed like a maniac because i couldn't believe someone thought this made logical sense. usually, a plot twist carries some sort of build-up, even if it's literally a couple of minutes before the explicit revelation.

this one just happens. without any preparation, a character just shows up on the screen and begins explaining everything. it simply doesn't make any logical sense. it generates so many incongruencies with the whole story that i lost count of the plot holes i was able to point out. the film starts with establishing a few rules, only for an hour later to ignore or change them completely. a particular character acts a certain way without any plausible reason as to why. if the screenplay wasn't messy and confusing enough, the characters are also horribly-written.

i never enjoy writing that an actor failed to do its job, but ryan hansen (jd weaver) is the weak link of the cast, even if every single script is dreadful. even the casting doesn't make sense: michael peña as a dramatic mr. roarke? a character supposed to be serious and mysterious? it's michael peña! i don't want to insinuate that he can only do comedy, but making him the villain (if i can call him that) is another addition to the list of questionable production decisions. lucy hale (melanie) is fine as the protagonist, but it all comes down to the lazy, unimaginative scripts. everything is so unbelievably messy that i don't even have any sort of technical remarks... maybe that the beginning of the film and the actual concept look interesting. that's the only compliment i can think of: it wasn't a bad idea (different fantasies, different genres, it could have been a fun mix of styles).

fantasy island is undoubtedly the worst film of the year until now. consider it 2020's version of last year's serenity, but with a third act's plot twist that is so unexpected, everyone will have their jaws on the floor due to how nonsensical it is. the story wasn't close to being decent until the revelation, and it only turned into something a lot worse after it. dozens of incongruencies and massive plot holes are generated due to the ridiculous attempt at a shyamalan-like twist. if the absurd narrative decisions aren't enough, the horrible character scripts don't help the not-that-great acting, with the exception of portia doubleday and maggie q, the only good aspects of the whole movie. in the end, the two pillars of any movie (story and characters) are a total failure, making everything else fall apart with no possible salvation.

6879,"> _**review on horror focus_**

blumhouse is a strange one to predict when it comes to pumping out quality horror films. jason blum cleverly orchestrates a plethora of films on a tight-string budget, allowing some breathing space in the (un)likely case that one of his films is a flop. normally, this is not the case as blumhouse is prone to releasing the odd pg-13 horror movie every now and again, and strapping that age restriction on any horror already racks in the doe.

this, however, has no accounting for taste, as fans like myself can often be left puzzled by the fodder that is pumped out of the blumhouse canon a few times a year. with quite the eclectic resume of films under its belt, we were treated to the likes of halloween, get out and debatably the purge, and with the brilliant the invisible man coming out so recently, it's truly baffling how a film like fantasy island is also the product of the same company.

no production company or director is perfect, as we are often exposed to some atrocious pieces of work from our most-trusted filmmakers (with the exception of jordan peele duh!). blumhouse is not to be excluded as it isn't uncommon for them to pump out at least one absolute stinker a year, films that could easily go down as some of the worst the genre has to offer. blumhouse itself is largely successful overall, and very rarely releases an all-out disaster; but if you see that dreaded brand stapled onto the start of a film title ie. blumhouse's truth or dare, and blumhouse's fantasy island, know that what you're about to endure will be 100 minutes of mind-numbing torture.

image result for fantasy island

let's make one thing crystal clear, fantasy island is camp as tits. the problem here however is that it doesn't realise, which is ridiculous given its boistrous bravado. what we have is a half-baked, often muddled experience that is so oblivious to its own unique charm and goofiness that such comments end up becoming a serious negative. if fantasy island capitalised on its own brand of silly then this would be an entirely more enjoyable experience from that alone, but instead it takes itself far too seriously and often gets lost in its own waffle.

some elements here are promising, with the overall plot being somewhat intriguing, but its the sheer execution and over-crammed production halts any above average element from being anything more than ill-conceived and inept. the biggest problem lies in the fact that it never knows what it is, nor understand what it's trying to be. it never fully lands on being a jumpy scare-centric horror, nor does it fully execute its trippy midsommar-esque sci-fi rife that it tries so desperately to juggle.

fantasy island is first and foremost a generically dull experience, one that feels like three extremely underwhelming scripts stitches together like the knock-off leatherface mask. the final product is actually quite puzzling, one that has a troubled time trying to establish its own identity which inevitably leaks out onto its viewer, resulting in a nonsensical, head-scratchingly hollow experience that is as dense as it is naff.

 verdict 
word to the wise; like truth or dare, if blumhouse attach their name onto the front of a film title like they're clive barker, save yourself time and avoid it. this is one getaway you definitely want to cancel",low

i've watched some incredible films during my life. some offered me a blast of pure entertainment, others left me crying like a baby, and dozens made me laugh uncontrollably. nevertheless, the most memorable movies are the ones that profoundly impact me emotionally either by remembering me of a past phase of my life or by possessing main characters who i can strongly relate to. what might be ""just another film"" for most viewers can ultimately become a personal journey for other people in the audience, which is how i partially experienced the father. i didn't have massive expectations for the movie itself, but i was curious to know how great anthony hopkins would be.

while the legendary actor is undoubtedly a notable standout, florian zeller's creative, unconventional storytelling left me completely floored. by the end of the film, i felt emotionally drained of all my feelings and thoughts due to the increasingly heavier, devastating narrative co-written by zeller and christopher hampton, adapted from the former's award-winning play, le père. this could have been yet another generic story about dementia, but zeller's brilliant storytelling places the viewer in the protagonist's skin, offering a terrifying viewpoint of the disease. from the very first minute until the end, the spectators accompany anthony, an old man starting to lose track of reality, through his own perspective.

i genuinely don't know if this sort of point of view has been depicted before, particularly in the case of dementia, but either way, it's a harrowing experience that will surely leave a vast majority of its viewers extremely captivated throughout the entire runtime. watching anthony go through scenes that he wholly believes are indeed happening as he sees them is as attention-grabbing as it is frustrating and sad once the audience gets to see how the same scenes really played out. in fact, if one starts watching the movie without even knowing the synopsis, the first act will almost seem like a mystery-thriller due to so many twists and turns regarding previous conversations that anthony and the viewers believe are 100% real.

zeller and hampton's script doesn't only approach anthony's feelings but also the loved ones surrounding him, which i firmly believe was both necessary and honest. the father doesn't shy away from showing the boiled-up frustration and even desperation that the family usually goes through when dealing with someone with this terrible health condition. i have no words to describe how thoughtful and impactful zeller's storytelling method ends up being. i found myself remarkably surprised once i realized the film had reached the one-hour mark. the control of the movie's pacing and tone is absolutely seamless. technically, yorgos lamprinos' editing work is as impeccable as ben smithard's lingering cinematography.

however, it's ludovico einaudi's outstanding score that steals the spotlight in the technical realm. from the atmospheric, grand opera music to the more subtle tracks, einaudi makes sure to elevate the critical moments with a noticeable sound that helps the viewer understand the progressive shift in anthony's perception of reality. zeller demonstrates immense talent in his feature film directorial debut. being an adaptation from his own play certainly aids him in bringing the story from stage-to-screen, but his filmmaking choices are worthy of recognition, such as the extensive use of long takes to let the actors shine in their layered roles. and since i mentioned the cast...

anthony hopkins delivers an award-worthy performance that only finds in chadwick boseman (ma rainey's black bottom) a serious rival for this year's awards season. hopkins holds countless astonishing displays throughout his career, but this one is definitely one of my favorites. i never anticipated i'd shed so many tears by watching an old man cry or getting slapped in the face, though it's not even due to the acts themselves but to everything that builds up those moments. during most of the runtime, i don't really feel sadness or anger. instead, i feel every character's pain because it's incredibly hard to watch how everyone deals with the situation. hopkins and olivia colman are undoubtedly the most impactful, but olivia williams and imogen poots also add a lot to the sentimental component.

i insinuate above that the father impacted me at a personal level. a little bit about my life: my grandfather didn't have dementia, but his mind slowly deteriorated until it reached a point where he had to spend his last few months on this planet stuck in a bed without really talking or moving. still to this day, part of me regrets not spending that much time with him near the end, while the other part feels a bit relieved that my memory of him in his ""normal"" state remains intact. i always feared that if i visited him often in his last days of living, i'd only remember his time at the nursing home instead of the years packed with tremendously essential lessons he taught me. this movie left me sleepless, spending the night thinking about that time of my life...

the father is an overwhelmingly devastating depiction of the painfully progressive disease that is dementia. florian zeller's extremely captivating storytelling places the viewers inside the protagonist's mind, making the audience witness and feel everything through his unclear perspective. zeller and christopher hampton deliver a brilliantly unique screenplay packed with emotional punches that will leave no one indifferent. from the perfect editing to the persistent camera work, it's ludovico einaudi's gorgeous, impactful score that elevates the big moments. zeller's use of long takes feels both necessary and important to attach the viewers' attention to anthony hopkins, who delivers an award-worthy, powerfully compelling performance. one of my favorites of his entire career. hopefully, this will be the closest i'll ever be to experience this mental condition. my personal connection to this film justifies why i'll offer it my highest rating since november 2019 (ford v ferrari). one of the best movies i've seen in the last couple of years. do not miss it!

one of the worst movies i've seen in my entire life! no, i'm not going to ease you in. i literally spent ninety minutes of my weekend feeling frustrated, angry, stressed out, and genuinely annoyed at how many aspects force of nature is horrible at. this is an atrocious film in every imaginable way. there's no redeeming quality or a little tiny positive note. i'm going to be as straightforward as i can. i'm not going to waste the usual time i need to write a review, this one will be written in less than fifteen minutes.

first of all, the narrative. this movie is about a group of thieves that attempt to steal something from a building during a storm. it's a category 5 hurricane, and all the film shows is rain. there are no windows breaking, doors flying, or any sort of indication that the weather is dangerous in any way. every single character is plainly stupid. there's no way of describing them more accurately. everyone makes astonishingly dumb decisions, based on the most illogical and unrealistic scenarios.

the action lacks everything it must have: energy, choreography, good editing, and everything else you can think of. a character dies, the camera goes in for a close-up, and the eyes are still freaking moving. that's the level of amateurism force of nature displays. the sound design comes from the past century, with punches, kicks, and gunshots sounding like i'm watching an anime. the editing is terrible throughout, but it's far from grabbing the spotlight with so many baffling stuff.

even the cast delivers laughable performances. emile hirsch (cardillo) has the worst emotional range i've ever seen in an actor. his expressions are cringe-worthy in almost every single situation, independently of how serious the latter is or not. i have no idea what mel gibson (ray) is doing in such a wretched flick. the ""plot armor"" that protagonists regularly possess is taken to a whole new level. usually, they survive a 99%-chance of dying scenario, and the audience simply accept it. but the ""bad guys"" in this movie are ridiculously portrayed, almost like the actors are interpreting caricatures of their characters.

throughout the whole film, i felt continuously frustrated. every single minute is packed with story inconsistencies and truly irritating characters. i've never felt so uncomfortable watching a movie before. i never wished so hard for a film to finally end. i was moving around on my couch and giving these nervous chuckles because i was honestly feeling extremely annoyed at what i was watching. michael polish and cory miller should be ashamed of what they did. this is an embarrassment for any filmmaker. believe me: i could easily write 2000+ words about this piece...

force of nature is indeed a force to be reckoned with... for the ""worst movies i've ever seen"" contest. from the baffling character decisions to the illogically absurd narrative, michael polish directs an appalling film packed with excruciatingly embarrassing acting, horribly dated sound design, a nonsensical attempt at creating a catastrophic atmosphere, awful editing, impressively lousy action, and last but not least, one of the worst screenplays ever put to screen, by cory miller. the level of amateurism is genuinely jaw-dropping. i've never felt so uncomfortable watching a heist movie. i'm feeling incredibly frustrated, bitter, annoyed, and unsure how a film like this was made possible. please, stay away from this abomination. even if you're interested in watching it just to know how bad it actually is, be careful. because you're not going to feel that well after watching mel gibson fall to this level.

6909,"after we collided is fond of quoting wuthering heights, but it owes more to twilight and 50 shades of grey (the novel, called after, whose film adaptation this is the sequel to, originally appeared on wattpad, where every asshole can publish regardless of whether or not they should).

unlike heathcliff and catherine (and by extension romeo and juliet, begetters of all modern star-crossed lovers), though, tessa (josephine langford) and hardin (hero fiennes tiffin) have absolutely no impediment to their being together other than that they are totally wrong for each other.

the only chemistry between the two is sexual; after we collided is much more lubricious than twilight, but a lot less risqué than 50 shades — that is, there’s lots of implied sex but very little nudity. since there is no reason for these two to be together, we don't give two craps if they aren't.

not that the movie doesn’t try to manufacture such a reason; for example, emotionally scarred bad boy hardin (tiffin may be ralph fiennes’s nephew, but comes across more as a young, brittish-accented joshua jackson) has nightmares, but they stop when he starts dating tessa. this is is total nonsense; sleeping with someone doesn’t equal sleeping better.

but that’s the film’s naïve love conques all mentality. love may indeed conquer many things, but an inert, lethargic plot is not one of them. the only part of the script that doesn't ring hollow is the title, which is very appropriate because the action, such as it is, completely lacks urgency. nothing is resolved now, everything is left for later — to the point that two sequels were in the works at the time of this one’s release.",low
6915,"**_starts brilliantly but ultimately undermines itself with plot contrivances and genre foolishness_**

>_i went over the heads of the things a man reckons desirable. no doubt invisibility made it possible to get them, but it made it impossible to enjoy them when they are got._

- h.g. wells; _the invisible man_ (1897)

h.g. wells's original _the invisible man_ (1897) suggests that rather than something as powerful as invisibility being used for the betterment of mankind, it would instead be used to fulfil private desires, ultimately leading to the moral corruption of otherwise good men. in probably the best cinematic adaptation, paul verhoeven's _hollow man_ (2000), this is taken much further, with the suggestion that the results of invisibility would be nothing less than sexual violence, evil, and madness. however, despite the centrality of this theme in the core story, reframing the template as a modern tale of domestic abuse and ptsd, as happens in this latest adaptation, is a fascinating idea. reorienting the narrative so it no longer focuses on the male scientist but on a female victim of his machinations creates the potential for some timely #metoo social commentary, particularly as it relates to issues of not believing women who accuse powerful men of gaslighting. but potential only gets you so far, and what could have been a really insightful film eventually proves itself relatively incapable of using issues of domestic abuse as anything other than plot points to get from one predictable scare to the next. it tries to have its cake and eat it – it wants to be an allegory for the problems women face leaving abusive relationships but it also wants to be an effective monster movie. and, ultimately, it ends up as neither.

the film begins as cecilia kass (elisabeth moss) is putting into motion a plan to leave her domineering and abusive boyfriend, adrian griffin (oliver jackson-cohen), a wealthy pioneer in optics. having drugged him, she leaves their high-tech home in the middle of the night and is picked up nearby by her sister emily (harriet dyer), who takes her to stay with their childhood friend, james lanier (aldis hodge), a policeman living with his daughter sydney (storm reid). although assured that adrian can't find her, cecilia is clearly suffering from agoraphobia and paranoia. that is until adrian commits suicide. contacted by his brother tom (michael dorman), who's handling his estate, cecilia learns that adrian has left her $5 million. however, despite her best efforts to move on, she just can't shake the feeling that adrian is still around, watching her, sometimes even in the same room as her. and the surer she becomes that he's not dead, the more everyone else becomes worried about her mental well-being.

written and directed by leigh whannell (co-creator of the _saw_ franchise and creator of the _insidious_ franchise), this latest adaptation of wells's original is not actually about the invisible man. indeed, short of a background shot of him lying in bed, a shot showing only his torso as he runs through a forest, and a close-up of his hand, actor oliver jackson-cohen doesn't even appear on screen prior to his apparent suicide. adrian is not only the invisible man of the plot, so too is his character ideologically invisible. which makes its own statement, and it's a statement worth making – men like him don't need to be present to continue to cause harm; years of abuse will carry on their work even if they're no longer around. in this sense, at least initially, the film is more concerned with the fear adrian has instilled in cecilia; in the early stages, cecilia's main enemy isn't adrian so much her inability to move on from him. along the same lines, the film looks at issues of how women who accuse powerful men of gaslighting are often ignored or openly disbelieved. it is, of course, allegorical insofar as cecilia isn't claiming that adrian is just gaslighting her, she's claiming that he's literally turned himself invisible to drive her insane, but some of the best allegory works by exaggeration, and/or rendering something abstract as something more tangible.

aesthetically, the film looks terrific. designed by alex holmes (_wish you were here_; _the babadook_; _the nightingale_), adrian's house is a modernist maze of glass, mirrors, sliding panels, and open space, and the ultra-high-tech nerve centre from which he controls his kingdom is one of the film's only overt nods to science fiction (aside from the whole invisibility thing, of course). the real aesthetic strength, however, is the cinematography by stefan duscio (_jungle_; _upgrade_; _judy & punch_), into which is built cecilia's paranoia. for example, countless scenes involve the camera panning away from her, moving across the room, showing us nothing at all, and then panning back. ordinarily, this would be textbook unmotivated camera movement, but here it conveys how cecelia fears there may be something in the corner to which we panned. and now, thanks to that camera pan, so do we. there are also many shots which in another film would be awful framing; isolating cecilia in the frame and filling up so much of the screen's real-estate with empty negative space. except, again, in this film, such negative space has an ominousness not applicable to regular thrillers. in this way, whannell can instil fear and dread simply by pointing the camera at an empty room without the need for any fx, vfx, makeup, elaborate props etc (which no doubt played a significant role in keeping the budget down to a minuscule $7 million). and i'd be remiss if i didn't mention moss's performance, which is excellent, especially given that so much of it is her on her own reacting to nothing whatsoever, having to communicate confusion, fear, anger etc through little more than her expression.

before talking about why i didn't like the film, however, i want to reiterate that i honestly can't say how much i admire the idea to reconstitute the genre template as a story about domestic violence. and it's an especially timely reconstitution, coming as it does in the era of #metoo, when so many powerful men, once considered invisible in everything but name, able to perpetrate their crimes with impunity, have been revealed as the monsters they are. so i have no problem with the ideological paradigm shift. my problem is with the execution. 

for one thing, we know from the get-go that cecilia isn't imagining things, that adrian faked his suicide and is now stalking her whilst invisible. this isn't a twist, and the film makes no attempt to hide it. granted, this is kind of unavoidable given how well-known the property is, but had the film allowed for even a little bit of ambiguity, it could have done wonders for emotional complexity, turning a story about invisibility into a story possibly about mental collapse. this would have effectively placed the audience in the same position as the other characters, doubting cecilia's state of mind, which would, in turn, have enhanced the potency of the socio-political allegory. another thing that bothered me is that in a film so focused on surveillance and privacy, there are several scenes where if there is even one functioning cctv camera, the movie ends. a pivotal scene in a restaurant is an especially egregious example of this – one grainy image from a camera, and cecilia can prove she's not going nuts and the whole plot unravels. also, if you were so convinced that you were being stalked by someone invisible, might it not occur to you to invest in a pair of ir glasses for a few hundred bucks on amazon? just a thought.

however, my biggest problem is that what starts as a fascinating study of the lasting ramifications of domestic violence ultimately descends into genre stupidity, with a ridiculously over-the-top final act that says nothing of interest about anything. true, _hollow man_ has a pretty over-the-top final act too, but _hollow man_ never saw itself as anything other than a schlocky genre affair, whereas _the invisible man_ clearly does. the fact that whannell ultimately undermines himself in this way, deploying such important themes merely to get him to the gory _dénouement_, is especially frustrating insofar as he genuinely did originally seem to have some interesting things to say. tied to this is that adrian is introduced as such an abhorrent character from the start; he's essentially a comic book villain, void of nuance or subtlety. domestic abusers aren't monotone evil-doers, otherwise everyone would see through then. oftentimes, they're very charming on the surface, and any film claiming to be a serious examination of this topic would make room to address this.

although _the invisible man_ was very well reviewed and a huge box-office hit, it left me disappointed and frustrated. initially positioning itself as an insightful allegory for the difficulty victims of domestic abuse have in moving on with their lives even after the abuser is gone, it eventually privileges genre beats and cheap thrills over emotional complexity. which is a huge shame and a massively missed opportunity.",low

6927,"rather than a burst of cinematic energy, 'mank' is a considered, meticulous, subtle and ultimately furious film, one that continues to grow in your mind hours after seeing it. even after two viewings, i can still hear my mind chewing over every second, my heart quietly racing as i consider its individual moments of genius. this isn't some nostalgic elegy to a great film or a great artist, but a damning portrait of how systems of power can be misused, and how good men find themselves complicit. it speaks ferociously to our contemporary world, and reminds us of the important role of art in a functioning society. in that sense, 'mank' isn't a film about cinema; it's a film that asks what the point of cinema even is. it's a powerful, rebellious question to ask, and the kind of question only a filmmaker as skilled as david fincher would dare to, and the imagination to find the answer. in the process, he may have just delivered the best film of the year.

https://www.msbreviews.com

aaron sorkin has been around for quite some time. a few good men, moneyball, steve jobs, and arguably one of the best movies of the last decade, the social network, all have one thing in common: sorkin as a screenwriter, but not as the director. molly's game was sorkin's directorial debut, which makes the trial of the chicago 7 only his second time in the director's chair. i've either loved or liked every film from him, so obviously, my expectations were already high enough solely due to his presence. however, with the announcement of such a stellar cast, it's impossible not to expect one of the best movies of the year to come out of this project...

expectations fulfilled. this is, in fact, one of 2020's very best films, without the shadow of a doubt. based on real events, the movie quickly jumps to the main point of action: the trial. only twenty minutes in, the viewer is already inside the famous courtroom where the expected and the unexpected occur simultaneously. sorkin's employs a narrative structure that keeps me captivated until the final credits start to roll. the actions that led to this court case are demonstrated throughout the same instead of being shown through a linear timeline, which would reduce the trial's value. it's the main reason why such a simple premise turns into a phenomenal adaptation of the historical event.

i couldn't take my eyes off-screen for a single second or lose one of the many incredible dialogues. every conversation, every argument, every objection, overrule, or ""motion denied"" is transmitted to the viewer in an exceptionally captivating manner. it's one of those movies where the ""action"" belongs to words instead of fists. i felt tremendously invested in the trial. it never loses a gram of interest, it's full-on exciting all the time. i desperately wanted to find out the result of the case (i didn't possess knowledge of the real story, but i'll address this further down). i really wanted to witness the events that put the defendants in their respective positions. i strongly desired to see the end of the situation.

as soon as the film ends, i felt the urge to immediately research everything about the true story. i spent close to forty-five minutes reading many articles about the 1968 democratic national convention, the riots, the presidential nominees... everything. this is one of the most important criteria i have to define how successful a historical flick truly is: how much does it compel me to research everything about it. the trial of the chicago 7 convinces me to study the real events with significant impact. from what i've read, sorkin changes a few details timeline-wise (something pretty common in this type of movie), but overall, it's a pretty accurate, realistic adaptation.

technically, every component is remarkable, as expected from a netflix-sorkin partnership. however, the score plays a special part since its volume in crescendo elevates several escalating situations, leaving me at the edge of my couch, biting my nails. it's a fantastic achievement from daniel pemberton, who also scored birds of prey and enola holmes this year. additionally, this might not be a one-location film, but sorkin keeps the camera so focused on the courtroom that it feels like the audience is stuck in there with the defendants.

besides sorkin's screenplay, the cast obviously plays a massive role. just like i mentioned above, this is a movie where the ""action"" is played out through words. inside the courtroom, there are constant arguments, countless contempts of court, a voir dire (it doesn't hurt to google courtroom terminology before the film), and so much more that leads the judge to make questionable decisions based on shocking evidence. every actor is absolutely outstanding, i was able to feel everything during that trial, but i do have four standouts.

sacha baron cohen (abbie hoffman) shares the laugh spotlight with jeremy strong (jerry rubin), but he ends up being the ultimate comic relief. his delivery and timing are pure gold. i can't deny that i was surprised by his performance since i've only seen him in borat. he's extremely funny, but don't be mistaken by my words: abbie proves to be one of the most essential defendants in the trial, offering a memorable testimony and demonstrating his real purpose. eddie redmayne brings his oscar-winner face to the game by interpreting tom hayden. a vital character that lets the viewer know that while they might not all be completely guilty, they're not all exactly innocent as well. hayden's final speech is one of redmayne's best scenes of his career.

mark rylance plays the role of the public, portraying the defendants' lawyer, william kunstler. he shares the viewer's frustration with the judge's decisions but never gives up, trying to bring justice to the case. if i had to bet on an actor to get awards buzz by the end of the year, it would be rylance due to his powerful display. my last standout is frank langella as the judge julius hoffman. i believe a lot of people will give credit to every actor for portraying characters they love, but most will forget the actor that interprets the character everyone hates. langella deserves all of the praise in the world for making me despise completely such an unfair, racist, unqualified judge. his performance is simply extraordinary.

these are my four standouts, but the entire cast is phenomenal. i'm a bit disappointed that i didn't get to see more from yahya abdul-mateen ii (bobby seale), but after researching bobby's involvement in this story, i understand his lack of relevance to the main narrative. he plays more of a modern parallel to the 60s in the sense that the judge heavily discriminates against him during the trial, transmitting a message that humanity's behavior may have evolved regarding racism, but there's still a long way to go. a final shoutout to joseph gordon-levitt, who is also excellent as richard schultz.

i only have one issue. in terms of entertainment, the viewer entering the main stage after only twenty minutes is a bold yet efficient move. however, the introduction to the characters and the story itself goes by so fast that i could only understand who's who and their purpose during the trial. sorkin assumes people know everything about who these characters are, what they did, and where the narrative is driving towards, skipping through dozens of details that (mostly) non-american audiences will struggle to understand in time. sorkin could have given these characters more depth initially, offering the viewer time to get familiar with their names and organizations.

all in all, the trial of the chicago 7 is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year, probably the best at the date of this review. aaron sorkin's narrative structure and the brilliant cast are the two main reasons why this film succeeds so well. sorkin's screenplay is organized in a way that keeps the viewer astonishingly captivated throughout the entire runtime by following a nonlinear structure. maintaining the focus on a single location is an exceptional decision for a movie where words are the action of the story. inside the courtroom is where every fascinating argument ensues, never losing steam until the very end. it's also a lot funnier than i expected. regarding the cast, sacha baron cohen, mark rylance, eddie redmayne, and frank langella are my standouts, but every actor delivers outstanding performances. daniel pemberton's score shines in an overall very well-produced film. the first twenty minutes fly by in favor of entertainment by quickly placing the viewer inside the courtroom, but it's so rushed that it makes it difficult for the audience to remember everyone's names and purposes. assuming everyone knows the true story and the people involved is a risky move, especially for non-americans. nevertheless, this minor issue doesn't affect an otherwise flawless movie. obviously, i strongly recommend it! maybe reading a bit about the real events beforehand will help the eventual viewing, but don't read too much due to the usual spoilers.

horror is no longer just slasher movies with men in masks lurking around corners; it is now encompassing more everyday, real-life horrors. even the terror of running into your ex-girlfriend and current sugar daddy at a shiva.

that’s the general plot of emma seligman’s impressive debut, _shiva baby_. the movie begins with college senior danielle (rachel sennott) waking up in her sugar daddy max’s (danny deferrari) apartment. she’s running late to a shiva (we don’t ever find out who died) where she meets her parents (fred melamed and polly draper). among the other guests are her ex-girlfriend maya (molly gordon), max, max’s wife (dianna agron), and their infant child. danielle sees all of these people in the same room, and her anxiety skyrockets. the movie takes place over the course of about two fictional hours, and the action occurs almost entirely in one home. it is a brisk 78 minutes, and that’s a perfect runtime. another moment of this familial, heart-racing anxiety would have been too much for the audience to handle.",high

... and it's not a political lecture, which makes it a cut above almost everything hollywood is putting out.

6962,"<em>'riders of justice'</em> - entertaining!

based on the poster alone i was expecting a standard <em>'john wick'</em>-esque action flick, and after the opening few scenes i was anticipating a by-the-numbers revenge flick of mads mikkelsen going full dwayne johnson in <em>'faster'</em>. not that i would've been disappointed with that (i enjoy that latter film), but i like how the filmmakers added some additional elements to the story to make it more absorbing. it's amusing too, e.g. lennart's gun assembly made me laugh.

not that it comes as a surprise whatsoever, but mads mikkelsen is excellent throughout - of all the characters i've seen him play, i think this is my favourite 'look' of a character of his thus far... perhaps aside from *that* unforgettable trim in <em>'the green butchers'</em>. nikolaj lie kaas, lars brygmann, nicolas bro and andrea heick gadeberg are deserving of praise too.

i had a great time watching this across its near two hour run time. i don't have any issues with it, if i was forced to bring up something it would be the perhaps under characterization of the titular bunch but that's me fully reaching and then some for a 'negative'.

i thought the first one was brilliant, and the second was an ok action/comedy but didn't have as many subtle spoofs, but still was a decent action movie.

this one, on the other hand i'd only give one star because i do an all or nothing thing... but it was better than lethal weapon 4 wasn't it? it was better than kingdom of the crystal skull. it was better than coming two america. it was better than most of the made it far too late where the original cast was far too old sequels that plague hollywood like remakes.

so i guess i'll give it 10 stars because if hollywood is going to make a sequel way too late for a sequel, this is sort of how you would want them to do it.

there's nothing i can say i really love about it, but there is also nothing i can say i hate about it, and for a sequel that should either have never been made or should have been made a decade earlier, it's not a bad film. and that sort of makes it great in today's everything is humorless and political era.",low
6972,"in one of the most mediocre movies so far this year, “bloodshot” squanders every last positive thing it has going for it. based on the bestselling sci-fi comic book, the film tells the story of recently killed soldier ray garrison (vin diesel) who is brought back to life as a super-assassin. ray has an army of nanotechnology in his veins, making him an outrageously strong, unstoppable force who has the ability to instantly heal any injuries he sustains in combat. when his memories begin to contradict what’s reality and what’s fiction, ray starts to suspect lead scientist dr. harting (guy pearce) may have sinister intentions — and he does everything in his superhuman power to stop him.

the film lacks enough material for a feature length film, and it feels like the story has been stretched out from the get-go. the plot is far-fetched but interesting, yet the best elements are dismissed in a rushed fashion. the film could’ve gone one of two ways, and it chooses the path of greatest disappointment, which leaves it in this weird limbo. it’s not quite smart enough and not quite dumb enough to work. like when director dave wilson gets the sense that things are lagging, he inserts a not-so-subtle explosion or dick joke to keep things moving along. yeah, it’s that kind of bad.

even the action scenes fall victim to rapid-fire editing that is intended to disguise the bloodless pg-13 action flick. there’s an almost-satisfying extended fight sequence involving elevators and a skyscraper, but it comes late in the film when most audiences will likely have already lost interest. even worse, there are no consequences because ray can’t be hurt or killed, and the special effects look like they were created in a couple of hours by a pre-teen boy on the family room laptop.

diesel is not a great actor, but that’s never been a job requirement to bring the charismatic, cinematic muscle to the big screen. he’s a perfectly acceptable action star, but here he turns in a laughably bad performance. his poor acting hogs the spotlight, especially when he shares scenes opposite the talented pearce.

this movie is absolute junk that will die a quick death at the box office. please, audiences: do your part to put “bloodshot” out of its misery.",low

first of all, no. i've never read the comic book, so i didn't know a single thing about the superhero bloodshot going in. what i did know was that jeff wadlow was in command of the screenplay, and we all know how extremely horrible his latest movies are (truth or dare, fantasy island). add vin diesel as the protagonist and a first-time director (david s. f. wilson), it's impossible to have high expectations for such a film, no matter how good the source material is. maybe it could surprise me and end up being a reasonably decent flick...

it didn't. bloodshot is even worse than i expected. i genuinely thought that the action would be the movie's savior. i didn't watch any trailers, as usual, but i did see an image here and there of that red smoke, as well as a couple of glances at the regenerating cgi. honestly, it's the most disappointing aspect of the whole film. simply because it's the only thing i was expecting to be decent, at least. the ""final battle"" has some of the worst cgi of the century, and it goes on for way too long. there's an abundance of shaky-cam, the editing is truly awful at times, a lot of action sequences are barely understandable, and even the slow-motion is overused.

however, the reason why the movie ultimately fails is, once again, due to wadlow's screenplay (which he co-wrote with eric heisserer, but wadlow is the main one). as always, his narrative is a total mess. confusing, lacks creativity, raises tons of logical questions, and the real past of ray garrison is empty of any explanation. the ending is not only predictable and formulaic, but it also generates even more questions, leaving the viewer frustrated with so many unanswered plot points. david leitch and chad stahelski (both have deadpool and john wick in their filmography) left the project right after being hired as the directors... i wonder why?!

the first minutes are probably the best of the entire runtime. i mean, excluding a not-sexy-at-all scene featuring vin diesel and talulah riley (gina garrison). that was cringe-worthy. nevertheless, the story's concept is really captivating, to say the least (or the comic book wouldn't have its remarkable success). it's one of those action flicks that could easily turn into a successful franchise if the people involved in the project are more talented. with this, i transition to another of my main issues: vin diesel.

very rarely, i negatively criticize an actor's performance. i admit that i'm easily pleased by any cast. if you ask me ""what's an actor/actress you don't like?"", i would probably be stuck for an answer. diesel's display is so emotionless that even someone like me can be affected by it. besides being a rock throughout the whole film, diesel has this weird habit of talking very loud and clear, only to instantly lower his volume so much that he's almost whispering. he does this consecutively and repeatedly in almost every dialogue.

there's no care for developing a single character, not even the protagonist. everyone is just a stereotype of some secondary action character: the funny it guy, the hot girl who develops feelings for the hero, the male teammate who gets jealous that his alpha territory gets invaded, and the ""motivation-less bad guy who's made look like a good guy in the beginning, but we all know who he truly is""... literally, the two most talented actors (toby kebbell and talulah riley) are the ones with the least amount of screentime.

in the end, bloodshot is even worse than i expected. the messy, formulaic, and logically questionable screenplay by jeff wadlow and eric heisserer is the worst aspect of the movie, but the action is undoubtedly the most disappointing one. the ""final fight"" is one of the worst cgi sequences of the century, and the action throughout the runtime is filled with an uncontrollable shaky-cam, an excess of slow-motion, and some poor editing, making most of these scenes incredibly hard to follow. vin diesel delivers as much emotion as a rock, and while the rest of the cast is fine, the characters follow every single stereotype ever written for an action flick. it also doesn't help to put a first-time director in charge of the whole thing, but david s. f. wilson is far from being the one to blame. occasionally good action moments and a great concept just barely keep the film breathing. it's one of the worst movies of the year.

out of my top15: most anticipated movies of 2020, eight were removed from this year's schedule due to the current global pandemic, so i didn't have that many films for which i felt incredibly excited. i love pretty much everything that pixar puts out, and at the start of 2020, i noticed that the studio was releasing not one but two original animated movies, something quite uncommon in their history (only happened in 2015 and 2017). onward was yet another success, but everyone knew soul was the studio's big gun. december release date means better chances to win an oscar, and the highly anticipated return of pete docter (monsters inc., up, inside out) to the director and writer's chairs also elevates the film's expectations.

i'm no different. my expectations were high as the sky, but the main question in my mind wasn't really if soul was going to be a great movie, but if it would be so good i'd love it more than wolfwalkers, my favorite animated flick of the year so far? well, let me write that it's a wonderful, beautiful, heartwarming tie. i love them both very much, and i wouldn't be surprised if i saw them in my top10. however, this is soul's spotlight, so let me get to it, and spit out the only minor issue i have with the film. during the first act, i couldn't feel a connection to the story nor the characters. it took me a while to really get fully invested in the narrative, and even technical aspects such as the animation style and the score (trent reznor, atticus ross) felt weirdly out-of-place and surprisingly not that enthralling.

nevertheless, this slow, unconvincing beginning doesn't negatively impact the movie overall, as most of these apparently awkward components improve as time goes by. from the moment it clicked with me, i went on that emotional rollercoaster i always expect to ride in a pixar feature. the studio is known for its extremely heartfelt, shocking, tear-inducing third acts, and even though soul isn't an exception to that rule, it's far from being one of those mind-blowing, jaw-dropping, devastating final minutes. its third act is astonishingly emotional, and it sends a lovely message to the audience, one that made me reflect on the entire year and a specific moment in my life.

pete docter, mike jones, and kemp powers explore the taboo subject of life's meaning in a predictable yet profound and entertaining manner. the approach on philosophical questions like ""what's my purpose?"", ""what's my spark?"", or ""what does it mean to have a soul?"" is cleverly developed and very well-written. there's a sequence with the protagonist near the end that will make tons of viewers experience it simultaneously. i found myself rewatching this scene in particular to help me remember a certain period in my life where i realized that what i thought was my destiny was, in fact, just one of those life passions that leave us with unforgettable memories.

i was able to deal with that moment pretty well, but many people lose themselves once they figure out that what they thought they were meant to do/be isn't really what the future holds for them. they become lost souls, and only a spark of life can revitalize them. soul explores this matter in such an authentic, genuine, creative way that i couldn't help but cry as i do in every pixar film. watching soul will make you appreciate life a lot more, especially those tiny, little moments that we forget to remember. living, with all its horrible phases, is the best life experience anyone can have. after a year of isolation and separation from the people we love, this movie arrives at the perfect time.

technically, the animation style and score didn't convince me in the first few minutes, but by the end, they're part of the key aspects that made me cry like a baby. trent reznor and atticus ross are starting to become two of my favorite composers (the social network, gone girl, mank). pete docter proves that his undeniable talent behind the screen remains intact, and this time, he introduces hollywood to the debutants kemp powers and mike jones. jamie foxx and tina fey (22) deliver some terrific voice work, so expect them to receive dozens of nominations. finally, congratulations to every single artist that worked on this film's animation. these gifted people are the real stars of pixar.

all in all, soul is everything i expected it to be. a classic pixar feature, with the trademark emotionally powerful third act; a heartwarming, sweet, tear-inducing score; and a relatable, profound, well-explored story about our own soul and the meaning of life. pete docter delivers another award-worthy flick with the help of kemp powers and mike jones, and with the outstanding voices of jamie foxx and tina fey. it may start slow and follow a predictable path, but it's only a matter of time until every viewer connects with the main characters. soul surpasses the barriers of cinema, becoming a healing media from which people can take away so, so much. it works seamlessly as a reflection on life, and as a motivation to truly live every single moment of it. it's the ideal movie to watch on the morning of christmas day with the entire family cozy and warm in the living room. i promise you: it will make you enjoy this festive season a lot more. undoubtedly, one of the best films of the year.

6984,"this is my favorite disney pixar movie, even beating monster's inc!

there wasn't a minute where i wasn't enjoying the movie, there's very powerful meaning to this movie (that will go over kids' heads) and for once, it (in my opinion) tackles an issue big with teens and adults more than kids (at least more than usually).

the movie's message is (from what i understood it anyway) about anxiety, sadness, and fear of how you choose your life path. even going as far as showing how you're so-called purpose in life may not even be correct (or real to begin with).

this is by the creators of inside out, which gave really good messages across about feelings. it was more kid-oriented, so soul (in my opinion) being more about teens or adults was a surprise that i did not expect. i'm not saying this isn't a kids movie, i'm saying you shouldn't avoid it if you're not a kid.

it probably helps this movie that it's got it's messages across with music as an instrument (get it?), as i too love music heavily including all kinds of genres (seriously, if you saw my youtube music history you would think i'm somewhere between a 5-year-old girl, to a 101-year-old beatles fan).

i was never the biggest fan of scooby-doo's animated cartoon when i was young. i enjoyed it like any other kid who enjoys almost everything, but it was never a show that made me nervously excited during the day, waiting for it to come on tv. i vividly remember getting pumped, knowing that a new episode of dragon ball z or timon & pumba would broadcast on that particular day. i never felt that way with scooby-doo, and honestly, i don't know why. i was always curious about sci-fi and ""what lies beyond"", so maybe the fact that the goal of the show was to justify every single paranormal activity with some ""guy in a mask"" didn't really appeal to the kid in me...

either way, i still liked the series, and my memory is filled with all of the show's classic signatures: the (double or even triple) un-masking of the villains, scooby jumping to shaggy's arms because they both got scared, the ridiculously large sandwiches, you name it. ironically, the biggest compliment i can give the film also relates to its major flaw. for any fan of the show, these classic moments will provide high levels of nostalgia and entertainment, so anyone who comes looking for that will definitely get what they desire.

however, even though scoob! is far from feeling like a corporate flick packed with product placement (looking at you, sonic the hedgehog), i can't help but feel that the studio was embarrassed by its own property. they try so hard to make this movie belong to 2020 that they completely forgot about what makes the show special for so many people. from the weirdly confusing song selection to the way too modern plot points, scoob! 's narrative distinctly follows an avengers-style plot (including an obvious allusion to captain america holding his shield) focusing strongly on the superhero theme.

they didn't believe that mystery inc. and the (successful) formulaic story were enough to hold the target audience's attention, so they decided to borrow from one of the most entertaining and financially impactful genres of today, losing the essence of their own ip. therefore, despite scoob! having almost all of the cartoon's classic scenes, it still feels detached from the source material. in addition to this, if you're not a fan of scooby-doo and if you don't know anything about it, then don't expect this film to explain anything to you.

fred, velma, and daphne get separated from shaggy and scooby early on (due to a hilariously dumb scene that only kids will accept), so almost no character development occurs within the first group of people. this movie focuses more on the pair's adventure and their relationship dynamics (which are explored in a cliche yet efficient manner), leaving 3/5 of the mystery inc. feeling left off. actually, now that i think about it, scoob! doesn't even have a mystery to solve!

in the cartoons, every episode is about discovering what or who's causing a specific paranormal event. this film basically follows that formula for the first fifteen minutes (which serve as an origin story of the gang) and then takes an entirely different path story-wise. i'm not going to complain about the plot's absurdity because it's undeniably a kids' movie, but these forced attempts to adapt scooby-doo to 2020 are what ruin the whole thing for me. the voice acting is great, though, and hearing frank welker interpret scooby again is incredibly joyful.

all in all, scoob! possesses almost all of the classic moments from the original cartoon, which will surely leave fans of the series satisfied and feeling that heartwarming nostalgia. in addition to this, the voice work is really good for the most part, especially from the legend, frank welker as scooby. however, the studio hurts the film with countless attempts to adapt the formulaic yet successful screenplay that the show employed for decades into 2020. from the superhero-like plot to the lack of a central mystery, tony cervone finds himself in a writing mess (four screenwriters and three ""story by"" credits) from a company ashamed of its own product. if you're a hardcore fan of the animated show, this movie might leave you satisfied. but if you don't share a special connection with these characters and their classic adventures, or if you don't know anything about this franchise at all, scoob! not only doesn't care to introduce or develop its characters, but it definitely isn't going to convert you.

it's a brand new year, which means january gets to be the traditional ""trash month"" once again. in portugal, it's actually one of the best months of the year since all of the oscar-contender films are released (late) during these first few weeks. however, it still contains the formulaic action and/or horror movies. the grudge, a reboot of a remake (because why not?), is the most recent addition to the group of horror flicks that no one really understands why they were produced.

i was never a fan of the film series, so obviously, i wasn't expecting much from a reboot of a franchise that always looked like a lazily cheap way of filming a few jump scare sequences with no remarkable storytelling. nicolas pesce shows some hints of talent regarding his filmmaking skills with some efficiently suspenseful scenes, but the aspect to blame in this type of movies is always the same: screenplay. i can't remember the last film i saw that treated the audience like the dumbest people alive. it truly becomes disrespectful. it's like the producers thought that the target audience for a horror flick was 5-year-old children.

it reaches a point where the movie itself feels like it's being very intelligent in the way it shares plot information. it creates this tense build-up, filled with characters almost dropping a big twist, and then... it's something so evident since the first few minutes of the film. this process repeats throughout the entire runtime. ""here comes a big twist! are you ready? watch out! here it goes... bam! you didn't saw that coming, did you?!""

yes. we did. everyone did. even the theater supervisor who only shows up for a couple of seconds each half an hour was able to figure out everything that was happening. during the screening, i didn't know if i should laugh due to the ridiculously explicit plot points or if i should be frustrated for being treated like i was totally brainless. everything about the grudge feels painfully obvious. i try my best not to think too far ahead. i try not to predict what's going to occur or when a jump scare is going to happen. but this movie is so incredibly generic that i couldn't avoid knowing everything instinctively.

story-wise or jump scares, it doesn't matter. everything that pesce tries to do, it's surrounded by such an aura of predictability that makes this horror film extremely dull. i mean, that's one of the worst feelings one can have while watching a horror movie, right? how can someone feel bored by a film constantly throwing jump scares and ""massive"" plot points every five minutes? well, the grudge was able to accomplish this miracle.

i don't know why the grudge, as a film series, continues to exist. the first installment, which was itself a remake of the japanese original, was a surprising box office success. still, the majority of the audience and critics didn't really like the movie. the consequent theater releases were a disappointment. so, let's do a reboot of the remake, right? nicolas pesce seems to be a great filmmaker, he's able to easily generate tension and a dark environment, but such a huge misstep like this can hurt his career. the talented cast tries their best to bring this film to safe harbor, but the absurdly obvious, generic, formulaic, cliche story sunk the movie pretty hard. its lack of surprising features, the extremely predictable jump scares, and the complete disregard for the audience, treating the viewers like the dumbest people ever, make the grudge one of the worst horror films of the last few years.

7007,"the secret: dare to dream is based on a self-help book, which is turn based on a pseudocumentary. i have not read the book (nor will i ever), but judging from the movie, it must be a lot like brian griffin's wish it, want it, do it – complete with the 50 blank pages.

the first thing the movie does is instruct me that there are two ways i can live my life; one is as if everything were a miracle, and the other as if nothing were. but if everything is a miracle, then nothing is a miracle; the very concept of 'miracle' would not exist. let's put it this way: if everything were a miracle, then many of the things that jesus does in the bible would no longer be special.

the only gospel, however, that ts:dtd preaches is the new age gospel. god's name is invoked only once (when einstein is misquoted as saying that ""coincidence is god's way of staying anonymous""). the film revolves around the law of attraction, a pseudoscientific belief that positive or negative thoughts bring positive or negative experiences into a person's life.

the most curious thing about all this is that the movie stars katie holmes; this doesn't mean that she believes this nonsense, although it's no secret that she's not very picky when it comes to choosing belief systems; either way, i sincerely hope this is not what she left scientology for.

according to imdb, ""miranda (katie holmes) [is] a young widow trying to make ends meet while raising her three children and dating her boyfriend (jerry o'connell). a devastating storm brings an enormous challenge and a mysterious man, bray (josh lucas), into miranda's life. bray reignites the family's spirit but, unbeknownst to miranda, also holds an important secret - one that will change everything. with its timeless messages of hope, compassion, and gratitude, the secret: dare to dream is an inspiring and heartwarming film that shows how positive thoughts can transform our lives.""

the message is that if we think very hard we can all have a huge house, a pony, and a mac computer. of course there are caveats; sometimes you think of matthew mcconaughey and the best the universe can come up with is josh lucas. and what about tuck (o'connell), miranda's boyfriend – briefly fiancé – whose engagement ring she returns, breaking his heart? weren't his thoughts positive enough? or maybe he just looks too much like tom cruise for her taste.",low

the acting across the board is subpar, at best. that's a major disappointment, given robert de niro (ed), uma thurman (sally) and christopher walken (jerry) are involved. i don't necessarily feel like they weren't trying or anything, but i just didn't sense any spark from them. the kid actors, meanwhile, are average.

as you might now, this remake is one of my most anticipated movies of 2020 (list here). i've at least ""liked"" almost every remake disney has delivered so far, so i was incredibly excited that 1998's mulan was getting the same treatment. niki caro made it clear this would be an entirely different version of the story we all know and love. a more realistic take on the chinese tale, one that removes all songs and fan-favorite characters like mushu, which instantly impacted expectations, varying tremendously from person to person. people who would love a remake quite similar to the original will enter the film already slightly discouraged. however, to everyone who complained about disney copying their original ip, mulan might be their best chance to like a remake from the studio.

in my opinion, a remake should have a bit of both. it must keep the original's essence and message while delivering something that distinguishes it from the former. any remake must always prove the reasons behind its existence. it must have something that makes the viewers think: ""i like this part that's not in the original"". aladdin has a new arc given to jasmine. beauty and the beast provides beast with a better-developed storyline. even the lion king, a remake that convinced many people to call it a shot-for-shot (it isn't), presents a groundbreaking visual experience that's incomparable to the original. therefore, i was genuinely hyped for mulan and what niki caro could bring with her more pragmatic cut...

i can't deny it: i feel extremely disappointed. in my review of the original movie, i mention how epic and cinematic it feels. it was one of the aspects i looked forward to the most in this new version. despite the beautiful set design and some painting-like shots, this is the first time a disney's live-action remake loses to its original regarding its visuals. the 2d animation from more than twenty years ago feels superior in every single aspect. there's only one shot in the entire remake that i would put in the original, and i bet it would look and feel a lot more emotionally significant. the action sequences are unimaginative and incredibly disjointed. except for a few great war moments, most action scenes are packed with excessive cgi, a badly employed hfr (high frame rate), and overediting.

in fact, the editing (david coulson) is weirdly overworked throughout the entire runtime, cutting too much and omitting sequences that were supposed to significantly impact the narrative. from character-defining moments to simple connections between scenes, it feels like the film is hiding something. i constantly needed to rely on my knowledge of the original to remember why certain moments are meaningful to a character or to the story itself because this remake straight-up removes these moments without replacing them with something else. even in chronological terms, it's clumsily put together, jumping from location to location without actually showing the characters moving from one place to another.

finally, as my last remark on the technical aspects, harry gregson-williams' score is partially also a letdown. like the rest of the movie, there are some nice touches and lovely homages to the songs everyone cherishes, especially reflection. i had already mentalized myself to ignore the absence of songs because i believed harry would find a way to replace them with a similarly grand score that i would definitely enjoy. however, mulan's score fails not only to elevate a single battle sequence but also to deliver that cinematic atmosphere that i was looking forward to so much. i didn't get chills during the entire film. it didn't transform any big character moments. maybe watching it on imax instead of at home might improve my opinion, but i doubt that.

story-wise, it's a mixed bag for me. niki caro promised a more realistic take, totally different from the original, and she undoubtedly accomplished that. this is the furthest from the original any disney remake has been, by far. from the replacement of characters to an overall change to the main narrative, mulan is more faithful to the original chinese tale than the 1998's flick, but that doesn't mean it's better, much on the contrary. the essence and message are there but told through a distinct perspective, which some people will find hard to accept, especially hardcore fans of the original movie. however, i do believe that hua mulan still carries the characteristics that made me care about her.

her courage and bravery to go to war in order to save her father from certain death. her love and devotion to her family, who she wants to honor. hua mulan doesn't want to just be the wife of some random man nor be imprisoned by dated stereotypes. this is all in the remake but told through the lenses of a protagonist who already has everything she needs to lead a nation. this is the main difference character-wise, but one that doesn't affect the nature of the original. however, it impacts the remake itself. while all of this sounds amazing, mulan sort of contradicts itself by making her main character feel unique and different from everyone else, distancing her more from people than actually embracing her.

like i already mentioned above, this is an entirely altered version of the story everyone knows. i do welcome every change made, including the removal of mushu, cri-kee, and all of the singing. however, if something's removed, something else has to replace it in some shape or form. once again, i have mixed feelings. some additions, like the introduction of chi and the witch xian lang (gong li), are refreshing but poorly developed throughout the runtime. the vital energy force is connected to my issue with the ""be yourself"" message, while the character not only follows a predictable arc, but it diminishes bori khan's (jason scott lee) menacing presence.

the ending feels remarkably underwhelming as well. not only the climactic fight between hua mulan and bori khan fails to live up to expectations, but it's executed in a visually disheartening fashion. i expected this remake to feel grand, magnificent, epic, and cinematic, just like its original or even better. it's far from that. the acting could also be better. liu yifei is fantastic as hua mulan, yoson an offers a subtle yet efficient interpretation of chen honghui, and the actors who portray yao (chen tang), ling (jimmy wong), and chien-po (doua moua) are also amusing. however, donnie yeng as commander tung and jet li as the emperor are embarrassingly bland, while jason scott lee is visually perfect casting as the main villain, but he's not able to shine.

in the end, mulan is the most disappointing remake disney has made so far and by far. even though niki caro delivers the realistic, distinct take that was promised, its execution feels inferior to the original animated film in every single way. technically and visually, it's the first live-action remake from the respective studio that loses in almost every aspect to the 2d animation from more than twenty years ago. the 1998's movie is far more epic and cinematic than its remake. the disjointed editing is overworked to the point of omitting and skipping through character-defining moments. the action scenes are packed with unnecessary cgi that takes away from the war set pieces, which also look small in scale. the musical score isn't able to replace the songs from the original, overflowing the film with a weirdly empty feeling. despite liu yifei delivering a good performance as the protagonist as well as a few of her colleagues, the acting is pretty mediocre overall. story-wise, it's a mixed bag. it's an undoubtedly unique version, the furthest that a disney's remake has ever been from its original, which will instantly upset some and please others. i praise the courage and bravery in producing such a different version. there are dozens of new additions that i sincerely appreciate, but their execution lacks emotional impact, ultimately being decisions inferior to the ones of the original. the message and essence of the original are still present through another perspective, which is the best compliment i can give to an otherwise quite disappointing remake...

i've always been a tremendous fan of animation. if there's one comment i deeply despise is the ""animated films are for children"". this preconceived notion is extremely dated, and honestly, quite childish. i don't even think it works within a teenage banter anymore since anime keeps growing exponentially around the world, and animated movies are reaching more and more people as time goes by. the whole ""you watch cartoons, you're a baby"" bullying statement to make friends laugh about someone is now decades-old. however, i still feel a bit of pity for people who believe animation can't have the same emotional impact than live-action, especially when a major studio like pixar is known for making the most grown-up of adults cry like an infant.

in addition to this, some viewers think that the latter studio owned by disney is the only company making decent animated flicks when they've been losing ground to other unbelievably talented people. one of my favorite animated films of all-time is kubo and the two strings, a stop-motion animation work from laika, the studio that also created missing link and coraline. cartoon saloon is emerging as an awards-contender studio, by releasing movies such as song of the sea, the breadwinner, and now wolfwalkers. the main difference between this last company and the others is the style of animation: the ""old"" 2d animation that 90s kids like me grew up with.

that's precisely where i'm starting this review. wolfwalkers' 2d animation proves once again that this style will never become ""dated"" or ""less than"" the current 3d design. don't be mistaken, i love both styles! i'm not part of the whole 2d vs 3d discourse simply because i firmly believe both have their own benefits and limitations. 2d animation brings a sense of uniqueness and artistry to any story due to the distinct drawing from many skilled artists, but it's more limited than 3d when it comes to creating an immersive atmosphere and its respective world. however, the latter is becoming stagnated in its design structure since almost every 3d animated flick visually feels and looks the same.

so, there's no good or bad, right or wrong, better or worse when it comes to animation. i can offer dozens of examples of exceptional, gorgeous-looking, utterly superb animated flicks from both styles, as well as awful, corporate-like films that i try my hardest to forget (looking at you, the emoji movie). fortunately, wolfwalkers belongs to the first group. tomm moore and ross stewart direct an emotionally heartwarming tale with seamless execution of every single aspect. will collins' screenplay isn't particularly new or innovative though. it follows a somewhat generic, predictable story with key plot points that any viewer with minimum viewing experience will see coming from miles away.

however, it's a formula that, if executed properly, still delivers a rich, passionate, captivating narrative, which will always please both children and adults. just from the premise, it's pretty clear that the message of the movie is inspired by cliches such as ""don't judge people by their cover"" or ""our wants can steal someone else's needs"", and it even approaches racial discrimination since the film deals with two different populations. obviously, having in mind one of these ""societies"" is a pack of wolves, there's also a message towards deforestation and excessive animal hunting, leading thousands of species to their eventual extinction. all of these themes are handled brilliantly, and it never feels preachy.

it doesn't matter how unsurprising the story ends up being when i feel as absorbed by the characters and the animation as i did. honor kneafsey and eva whittaker, as robyn goodfellowe and mebh óg mactíre respectively, display phenomenal voice work, which is then elevated by the stunning, expressive, award-worthy animation. sean bean is also terrific as bill goodfellowe, robyn's father, who basically possesses the character arc that goes through the significant change of acknowledging, understanding, and accepting an entirely different culture and its people (in this case, animals). every character is incredibly well-written as are all dialogues, surrounded by a celtic-inspired atmosphere, myths, and obviously, music.

bruno coulais and folk group kíla developed the movie's original score, and it's undoubtedly one of my favorite soundtracks of 2020, including one of my favorite original songs (""running with the wolves"") in one of my favorite musical sequences of the year. ""favorite"" is definitely the right one-word description of how i feel about wolfwalkers. it's one of those films i can't really point out a single flaw. massive praise to the drawing artists who designed such a fantastic 2d world. their work is often unappreciated and underrated (besides being underpaid), so i want to offer cartoon saloon my biggest thank you, and keep making excellent cinema.

i have no doubts: wolfwalkers is, by far and so far, the best animated feature-film i've seen all year. i know the big gun from pixar is coming up (soul), but it will have to be an absolutely perfect movie to surpass tomm moore and ross stewart's beautifully heartwarming celtic-inspired tale. cartoon saloon continues to prove that 2d animation is still capable of delivering emotionally compelling stories through gorgeous-looking, unique, artistic drawings. despite will collins's generic narrative and cliche messages, every single detail is executed perfectly, without a single flaw to point out. outstanding voice work from honor kneafsey and eva whittaker as the well-written, captivating protagonists. however, it's bruno coulais and kíla's original score that melts my heart and sends chills down my spine every time i listen to it. one of my favorite films of the year, i'd be extremely surprised with myself if it doesn't end on my top10. watch it with your family. it's worth it.

7025,"with its multi-layered metaphysical storytelling and rich animation, 'wolfwalkers' is basically the only reason to acknowledge apple tv+ at the moment. it also reaffirms that cartoon saloon makes animated films that culturally literate adults can watch without needing a pint-sized companion as pretext. after watching it, you'll see why the studio is destined to become just as legendary as laika and ghibli.

7026,"according to this movie, thomas edison (maclachlan) and nikola tesla (ethan hawke) were like mozart and salieri if mozart and salieri had been anything like they are portrayed in amadeus – but then tesla has as tenuous a hold on reality as amadeus does, sans all the things that make milos forman's film otherwise great.

this movie derives a sick pleasure from comparing the two inventors, emphasizing edison's failures over tesla's successes – whatever those may have been; i confess that, after seeing the film, i haven't the slightest idea of tesla's achievements, apart from alternating current (which he did not invent) and, apparently, communicating with mars. perhaps it's due to the latter that hawke plays tesla as some kind of alien; a combination of keanu in the day the earth stood still and bowie in the man who fell to earth.

tesla depicts two meetings between the inventors only to admit that neither actually happened. in one of those imaginary encounters, edison apologizes to tesla and tells him that he was wrong about him. what is the point of this? if it is supposed to be a retroactive 'f-you' to edison, methinks he is long past the point of caring.

apart from the historically revisionist chip on its shoulder, tesla is a stylistic disaster. the film is narrated by anne morgan (eve hewson), american financier and banker j.p. morgan's (donnie keshawarz) daughter. in addition to her role in the events of the film, anne appears in cutaways, sitting at a table with a mac computer (?), reporting the respective number of results in a google search for tesla and edison, and telling us to google the american businessman and engineer george westinghouse.

if this weren't strange enough, in the second half of the movie director/screenwriter michael almereyda has hawke stand against a background that is either a matte painting (niagara falls, a field in colorado, a restaurant) or a projection (a pair of horses frolicking in a meadow, to whom hawke offers an apple); this might work in a stage play, or if the entire film consistently followed the same aesthetic, but here it's just another incomprehensible artistic choice.

all of the above, however, is nothing compared to what will go down in history as arguably the lowest point in cinema in the year 2020; ethan hawke as nikola tesla doing a karaoke version of tears for fears' ""everybody wants to rule the world."" this is the exact moment, with about ten minutes to go, when i said ""f this movie"" and never looked back.",low

janicza bravo’s long-awaited star of sundance, _@zola_, could not feel more timely, despite the year-long delay. adapted from the viral twitter thread of 2015 by aziah “zola” king, @zola tells the story of a trip to tampa gone horribly wrong. after a chance meeting in a detroit restaurant, zola (an impeccable taylour paige) agrees to accompany stefani (riley keough), stefani’s roommate x (colman domingo), and stefani’s boyfriend (nicolas braun) on a trip to tampa to earn money by dancing in strip clubs. stefani has done this before and assures zola that she can make really good money. what follows is a nightmare of floridian proportions.",high
7032,"what a terrible movie, i just gave up halfway through. it might have been ok with a decent script, a competent director, and not having a plank of wood in the lead role, but as that's something very different to what we actually got, we'll never know.",low
7035,"very fun, tense thriller that doesn't waste any time. if you've seen leviathan or event horizon or pandorum, you know exactly what this movie is going to be. appreciated the whole cast, and i wish more serious actors would pick up genre roles like this.",high
7043,"bobby de niro's al capone in the untouchables could make you figuratively crap your pants. tom hardy's capone, on the other hand, is the only one soiling his pants – literally. in the godfather, don vito corleone leaves, through luca brassi, a horse's head on jack woltz's bed. in capone, the only thing the titular character leaves in a bed, which happens to be his own, is his dinner – after he has digested it.

the events of capone take place during al capone's final year on earth, when the notorious criminal was “no longer considered a threat” to anyone or anything other than his underwear or his bed sheets. this film is arguably the second lowest point in the al capone mythos, following the mystery of al capone's vaults. not unlike geraldo rivera, capone purports to give us access to the vault that was the mobster's psyche during his last days, and the result is equally disappointing.

in theory no movie should be too bad that includes hardy (or at least the tom hardy i remember from the revenant), kyle maclachlan and matt dillon, but capone gives them very little to do. maclachlan looks as if he got lost on his way to the twin peaks set, dillon wastes his considerable talent on some sort of sixth sense-esque routine, and hardy spends the entire film wearing a prosthetic masks that covers the entire surface of his face and skull, making him look like michael myers in halloween 3000: massacre at the old folks home.

the worst part of the whole thing is that the majority of events in capone take place only in the protagonist's feverish, senile mind, and while there's nothing wrong with a film that reflects the deteriorated mental state of a character – e.g., the machinist –, my problem is that director/writer josh trank has no way of knowing what was going on in al capone's head during his last days of life; in other words, he's making this stuff up as he goes, and this gives the film a double layer of unreality.

put another way, we are dealing with not one, but two levels of fantasy; there's the character's ravings, and then there's the filmmaker's musings as to what the actual person's ravings might have been. we cannot expect to gain any new insights from this approach, and indeed the film fails to reveal anything important or relevant about its subject.",low
7044,"now you might assume that i'm probably not the kind of person predisposed to like this film. daniel doesn't have fun. he writes pages waxing lyrical on a film like 'roma' that starts with a five-minute sequence of someone cleaning up dog poo, or 'a hidden life' that's 60% glorious shots of landscapes. but hey! i can have fun! i loved 'the meg'! i lost my mind in the first transformers film! when the rock rode up a tsunami, avoiding an oil tanker that then took out the golden gate bridge in 'san andreas', i was on my feet in the cinema cheering! this film though? this isn't fun. it's too loud, too hard to follow, too bonkers to be appealing, and not anywhere near bonkers enough to be charming or good for a laugh. it's a film that basically yells at you for an hour and a half in the most aggressive, hyper-masculine way, and leaves you feeling like you've been stuck in a corner at a party for three hours having some guy tell you all about the screenplay he's going to write that will finally, finally be a good video game adaptation and never taking the hint you want a drink or a pee or a change in conversation or to run screaming from the room. i went into paul w. s. anderson's latest film (the guy who made 'mortal combat' and 'death race', not 'boogie nights' and 'punch-drunk love') totally prepared to have a blast, but it gave me no time, space or inclination to do so. and then this stupid film that doesn't know whether it wants to be a bad 'godzilla' or a shitty reimagining of 'the dark tower' has the audacity to set itself up for a sequel! (but hey, we're in the end times, so it only makes sense that we would get a sequel to this trash instead of another season of 'mindhunter'). i'm sure some people are going to get a kick out of this saga about artemis (hunter, of monsters, titular) fighting big asshole spiders and being the saviour white woman to a far more impressive person of colour and crying over some ring (it was for “forever“, remember). for me? the whole thing is too loud and aggressive and dull to be the best kind of dumb fun.

7045,"it appears that this movie is either quite hated or quite liked. i guess it is not that surprising though given that it is based on a video game with a very strong following so if the movie is deviating from canon, and i understand that it does, it will not matter how good or bad a movie is.

well, i have never played the game so i am not burdened with monster hunter canon so i have to say that i very much liked this movie. it does not really hurt that i quite like milla jovovich as well of course. ron perlman is also a favourite of mine and i really wish that he would have been in more of the movie. as it was he was only present briefly at the beginning and then a little bit at the end.

anyway, this is a fantasy, action movie of my liking. clash of cultures, huge monsters and lots and lots of shooting, slicing, kicking and stabbing action. the story is rather simple but not really bad at all. the ships navigating the sand was a bit weird and those huge weapons they were dragging around a bit silly but then those are part of the canon.

at first i got a bit annoyed by artemis and hunter starting to fight each other and thought, oh no, not another one of those silly, illogical stories again, but that sorted itself out rather quickly. and the bait jokes were rather funny actually.

the cgi and the monsters were great, as far as i am concerned. when i first saw the diablos i thought that they had kind of copied the sandworms from dune but when they, or it rather since we only got to see one actually emerge, it was quite different.

the part where artemis is thrown back to earth and followed by the big fire breathing beastie is probably not liked at all by the fans of the video games since it is probably not very canon but i definitely liked it. i whish they would have done a bit more surprise, what the f… and mayhem scenes there actually.

the ending didn’t really leave that much of a conclusion but, unlike what some people seems to feel, i didn’t think it was a bad ending. it certainly prepared the field for a sequel and i for one really hope one will come.",high

we have all watched the dolittle movies starring eddie murphy. i'm not going to lie, i was never a fan of these films. yes, they're purposefully dumb, innocent, and feature that basic level of comedy. they never annoyed me, but they also never did anything remarkably surprising. 2020's version of the known tale is the first post-mcu role of robert downey jr., it boasts an a-list cast, and… it's one of the worst movies of the year, without a single doubt. a complete disaster in every area of filmmaking.

i don't even know where to start. maybe with rdj since he's the most significant negative surprise. i can't believe such a charismatic and now iconic actor like him could deliver a performance this awful. his welsh (?) accent is not only a terrible choice character-wise, but i doubt that any children can understand what he's saying. rdj acts like a baffling caricature of himself, not helping an already flawed film. the voice work from the remaining cast might be the only positive of the whole movie, but the cgi animals are way too unconvincing.

however, as always, the most impactful issues belong to the actual story. instead of being an entertaining and fun adventure, it's an incredibly boring, nonsensical, structure-less journey into one of the most ridiculous third acts of cinema. even placing myself in a child's mind, i don't think i would be able to enjoy this mess of a screenplay. like i wrote above, not even the animals look great…

certain characters possess these unknown relationships that the audience is supposed to care about, but no background is given to any of them. tons of plot points lack a logical explanation. the entire narrative is void of any creativity or uniqueness whatsoever, looking simply like a lazy, unimaginative piece of work. the ""young queen who falls gravely ill"" is just a woman sleeping in bed, not looking ill at all, which proves that not even the makeup department was interested in making an effort.

but all of the issues above are nothing compared to the film's climax. i don't want to spoil anything, so i'll just write that i still can't believe what i witnessed. around ninety minutes of build-up lead to the most shocking, hilarious, utterly absurd moment. the humor is a level below childish. dozens of fart jokes (including one during the climax), over-the-top reactions, and i don't even know what else. between bloodshot, fantasy island, and the grudge… let the devil come and choose!

all in all, dolittle is a massive fail at all levels. it was meant to be one of the worst movies of the year, and it undoubtedly accomplished this goal. from the surprisingly awful performance from robert downey jr. to one of the most shockingly terrible climaxes in the history of cinema, stephen gaghan delivers a structure-less screenplay, filled with nonsensical narrative decisions, and featuring an extremely dull adventure. the cgi animals are far from being remotely impressive, the characters lack personality (bringing an a-list actor doesn't guarantee anything), and the comedy is so astonishingly basic that i doubt kids will laugh at some of the jokes, and they laugh at everything. with a budget of 175m (!!!), it's not understandable how and why a studio would waste this much money on such an obvious flop. the voice work from the cast is good… and it genuinely could have been worse. this is the closest i can get to a positive.

7051,"so pointless, so bad.

the one solace of praise i have for <em>'dolittle'</em> is that it at least mixes things up compared to the eddie murphy remake, as well as potentially the 1967 original - though i haven't seen that, but this sounds a little different based on '67's synopsis.

this film wastes a fantastic cast list. robert downey jr. is of course the lead, but there are also notable appearances from the likes of antonio banderas, michael sheen and jim broadbent - as well as voice roles for the likes of emma thompson, rami malek and octavia spencer. yet, all of those talents are completely wasted - i didn't even recognise some until the end credits.

downey, as the main man, merits the most attention. he is kinda awful, especially with his dreadful attempt at a welsh accent - which is, i'm sure, adr'd in places. it never feels like downey fits as dolittle, a role which comes across as perfect for johnny depp; though i'm glad it didn't fall to him, given how poor this is.

the special effects are passable, but not as great as you'd expect from a 2020 (2018? 2019?) film with this budget and production company. the plot is ok, but it's all just a bit limp unfortunately. it needed strong humour, which it didn't get.

no idea why they chose to remake this but here we are. very poor, in my opinion anyway.",low
7054,"there is a moment midway through this film where you can suddenly feel everything clicking into place. up until this point, the film has been entertaining, with some great set pieces and a scope that is trademark nolan, but the central hook of the film - “time inversion” - has felt almost superfluous to the plot, albeit a clever visual conceit that gives the film a different vibe to your average spy thriller. but then comes the “moment” - a simple act of crossing a threshold - where suddenly you realise how the visual conceit is going to figure into the rest of the film and also how most of the first hour has been pure setup for what is to follow. it’s the kind of twist that isn’t really a twist at all as it is a visual explanation that the film has really been waiting for. nolan has taken quite a gamble in delaying this “moment” for so long and there is always the feeling the film is hiding elements of the plot in the first half. this means the explanation may have come too late for some to invest in the film fully, but if you are still with it, there is a sudden feeling of exhilaration of knowing to an extent some of what is about to follow and the film lets loose with some fantastic set pieces that are hugely satisfying if you have been paying attention.

performances are great, with branagh in full scenery chewing mode and the score is suitably zimmeresque and loud. it doesn’t quite hit the highs of its closest cousin - inception - but it’s scope is similarly impressive and it’s going to lead to plenty of theories and explanations in order to follow each major character’s journey through the film. great stuff in the end, but it was touch and go there for a while.",high

watching _tenet_, the latest film from writer/producer/director christopher nolan (_memento_; _inception_; _interstellar_), i was reminded of an apocryphal story about nasa – during the space race, in an attempt to tackle the problem of how to write in zero gravity, nasa poured millions into developing the fisher space pen, whereas the russians simply gave their cosmonauts pencils. and it seems to me watching this overblown mess of a film that nolan has become so fixated on the grandiosity of the pen that he has completely overlooked the humble pencil. more so than any of his previous work, _tenet_ is focused on mixing philosophy and real(ish) science with over-the-top mainstream entertainment to such an extent that he ignores such basic narrative principles as character arcs, empathy, motivation, and interiority. now, don't get me wrong, i love filmic experimentation (two of my favourite directors are terrence malick and david lynch), but _tenet_ isn't an especially experimental film – it's a humourless and badly written shambles, convinced of its own portentousness, and created by a man who has achieved such popularity that it seems no one in his circle is willing to tell him when something is a bad idea.

spending almost ten years working on the story, and five writing the script, in tenet, nolan is yet again examining the vagaries of time. it's a theme that's front and centre in _memento_ (2000), _inception_ (2010), _interstellar_ (2014), and _dunkirk_ (2017), and to a lesser extent in _following_ (1998) and _the prestige_ (2006) (i haven't seen any of his _dark knight_ trilogy so i can't attest to their thematic concerns, and we shall not speak of his remake of _insomnia_). it's undeniably fascinating to see a tent pole hollywood production engaging with issues such as entropy, thermodynamics, reversibility and irreversibility, time's arrow, the grandfather paradox, and t-symmetry, all the while keeping proceedings housed firmly within the spy genre (it's a bond movie in all but name). indeed, one of the film's central questions is especially noteworthy – if what and who we remember from our past defines who we are in our present, do things that haven't happened to us yet also speak to our identity? do our future actions determine who we are as much as our past actions? it's a fascinating question. and one with which nolan does precisely nothing. however, the film's main problems aren't related to the squandered existential potential, the much-ballyhooed complexity, the puzzle-like structure, the philosophical musing, or the thematic similarity to nolan's previous work. rather, they are more fundamental, existing almost entirely at a structural level (although some of the performances don't help matters, nor does the abysmal sound mixing). the film looks incredible, the practical effects in the action scenes are extraordinarily mounted, the cinematography is stunning, and the editing is superb, but there simply isn't anything of note under the shiny veneer. it's a film with virtually no interest in human beings.

the premise of _tenet_ is straightforward in outline. the film opens as a cia operative known only as the protagonist (john david washington) infiltrates a team of bad guys looking to find a spy at the kiev opera house. he finds the man before they do, but during their escape, he sees something which should be impossible – a bullet seems to travel backwards in space and a bullet hole is ""un-shot"", as if time is reversed for that bullet, even though everything else is moving normally. the protagonist is able to smuggle the spy outside, but their escape goes awry, and to avoid being captured, he swallows a cyanide tablet. rather than dying, however, he awakens to be told that he has passed the test to join an ultra-secret international espionage squad known as tenet. his mission is fairly simply – at some point in the future, someone has figured out how to reverse the entropy of objects, effectively being able to send them back along the timeline without having to reverse time itself. the implications of this are catastrophic and have set humanity on course for world war iii, and probable extinction, unless the protagonist can figure out who is doing it and put a stop to their machinations. along the way, he makes the acquaintance of neil (robert pattinson), his infinitely better-informed handler; andrei sator (a spectacularly miscast kenneth branagh giving new meaning to clichéd villainy), a dangerous russian oligarch; kat barton (elizabeth debicki), andrei's oppressed and deeply unhappy trophy wife; priya (dimple kapadia), an arms dealer; ives (aaron taylor-johnson), a tenet soldier; michael crosby (michael caine), a british intelligence bigwig; and barbara (clémence poésy), a scientist specialising in all things temporal.

_tenet_ is an event movie in every way; this 150-minute, $200m+ original idea (when was the last time a non-franchise, non-comic book original movie got that kind of budget) is a massive studio tent pole written and directed by the most popular filmmaker alive. and i will say this. the budget is on the screen. oftentimes, you'll see a movie that's cost a ridiculous amount and you'll sit there thinking, ""they must have spent a lot on catering."" with _tenet_, however, it's all there, front and centre. no small amount of that money, of course, must have gone on the practical effects (incredibly, the film has only 280 vfx shots) – whether it be our heroes bungie-jumping onto the side of a building, a close-quarters fight where one of the combatants moves in reverse, a boeing 747 jet crashing into a building (which was shot for real), a highway chase where some of the cars are going forward in time and others are going backwards, or an all-out battle scene where, again, some of the soldiers travel forward whilst others move in reverse. even ludwig göransson's score gets in on the act, employing only melodies which sound the same whether played backwards or forwards.

as cinematic spectacle goes (on a purely visual level), i've never quite seen anything like it. it's one of those films where you'll genuinely be asking yourself, ""how the hell did they do that?""; a question that's become increasingly rare in our cgi-reliant times. tenet looks like it was an exceptionally difficult movie to make. along the same lines, the cinematography by the great hoyte van hoytema (_the fighter_; _spectre_; _ad astra_) is stunning, with van hoytema mixing 15-perf 70mm imax film (shot at 1.43:1; projected at 1.90:1) with traditional 70mm stock (2.20:1) and a few 35mm sequences in a manner where the shifts in aspect ratio are barely noticeable (although i saw it on an imax screen; aspects shifts would be more obvious on a smaller screen). it's the kind of film that could only exist in the medium of cinema – no other artform could even begin to approximate its aesthetic design and splendour, and i admire that a great deal. a celluloid purist, nolan has always made a big stink about the artistic importance of cinema, and _tenet_ finds him pushing the aesthetic boundaries of what the artform can accomplish, foregrounding innovation in ways that big budget mainstream studio productions simply don't, and celebrating the possibilities it affords those with sufficient enough imagination.

unfortunately, no matter how visually unique or aesthetically impressive it may be, no amount of gloss can hide the fact that the screenplay is a turgid mess and suffers from some fundamental problems – most notably, it's bereft of emotion and populated with cardboard cut-outs that are supposed to be characters. the problems start early when the protagonist is told that the future of humanity depends on his mission. this is precisely when i started to tune out. any film that declares its story is none-other than saving humanity has gone so big as to render the people who populate its narrative as insignificant. it's also a cliché, it's dull as dishwater, and we've seen it done a million-and-one-times. the idea of saving all mankind simply doesn't pack any kind of emotional punch any more, far better to stay smaller and focus on character.

which brings me to those characters. good lord, they're badly written. the protagonist isn't a person with an interiority; he's a cipher, the audience's surrogate so that nolan can explain the plot to us. but there's nothing more to him – he's utterly emotionless, seemingly void of any kind of relatable motivation, has no psychological through line, and nothing even resembling a character arc. i'm not a huge fan of washington in general, who i feel has played every part in the same sombre, disinterested manner, so there could be some prejudice at work, but i am a huge fan of branagh, and he's even worse. think of the most clichéd russian villain you've ever seen. now square that and you'll be some way towards imagining how ludicrous sator is. he isn't a person – he's a collection of near-satirical tics, clichés, and elements from other, better films. maybe with a more menacing actor in the role it might have worked, but all i could think whenever he was on screen was ""that accent is hilarious."" pattinson's neil and debicki's kat fair better, but neither set the screen alight. along the same lines, much of the second half of the film hinges on the fact that the protagonist and kat find themselves drawn to one another, yet washington and debicki have zero chemistry. at a human level, there's nothing to take a hold of the audience, nothing to make us care about any of these people; they're gears in the machinery of nolan's plot.

speaking of kat, a common criticism of nolan's filmography as a whole is that his female characters tend to be victims whose deaths motivate men or who need saving by men, and/or women who define themselves almost entirely in terms of their relationship to men. now, i'm not saying that nolan is _obliged_ to write more rounded female characters. he isn't. much like one of his favourite filmmakers, michael mann, nolan's films are androcentric. and there's nothing wrong with that. however, in mann, there are to be found strong female characters with considerable agency, whereas in _tenet_, kat is nothing more than a pawn in a game played by powerful men who effortlessly control her. she defines herself almost entirely in terms of her role as a self-sacrificing mother, and whilst this is an interesting trait the first couple of times it comes up, by the time nolan is reminding us of how much she has sacrificed for the 237th time, it had become obvious that this was going to be the extent of her characterisation.

at one point early in the film, barbara tells the protagonist, ""_don't try to understand it, just feel it_"", which is advice that nolan is also offering to his audience. the problem is that there's nothing to feel. _tenet_ is a puzzle, the impenetrability of which will depend on each individual viewer (and how much of the appallingly poorly-mixed dialogue you can make out), but unlike _memento_ (which remains nolan's best by a long way), which packed a seriously emotional gut-punch when we finally learn what was at the heart of the puzzle, _tenet_ offers us nothing more than the task of deciphering it for its own sake. there's a twist towards the end that i literally saw coming from about 10 minutes in, but aside from that, there's no payoff. there's nothing to make us want to penetrate a story that seems more intent on reminding us how clever it is instead of trying to depict real people or establish real emotional stakes; it's a film more enamoured by the complexity of its own design than by any of the people contained within. it's an emotional void – all technical virtuosity and surface sheen with next to nothing at its core.",low

the movie is just so boooooring and nonsensical.

below are my notes when watching this movie (i had to do something while watching it to not get bored out of my mind) which pretty much speaks for itself.

what is it with the stupid beginning? it was just silly lecturing and did not really bring anything to the story.

those clowns pretending to be robbers. was it supposed to be funny? well it was not. bad start indeed.

25% and this is boring.

40% and this is still f... boring.

a guy used to fly ancient propeller planes can suddenly fly jet fighter planes. and she ""forgot"" about radar? seriously?

flying straight through exploding fireworks and no one saw them nor did the engines get clogged up? and did they not have a world to save instead of sightseeing by the way?

a fighter jet flying from the us to cairo in one go? yeah, right!

finally at 60% there is some action which is of course dragged down by this silly wish stone's impact on wonder woman.

and here we go with the illogical emotional bullshit refusing to accept reality.

my god, the bad guy is such an unintelligent and stupid jerk. no charisma whatsoever. the script is really such a juvenile piece of crud that it is unbelievable.

85% and finally some superhero action. pretty lousy action but at least some action.

holy crap! even the finale is boring and dragged out.

produced by the same company that works on the james bond films, the rhythm section went through tough production issues. blake lively injured herself on set, consequently delaying the movie until the end of 2019, and then again to the well-known ""trash month"", so obviously, my expectations were quite low. it's the first time i watch a feature film directed by reed morano, as well as mark burnell, who makes his debut as a screenwriter. as usual, the only thing i knew about the movie was its synopsis and crew, but i also caught the overwhelmingly negative feedback from critics and audiences alike...

while its flaws are undeniable (and i'll get there), i don't find reed morano's film to be worthy of belonging in january with so many worse movies. sean bobbitt's cinematography is a technical standout, by delivering two fantastic one-take action sequences (one of which is edited to feel like one take), and some wide shots look genuinely stunning. i always love when a film is set in actual cities or remote locations since these offer a realistic atmosphere, and given the right treatment in post-production, the tone can be better controlled by the environment surrounding the characters.

the cast is also really good. blake lively delivers one of the best performances of her career, definitely the most somber one. her character is constantly placed in challenging situations, physically and emotionally. blake incorporates stephanie's state of mind seamlessly, carrying the narrative forward even when the latter fails to captivate the viewer. jude law is jude law, and sterling k. brown offers a notable display as well. however, the positives end here.

story-wise, the rhythm section lacks creativity and uniqueness. besides being way too straightforward and predictable for an action-drama with a central mystery, it's edited (joan sobel) in such an uncommon manner that makes the movie feel incredibly tiresome. tons of moments are drawn out for extra seconds or even minutes. almost every scene weirdly goes on for far too long. there's no new information to transmit to the viewer, nothing is happening... the whole film is edited like this, consequently ending with almost fifteen/twenty minutes of nothing. also, some dialogue scenes are intercut with something that's going to happen after that particular conversation, which is confusing in the sense that the viewer doesn't know where the focus is supposed to be on.

then, the actual narrative raises tons of logical questions. i hate to be ""that guy"" who nitpicks character decisions or plot points like cinemasins (even though this channel makes so for comedy purposes), but this movie really makes the viewer wonder ""how/why the hell is she able to do this?!"" stephanie is trained to be an agent, and while a specific part of her training is straight-up impossible, i believe that the character possesses the required skills. my issue is that she barely uses anything that she learned: she continuously runs away from everyone and everything and she gets other innocent people dead in her partially failed missions.

in addition to her, there are other characters with either unclear motivations or questionable lifestyles, having in mind that this film deals with secret intelligence, terrorism, and stuff that very few people have access to or knowledge of. the score also feels extremely awkward. similar to the editing issue, the song selection doesn't fit the dark, depressing tone that the movie carries. sometimes, stephanie is about to go on a serious mission, and upbeat pop music is playing... why?

all in all, the rhythm section isn't as awful as most january films, it certainly doesn't deserve the record of the worst opening weekend of all-time, but it still carries tons of issues. the editing (joan sobel) is weirdly unconventional, drawing out scenes for extra seconds or even minutes where absolutely nothing happens and intercutting dialogue sequences with unnecessary flashbacks or flashforwards. reed morano isn't able to bring creativity or anything remotely original to her movie, and mark burnell writes a predictable screenplay packed with questionable plot points and logical issues, not helping the already dull pacing. steve mazzaro's score doesn't fit the tone of the film, but sean bobbitt's cinematography delivers a couple of surprising action sequences and some neat wide shots. the cast is really good, and if not for an outstanding blake lively, this movie would have been a lot worse.

7101,"w.c. fields said you should never work with children or animals. thanks to cgi technology, you don’t have to anymore – at least not with animals. buck, the main dog in the call of the wild, appears to be a cross between beethoven and roger rabbit. like the former, buck destroys or eats everything in his path, and like the latter, it’s painfully clear that the human actors are interacting with an animated character – the difference being that roger rabbit is actually supposed to be a cartoon.

buck’s not alone, though. in the yukon, he and a husky have a fight that plays like the doggy version of 300. the advantage of using computer generated animals – not only the dogs but also wolves, rabbits, etc. – is that you don't have to worry about aspca or peta. the downside, however, is that the audience doesn't worry either about what happens to these creatures, because it’s blatantly obvious that they're not real; moreover, not only are they not there, but there isn’t even a ‘there’ for them to be, since the entire world around them – snow, trees, rivers, even the horizon – is equally fake-looking. this should have been a fully animated movie; it still would have looked awful, being computer-animated, but at least it would have been consistent.

buck’s problem, of course, goes beyond appearances; on top of not looking like an actual dog, he doesn’t act like one either. for example, he takes harrison ford’s whiskey bottle away from him and refuses to give it back – pray tell, how exactly does buck know that drinking’s bad for ya? in general, buck is as good a judge of character as dogs usually are in the movies – and only in the movies; if that were also the case in real life, hitler and blondi would not have been as happy together as they indeed were.

if a dog looks like a dog, behaves like a dog, and is in fact a dog to whom things happen that would realistically happen to a dog, we can’t help but care about him the same way we care about bresson’s donkey in au hasard balthazar. you don’t have to actually put the animal in harm’s way – that’s why they invented animatronics, after all –; just make sure we can believe that there’s something tangible at stake, and suspension of disbelief will do the rest.",low

i... am... in shock. the turning had tons of development issues, switching directors (juan carlos fresnadillo was the first choice), cast, producers (steven spielberg was once responsible for the project), and who knows what else. it's yet another adaptation of the famous ghost story, turn of the screw by henry james, so it was always going to be a challenging task to bring a horror flick with something unique that the others didn't possess. after so many changes, the film finally decided on mackenzie davis as the adult protagonist, and finn wolfhard and brooklynn prince as the young kids.

they replaced everything and everyone, except the people who are behind the main reason why this movie fails so miserably: the screenwriters. with all due respect to the hayes brothers, but this is the worst kind of a bad film. it doesn't have a single redeemable quality about it. it's a movie about... nothing! it has no message, no purpose, no structure, and last but not least: there's no ending. i'm not joking, the turning doesn't have an ending. it's like someone abruptly shouts ""roll credits"" way before any sort of payoff is delivered.

the whole film is a collection of repetitive, dull scenes that only vary in location. scareless and predictable jump scare sequences spread throughout the entire runtime with no meaning or objective underneath. close to ninety minutes of build-up to utterly nothing. this isn't one of those cases where the ending is just ambiguous, and people can interpret it in several ways. as baffling as it might sound, this monotonous, cliche, boring horror movie doesn't possess an ending. i have to repeat it, so you actually believe what i'm writing.

even if i simply ignore that last (nonexistent) act, the rest of the film is still awful. as the viewer, knowing more than the main character about what's happening or what's about to unravel is almost always a lousy aspect concerning the horror genre. not only there's a lack of a scary or eerie environment, but the narrative raises dozens of logical questions that eventually get no answer. the movie actually starts reasonably okay, it got me slightly invested in davis' character, but it quickly becomes one of the most yawning-inducing experiences i've had this year.

usually, i can turn to the acting to help me get through the hardest portions of the film. however, mackenzie davis (who i liked a lot in terminator: dark fate) gradually starts to become uninteresting, and finn wolfhard delivers the worst performance i've ever seen from him. brooklynn prince is good for her age, but she's still a 9-year-old kid, so... you know. barbara marten is probably the best as mrs. grose, but just like the movie itself, she has no real impact on anything. technically, the score is weird, and instead of elevating the scary sequences, it turns them into a rock concert. the editing also lacks consistency.

honestly, i thought that fantasy island was a safe bet for the ""worst movie of 2020"" prize, but the turning just entered the race. as logically absurd as the former might be, at least it has an ending. it's a ridiculous one, but it's, in fact, an ending. the latter not only lacks a payoff to the ninety minutes of build-up, but it has absolutely no redeeming quality. describing a film in a one-word sentence was never this easy: ""nothing"". it's a movie about nothing! no meaning, no message, no purpose, no logical sense. an extremely boring journey through a mansion with predictable jump scares, an awkward score, and disappointing acting. it's an emotionless story packed with unanswered questions, and no, it's not one of those ""ambiguous narrative"" cases. i definitely don't recommend it, unless you desire that frustration of watching an incomplete film.

7104,"the turn of the screw, a book written by henry james, is considered one of the most influential gothic horror books ever written, which, in turn, gave rise to one of the most influential classics of cinematic terror: the innocents (1961). of course, when hearing rumors of a possible new adaptation of this classic work, a person tends to fear the worst, as it will be difficult to achieve the splendor of the original film. in this way, can chill be at the level of the original? the answer is a round no, this film only serves to confirm the initial fear caused by the announcement of this new adaptation. 

i'm not going to lie, the film manages to build a gothic atmosphere, out of a tale from the era, with beautiful cinematography, centered on the house and the estate and its eminent threat to the new tenant. however, atmosphere, a decent performance and a promising start cannot save the film from a confused and uninspired script.

the skeleton of the original work remains (although, for no apparent reason, it happens now during the 90s), a young caretaker is called to work in the decrepit and old bly mansion, a mansion inhabited by two brothers whose parents died, miles (who in this version, loses any kind of threat adjacent to her character) and flora, and by a maid in charge of looking after orphans. after a few days at the mansion, the janitor begins to experience paranormal phenomena.

however, and unlike the original film, this new version of the events is not built with the same type of ambiguity as to the existence of frightening phenomena, it does not use psychological terror in a really effective way, considering itself more intelligent than in the reality is. the film introduces some interesting ideas, but lets them fall into the deepest clichés of the genre (like the use of jump scares), and apart from one or the other chilling sequence, the film just doesn't know how to be scary.

one of the biggest problems in the film is the use of special effects on ghosts, which remove any kind of frightening effect that simplicity could have offered them, and which make the few ghost appearances ineffective. given that the appearances are sporadic and the characters relatively uninteresting, the pace at which the film goes also suffers during its duration, as it drags mainly in the middle, where little happens and the disinterest begins to be felt by the cinema.

i must add that never in cinema did i visualize such a pretentious ending, without any kind of nexus or logic and that invalidates the entire trip that had been completed throughout the film. it was not a deserved ending, it was just an attempt to give rise to the ambiguity felt in the original, it was an ending indicator that my time had been wasted watching this film, which is nothing more than a confusing narrative.

on the whole, the turning is a film that just isn't worth it, and if it weren't for the fact that it had a beautiful cinematography, a well-built atmosphere, some decent interpretations and a clear effort behind the making, it would really be worthy of a star.",low
7105,"the dead of winter is the time studios like to shove their bottom-basement junk into theaters, bringing us movies that are instantly forgettable and brimming with mediocrity. the female-driven buddy comedy “like a boss” is a great example. this tolerable movie is perfectly fine for a mindless girls’ night out, but it never sets its standards high enough to achieve much more. but why would it?

best friends mia (tiffany haddish) and mel (rose byrne) are living their best lives running a makeup company they’ve built from the ground up. things haven’t been going so well on the financial front, and the women find themselves over their heads in debt. when cosmetics industry titan claire luna (salma hayek) presents them with a huge buyout offer, it puts a strain on their friendship that the two may not ever be able to repair.

if you’re looking for a fun and insightful view at the real-life experience of female business owners, you won’t find it here. what you will find is yet another male-written movie that feeds the narrative that the beauty industry equals female empowerment. it’s not offensive, but it’s a stale idea. how many movies can you count that use the old “you need makeup to feel pretty, but also never forget to be yourself!” narrative? it’s not offensive, but it’s another hollywood rubber stamp on what the industry thinks are the ingredients necessary for a movie that’s supposed to be made for women.

the comedy is sometimes funny but mostly strained, as haddish and byrne are constantly struggling in an effort to sell the lousy one-liners. their chemistry is terrific, but there’s only so much these two talented ladies can do with such a lackluster script. hayek is an over-the-top caricature who is given very little to do. her shtick can be amusing in the right place at the right time, but it isn’t here.

this isn’t a terrible movie, but it’s light years away from being an instant classic. in fact, this tired effort wouldn’t even orbit the general conversation. but “like a boss” is still just barely good enough if you are a fan of the two leads or if you’re looking for easy-to-swallow entertainment.",low

this type of movie is always rather divisive between critics and audiences simply due to its nature. story-wise, it's never groundbreaking or innovative in any shape or form. these apocalyptic films always follow a formulaic screenplay, packed with logical inconsistencies, but also with tons of thrilling action. visuals vary in quality depending on the studio, as well as sound design and other technical aspects. i always try my best to accept *everything* these movies throw irrationally at the viewer. i prepare myself to be as open-minded as i can, and usually, i have no issues with that (actually, i find the ""that's not how science works"" argument a bit nitpicky in this subgenre).

however, greenland fails to deliver the only thing i did expect from it: a planet-killer comet of pure popcorn entertainment. the only positive aspects are the cast and two/three sequences genuinely exciting. gerard butler is already used to this sort of film (has fallen series, geostorm), so he has no problems in portraying another thin character with no real motivations or depth. same goes for morena baccarin, who simply plays the wife of butler. both deliver good performances, enough to keep me engaged until the end of the flick.

the few good sequences are really good. little scraps of the giant comet hit earth before the extinction-level event, and these look great. nevertheless, just this for a 119-minute runtime is far from being satisfying. as expected, chris sparling's screenplay is as generic as it could be, just like ric roman waugh's direction, which doesn't really offer anything remotely new. some narrative decisions (not related to science or technology because these i just accepted as part of the usual illogical stuff) are definitely to pass the time since they have no consequences whatsoever. greenland is precisely like dozens of other movies in the subgenre, but without the technical aspects that end up elevating the overall picture.

the vfx look dated in some sequences, almost like they didn't have enough time (or money) to finish them. i mean, a static image of a meteorite shower as the sky? really? sadly, this comes across as amateur and lazy. the absence of a powerful score (david buckley) makes the action scenes feel ""empty"", like something is missing. a few fighting moments are pretty much impossible to see clearly due to the overly dark environment and choppy editing (gabriel fleming). overall, the action walks the line between decent and terrible.

however, the most significant ""slap in the face"" is the planet-killer comet that everyone is going to look forward to as soon as they enter the theater. there's no way of working around this: if an entire film builds up a third act's massive comet of the side of europe, it must show it hit the ground in all of its splendor. the gigantic explosion of ridiculous proportions, the endless smoke that fills up the whole atmosphere, the distinctive sound of the impact... this is the moment that can make or break any apocalyptic movie. unfortunately, and i'm only going to write this, it broke.

in the end, greenland is predictably underwhelming, packing only a couple of genuinely exciting sequences, and a decent cast. gerard butler and morena baccarin try, but they're not enough to compensate for everything else. as expected, chris sparling's formulaic screenplay doesn't add a unique storyline or innovative aspect to the genre, as well as ric roman waugh's basic direction. this would all be fine if the action delivered what most people want to see, but sadly, this component is also quite a letdown. despite a few occasional, riveting scenes, the entertainment levels are pretty low due to the unimpressive visual effects, lack of a powerful score, and poor editing, culminating in a ""viewing-killer"" disappointment. if you absolutely love apocalyptic films, maybe you'll find something enjoyable about it that i didn't. however, if this type of movie doesn't suit your preferences, then this one surely isn't going to convert you.

7138,"liberal snooty types lashing out at conservative cronies and their right-wing leanings should have made for some enjoyably edgy satire, but 'the hunt' is merely a by-the-numbers comedy-horror-suspense thriller that has a few punchy moments. but, if production company blumhouse wants to remake a bunch of 90s jean-claude van damme action movies with betty gilpin in the lead role, i think i'd be down with that. i'd watch them, not in the theatres obviously, but late at night after a few beers.

7140,"> review from **_horror focus_**

gaining its momentum back in mid 2019, the hunt stirred up quite a bit of controversy prior to its initial release, branding it too brutal for release due to the mass shootings in ohio, texas last summer. this blumhouse picture was later rescheduled, and was at one point never to see the light of day, which would have been a crushing blow knowing how relevant this actually turned out to be. luckily for us, blumhouse soon caught on and realised movies like the hunt are exactly what our cruel audience’s need right now, something with a sharp satirical bite with a gut-punching narrative reflective of modern society. welcome to my favourite horror movie of the past few years.

imagine a twitter thread was made into a movie, this is the hunt. what we have here is a film that functions on the confliction that exists in the real-world between liberals and conservatives, as they take chunks out of each other when discussing politics online, spilling blood on each side as opinions and views are torn to shit by the opposing party. what is depicted is literal death and carnage, which is representative of how the different identities and political views that are one person's beliefs, but another’s infuriating joke.
image result for the hunt 2020 film
the beauty here (which is addressed as a massive concern to most reviewers) is the lack of depth to these characters within the hunt, and to their lifestyle choices and political standpoints. what works best is that it never takes a stance when mocking both sides of the political spectrum, and allows us as an audience to identify which whatever our political views lead us to, even if one side is draped in murderous overtones. i admire how we are left to decide where we would stand, and if what is happening is something we can sympathise with. to most, what i’m saying sounds ridiculous, but this lack of depth to these characters is very much reflective on the current state of our social media, having people who we know nothing about spreading their views which are toxic to half and relatable to others.

it’s that online façade that is at play here, as we witness comments and statements daily that tear down others, ruin people’s professional statuses or simply to spread offensive and insensitive comments online to troll others. this is the world we live in, and the characters in the hunt exist within our real world. the characters within this may not be fleshed out, but to the online profiles with nothing but a name, a picture and a flurry of controversial tweets neither are they, and that certainly looks like modern day humanity to me.

much of the hunt’s satirical sting comes from its reliance on our current climate and political correctness, which leans on its accurate depiction of society to get its laughs in when it can. it’s understandable that this particular sense of humour might to a little too one-note for some, but it firmly has its own tongue planted in its cheek when openly mocking our current way of thinking, juxtaposing these characters with opposing mind-sets to create a genuinely clever and on-the-nose depiction on humanity’s contemporary views. aside from the intelligent links to modern society, it’s also really enjoyable and highly entertaining when utilised to its full potential. one could be offended by some of the humour here, but when the film itself jokes on our own generation of snowflakes, it begs the question if the hunt is pointing the finger at you, and calling you out for being said snowflake. it all really works for me on a sharply pungent level, one that had me tickled pink until the final credits. the hunt ultimately holds up a darkly comedic mirror up to the political divisions in a way that hasn’t been explored to this stature.
image result for the hunt 2020
the action here is outstanding, with the violence being the appropriate level of over the top to match its exuberant premise. betty giplin is undeniably outstanding as she delivers a powerhouse of a performance in her portrayal of crystal, a tough as nails heroine who easily establishes herself in the ranks next to such genre greats as erin from you’re next and alien’s ripley. her level of badass is contagiously ferocious, making every scene she’s in an absolute blast to witness. each fight scene is crafted brilliantly, looking seamlessly effortless with its high-energy intensity, most notably when we reach our final act in which our million dollar baby hillary swank comes head-to-head with giplin, which can only be described as one of the most entertaining fight scenes in recent horror memory.

nothing is ever fully dripping in suspense, but you soon realise it doesn’t need to be when you’re watching enigmatic fight scenes that are as vicious as they are diverting. the film also works its best when it plays at its most unexpected, knocking familiar faces off like drew barrymore in scream level of unexpected in ways so gleefully gory it will have you laughing with sheer shock. the hunt may split audiences right down the middle, but there is one thing that is universal, and that’s that betty giplin’s crystal is already this decades best final girl.

verdict 
proving to be one of the strongest contemporary social and political horror movies in recent memory, the hunt is a lean, mean, fighting machine that is as sharply satirical as it is viciously violent. make room for betty giplin, our new final girl is in town.

7144,"fantastic watch, will watch again, and do recommend.

this is one of the best, if weirdly refreshing movies i've seen in quite some time.  i'm a sucker for a good survival movie, and this is an ""elites hunt people for sport"" trope mixed with a good mystery plot if there ever was one.  the story structure alone is worth the watch as it essentially runs 3 (-4) sequential stories to tell one overall story while telling you about the story structure.  some movies clearly put a lot of effort into keeping you on your toes, this movie just does it.

not only is the gunfighting immaculate, but the combat action sequences are amazing.  betty gilpin steals the show every time she's on screen, and i would normally say she's the one that carries the movie, but the movie is good enough that even though she's over the top great, i can't say the movie needs her to carry it.

there is an investigative aspect of the movie that is very intriguing, but that is given in the ""why are they doing this to us"" of it all, but unless the villains give an ""evil speech"", then it should be expected.

if you enjoy human vs human survival situations, then i think you will be pleasantly surprised by this one.",high
7146,"basically, there are a ton of 1 star reviews on imdb complaining that it makes the left look bad... despite, you know, things like antifa and their belief that a red hat means they gt to physically assault people.

so i am going to give it 10 stars... because my wife had a milk shake thrown at her for being a ""race traitor"" and, on our way back from work we got egged (along with everyone else at a red light) in an attempt to convince us to support impeachment.

and, because of that i think that this works as a satire about that attitude that having a different opinion means they have the right to act violently, by taking that attitude to an extreme.

and when reviewers write sentences like ""insipid portrayals of both the elite and the deplorables"" it only serves to reinforce the attitude that the film is parodying, that attitude that they are ""elite"" elevated above all others, and those in the out group are dehumanized as ""deplorable.""

in fact, the vast majority of the 1 star reviews are written with a vocabulary that so perfectly echoes the people that the film is a satire of that it is almost impossible not to see the brilliance here.

""elite"" and ""deplorable"" a part of me thinks that they realize that they are the subject of satire in this film... but can't seem to avoid acting exactly like the people that are being mocked here.

so, congratulations, language of the negative reviews alone make this a brilliant satire.",high
7156,"the tax collector is the second-best david ayer-directed film (the best remains end of watch), but it's far from the best david ayers-penned movie – though to be fair, that includes training day and dark blue, as well as the aforementioned end of watch.

the script can be nicely subtle, especially when it comes to the character of creeper (shia labeouf putting his natural weirdness to good use); he's always impeccably dressed in a suit and tie, but his cauliflower ears are a dead giveaway – here's someone who can take punishment as well as dish it out.

this is great stuff, but at some point you gotta put your money where your mouth is, and that's where the character shortchange us. much is made of how creeper has maimed, tortured, and murdered hundreds of people, but in the course of the film he only fires his gun once, and then in self-defense; on the other hand, he's given a martyr's death, but i'm not sure whether we're supposed to feel bad for him or not. if all that's said of him is true, he has it coming to him; if not, we've been fed a line of bullsh*t.

having said that, the script can also be painfully unsubtle, in particular when it's trying to convince us that the protagonist, david cuevas (bobby soto), is a killer with a heart of gold (talk about a crock of sh*t) – a family man who prays before every meal and advises creeper to accept christ in his heart, as opposed to antagonist conejo (josé martín), who engages in human sacrifices and voodoo rituals.

that's pretty black-and-white, when it should be shades-of-gray; in other words, the tax collector's problem is that it insists on splitting its characters into 'bad guys' and 'good guys' when 'bad guys' and 'worse guys' would be a more accurate division.",low

7163,"**summary**  
i had decently high hopes for this, given it is my favorite genre and train to busan was pretty good. however, this was a major disappointment.

**the good**  
the plot, set four years in the future from train to busan and decent build-up with ok back story to most things going on. general atmosphere is also nice.

**the bad**  
giant plot holes, some so large and obvious it is almost impossible to enjoy the movie.

vehicle cgi, especially the physics. it is so bad my dead dog would make it better. to make matters worse these scenes make up for an unreasonably large portion of the movie. i got seriously angry watching it, and i love zombies and car chases.

the violently over dramatic ending. this is comedy level shit, even if the rest of the movie was good, this would have destroyed it.",low

train to busan is one of my favorite south korean films ever, and i firmly defend that it's one of the best zombie apocalypse movies of all-time, maybe even the best. therefore, i couldn't help but feel incredibly excited about another installment set in the same world. it's not a direct sequel to the original's story, but it seems to be placed just after the pandemic began. unfortunately, it ends up being a huge disappointment.

despite the jaw-dropping stunt work and the extremely intense action sequences, the reason why peninsula's predecessor works so well is due to its focus on the characters. by giving them a compelling development and a strong emotional bond, the zombie outbreak becomes instantly more effective because of our immense concern for everyone involved. every technical element is dialed up to its maximum, transforming the film into an emotionally devastating, heart-wrenching story.

yeon sang-ho tries to follow a shortcut to achieve that same emotion of his previous movie, dooming this ""sequel"" from the very beginning. every relationship feels forced, and the supposedly heartbreaking decisions/events are a complete target miss. even the action scenes fail to live up to the original's level due to excessive cgi in ridiculous car chases. every fifteen minutes, a major logical issue arises, and some characters are either straight-up dumb or unbelievably smart for their age/experience. peninsula takes the realistic environment established by train to busan and fictionalizes it way too much.

while very stylized, the animation quality is excellent, but between bigfoot having magic powers, having passed them to his son, the wife not being able to speak to animals (thus being left out of half their life), the weirdness of bigfoot being an absent father, and the better movie that we skipped, there is a lot to be desired, very early in the movie.

i had hoped that the bigger plot would out weigh all the negative nuances, but it just didn't happen.

it's also a weird contrast of child focused presentation with an very extended murder plot:  there's a corporations are earth murderers message that hits the audience like a frying pan, and it's just not fun enough to cover it.  maybe for young audiences.",low
7176,"when i saw the previews for this latest interpretation of jane austen’s emma, i envisioned a reimagining of the classic, with the plot or the setting radically changed with creative license applied liberally throughout. i was ready to not like it.

but instead i discovered that wondrous creativity was launched to make small tweaks to details. there was harriet smith, who may have been plain, but marching here and there with her classmates, dressed in matching red dresses and large hats, providing a very striking image for the eye. there were the chorale music resonating at the end of scenes, leading to or melding into the beginning of the next scene. and bill nighy, who was suitably wary of illness and draughts, but had a spring in his step at times to juxtapose with his fearfully cautious nature.

i thought rupert graves and miranda hart were imaginative choices for the roles of mr. weston and miss bates. and there is even an creative tweak to the one-word title, whereby a period is added after the name to indicate that the movie is - wait for it - a period piece.

so this is the third version of emma in the past 25 years - two movies and a mini-series - and for now at least, it is my favorite.",high

if you've been following me for a while, you know i'm not the biggest fan of rom-coms. it's not that i don't like the genre (i appreciate and enjoy every single one), but i find its movies tremendously difficult to *really* love. the massive majority follow the genre's formulas and cliches to such an extent that i rarely end up truly loving one of these films. some are way too cheesy. others are way too unrealistic and dream-like. but the aspect that throws me off the most is the lack of originality. i can't remember the last rom-com i watched that didn't borrow from countless other installments. i didn't know a thing about palm springs: no trailers, no knowledge of critics/audience's opinion, nothing... and i'm extremely happy about that!

i usually watch the main trailer for every film i review *after* i've seen the actual movie. i ignore all other trailers, clips, images, and so on. i do this so i can have some sort of knowledge regarding how far i can take my spoiler-free reviews. this way, i'm sure that i don't write about something i shouldn't. the official trailer for this film doesn't ruin the experience in any way, but it does tell its viewers the most relevant aspect of its screenplay. so, i could address it in this review, but i won't... because i enjoyed this movie a lot more, not knowing a thing about it than if i knew how it developed its story.

therefore, i'll keep it really vague, and just write that andy siara's first feature-film screenplay can easily snatch a couple of nominations when the awards season comes around. this is a rom-com like no other due to its refreshingly unique concept. it's true that it's not an entirely new method of storytelling. many other movies also employ this idea, but siara holds so many surprises within his narrative and so few of the genre's common traits that the whole film is elevated by his outstanding writing.

it's one of the most entertaining movies of the year. with a short runtime and a fast pace, palm springs is constantly being genuinely fun, engaging, and even mysteriously intriguing. its original plot makes the viewer think and remember previous lines that take a whole different meaning a few minutes later. there are no predictably dumb narrative decisions, and its characters escape the cheesy and forced relationships that these films usually insert them in. the dialogues are hilariously captivating. almost every single plot point packs an emotional punch, a jaw-dropping revelation that never crossed the viewer's mind.

andy samberg and cristin milioti share such great chemistry. their characters are exceptionally developed, and their relationship feels incredibly real. i'm rarely that viewer who requires the main characters to be together, kiss, fall in love, and all that, but nyles and sarah are two wonderful protagonists i can definitely root for. both carry an interesting ""baggage"", which is also explored at a deep level. they deal very differently with the ""situation"" that the story puts them in, and it's so much fun to watch them go through it and evolve as characters. oh, and j.k. simmons (roy)... this man doesn't know how not to be utterly remarkable!

max barbakow (directorial debut) demonstrates his talents as well, by allowing siara's screenplay to shine under impeccable direction. tonally, it never loses its balance. it keeps its comedy pretty grounded, considering the craziness of its premise. it never relies on the genre's formulas, cliches, and cheesy outcomes. it really separates itself from the majority of modern rom-coms. i don't really have any flaws to point out... the ending does have a ""just accept it"" narrative component, and there are a couple of unnecessary scenes, but i'm nitpicking here.

i can't believe i'm going to write this, but palm springs is not only one of the best rom-coms i've ever seen, but it's also one of the best (if not *the* best) movies of 2020, so far. with the help of their first-time director (max barbakow), andy samberg and cristin milioti spread their extraordinary chemistry all over the innovative, original narrative, written by the also debutant, andy siara. the latter is undoubtedly the main responsible for such an entertaining film. siara takes an imaginative concept and develops it in the most captivating, fun, hilarious, and even intriguing way possible. a surprising screenplay packed with emotionally impactful plot points, revelations, and twists that keep the enjoyment levels extremely high. the two protagonists are exceptionally developed, as well as their compelling relationship. with a fast pace and a perfect balance of its tone, palm springs sets itself apart from the other movies of the genre, staying away from all of the cliches, formulas, and stereotypes associated with it. j.k. simmons also lends his awesomeness because why not? whether you're a fan of rom-coms or not, i definitely suggest giving this one a look. you won't be disappointed!

rating: a",high
7185,"palm springs puts a new spin on the old time loop story, and i am surprised at how well it works. andy samberg is fantastic as ever and shows off a little more acting chops than i give him credit for with the more emotional scenes in the film. the chemistry that he and christin milloti share is spectacular and felt so incredibly genuine. i felt so many things during this movie ranging from happiness, sadness, and laughter, it really takes you for a ride and it is such a fantastic one at that. this is such an underrated film and i cannot recommend this enough.

7203,"mortal kombat is not just too long for a movie based on a fighting video game; it’s actually too dumb to even be a movie based on a fighting video game. on the one hand it does a resident evil, introducing a new character and making him the hero, instead of giving this role to an already established character – preferably one that is, you know, popular among the franchise’s fan base.

and on the other hand, it dips into the same old mk well, kicking off with the hanzo hasashi family massacre – kombat’s equivalent of the biblical massacre of the innocents. only last year the animated mortal kombat legends: scorpion's revenge covered the exact same ground, and did it a lot better. the intertitle that follows the prologue confirms that we are not about to see anything new (earthrealm blahblahblah tournament blahblahblah outworld blahblahblah).

mk21 contains exactly (sub)zero surprises. the first time we see jax, we know he is going to lose his original arms and have them replaced with cybernetic prosthetics (the only surprising thing about this is that the character's first replacement arms are quite underwhelming. jax eventually gets something more in line with what we’re used to; the question is, why does the movie do in three steps what it should do in two?). similarly, kano's true, treacherous nature is no secret.

we already know all this. we know it like the backs of our hands. if we don't know it from playing the game, we know it from watching the 1995 movie – speaking of which, mk95 is 10 minutes shorter (it wasted little time with pre-tournament antics, and it didn’t even bother with a training montage; in contrast, mk21 includes what is best described as a tutorial, not the way you want to go about evoking a video game feel), which is to say 10 minutes better. it also had better effects; its goro was clumsy and awkward – something like the cryptkeeper on stereoids – but when johnny cage punched him in the balls, i felt it. conversely, when cole (lewis tan), the aforementioned brand-new character, fights goro in mk21, it’s like he’s shadowboxing, and his shadow happens to be a four-armed man-mountain of pixels.

all things considered, what’s the point of watching a movie where we can anticipate every important event, and anything we don’t see coming a mile away turns out to be unnecessary? for example, it's cool – pun intended – when sub-zero makes it hail, but that’s just a gimmick – nothing more than smoke and mirrors.",low
7204,"ok... my wife is the mortal kombat fan of the family, and the fighting game fan of the family. so this should really be her review... because i'm just going to trash it.

the problem here is plot, as in they actually tried to add in a real plot. mortal kombat is a fighting game. you play it to peacefully beat your friends to a bloody pulp... and that is where the fun is.

but they added a plot.

in twister, the star of the show was the tornado. the plot was there to move the view from tornado to tornado. and in back draft, it was the same... with fire.

mortal kombat thought it had to be deep. it thought it had to be something more than it a tournament. it thought the characters had to have more than surface level depth.

the didn't.

the tournament should have been the star. the plot should have only been there to move you from fight to fight with a climax that shouted ""fatality!"" and left it at that.

instead they tried to add depth where no depth was needed... and that killed the fun of mortal kombat.

not every movie needs to have a plot and characters, some movies work best as mindless popcorn munching escapism.",low

7213,"to me this was great entertainment. a really nice rollercoaster of adventure with healthy dose of humour and fantasy.

dwayne johnson is indeed one of my favourite actors these days and he makes a good performance as the somewhat crazy riverboat captain which is (a lot) more than he seems.

this movie is meant to entertain and nothing else. i am quite happy that, despite it being a new disney production, there’s really not much in terms of woke bullshit preaching in there. a little bit rubbish, especially at the end, but it’s bearable. maybe disney has learned the lesson as to how much that crap actually hits the bottom line.

the movie is really a non-stop (almost) rollercoaster of action a ‘la indiana jones and tomb raider but with a more humorous slant to it. some people complain about god knows what from the music score to the jokes to the camera movement to whatever. it’s a movie that are just supposed to entertain from start to finish without having to be deep, realistic or delivering some sort of message and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. rather the inverse actually. it was great to just disconnect and watch the adventure and action.

as i said, dwayne johnson did his role nicely as the riverboat captain, frank wolff, but most of the rest of the main characters was quite okay. sure, frank’s jokes were cringeworthy but then, they were meant to be. macgregor houghton was at times a bit annoying but at times quite hilarious. i quite liked when frank threw his ridiculously large luggage overboard although it was of course quite predictable.

the weakest character was probably prince joachim who was mostly silly. he wasn’t far out enough to be a really noteworthy crazy psychopath but not “normal” enough to be taken seriously.

if i should complain about anything it would be that the manoeuvres that wreck of frank’s performed was, well, not very realistic although it was not as bad as that “handbrake turn” the idiot script writer wrote into battleship. that one pretty much ruined the movie. then, there’s also no way the amazon river is deep enough for a bloody submarine.

i watched this movie with my kids and girlfriend and we all had a really good time watching it.",high

adapted from one of the original disneyland attractions, _jungle cruise_ is disney’s attempt at another family-friendly adventure movie. it’s hard not to draw comparisons between the franchise adapted from another disneyland attraction, pirates of the caribbean. however, where _pirates of the caribbean: curse of the black pearl_ still stands as one of the finest examples of action movies 18 years after its release, _jungle cruise_ falters at the starting block.",low
7220,"zach snyder is a director i have an incredible amount of respect for. he has a truly original vision, he makes films unlike anyone else, and he seems to relish being a bit of an outsider who somehow gets to make whatever he wants. sort of like this generation's version of 90's/00's robert rodriguez.

yet, try as i might i just can't seem to actually enjoy his films. i won't bother going into it because personally i'd prefer not enjoying a wacky zach snyder film then being mildly entertained by most mainstream fluff that seem crafted by algorithms. 

if you like snyder's films this one will most likely be a real joy. if you don't this one won't win you over. either way, i hope he gets to keep making his manic fever dreams because we need more films with authentic voices.",low
7221,"the only good thing about zack snyder's masturbatory exercise army of the dead, is that it's comparatively shorter than his version of justice league – but what movie isn't? an hour and a half short of a four-hour movie is still too long, especially considering that if everything we've seen before were edited out of the film, aotd would be a short feature.

true, we may not have seen a heist/zombie apocalypse movie, but we've seen dozens of heists and dozens of zombie apocalypses, and bringing the two genres together only serves to highlight the inconsistencies of each. but, let us start at the beginning. a us military convoy is transporting an unknown cargo from area 51. the two soldiers in the cab of the truck debate the contents of the box (“the original draft of the constitution written in the blood of the founding fathers… amelia earhart, long live "", etc.). whatever it is, it’s highly inflammable, judging by how the truck instantly turns into a huge ball of fire the moment it makes contact with a considerably smaller vehicle.

actually it is some kind of superhuman zombie that kills a bunch of soldiers and infects two of them. this entire scenario could easily have unfolded without the arbitrary and random explosion; the gigantic fireball is here solely because snyder is such an impatient director that, in a 140-minute film, he can't wait even five minutes before blowing something to bits – the cinematic equivalent of premature ejaculation.

on the other hand, snyder takes his time on plot points that we all know by heart. hero is offered a job. hero turns down job. hero changes his mind and takes the job. hero assembles team. and so on and so forth. so as to leave no cliché unused, the hero also has an estranged daughter, kate (ella purnell); this, however, deserves some more attention.

kate works in a quarantine camp for zombies, which is nothing short of a logic-defying concept. it is first established that the zombie bite takes immediate effect, transforming the victim into another zombie – and one does not quarantine a zombie; one shoots a zombie in the head and moves on.

now, it has always been a habit of zombie movies to play fast and loose, depending on the requirements of the script, with the time it takes for a bite to kick in, but two wrongs don’t make a right. all things considered, aotd is a rip-off that makes it a point of ripping off bad ideas – which might be all right if it were a parody, but the movie is too bloated and excessive to ever be able to take itself lightly.",low

characters, relationships, and plot points are far from compelling, making the whole movie feel extremely forced and somewhat predictable. with no surprise factor and zero innovative developments, the overextended runtime simply becomes heavier and heavier...

an utter waste of remarkable actors.

when it comes to horror, i'm always willing to give any film a shot, even when everything indicates it's probably going to be a massive failure. i'm admittedly not a saw fanatic, despite quite enjoying the first two movies. after these, i can't even remember which installments i actually watched or not. not even the most recent jigsaw caught my attention. in preparation for spiral, i tried to determine precisely how it would be placed in the saga's timeline, which proved to be a surprisingly challenging task. basically, what matters for this film is that john walker (tobin bell) and his work as the jigsaw serial killer are acknowledged, making this a sequel. with that said…

unfortunately, spiral doesn't change my opinion about the franchise. it's a formula-driven saga that no one really cares about too much anymore. in fact, i'm pretty shocked by the fact that this installment was even greenlit, having in mind the particularly sensitive times our society lives in. countless movies and tv shows are held to stricter standards nowadays with the risk of getting canceled or boycotted if a certain subject is treated poorly. with so much gratuitous violence, it's surprising to see this franchise still alive. boasting curious casting choices - chris rock leading a horror flick is definitely an attention-grabber - the extremely bloody, gory trap killings are packed with life-or-death dilemmas as always, which will surely please hardcore fans.

however, these are just not as captivating or ""fun"" as before. this movie doesn't possess a single, memorable trap that surpasses any of the dozens (hundreds?) from before. just like josh stolberg and peter goldfinger's screenplay, it's just another lazy, unsurprising variation of a well-known formula. to be fair, and i'm trusting other critics who watched all of the other installments, this is supposedly the version that separates the most from the structure people first witnessed in 2004 and 2005. still, being different doesn't mean better, and the competition isn't exactly defined by masterpieces. from my perspective, spiral is just another generic take on an overdone story.

from the repetitively identical kidnapping sequences to the consequent traps, the potential of a great film depended on how darren lynn bousman (saw ii, iii, iv) and the duo of writers tackled the characters, mainly the protagonist. the lack of characterization is definitely a problem, but the baffling laziness in storytelling ruins the entire flow of the movie. with an overwhelming amount of flashbacks and an incredibly choppy, annoying editing work (dev singh), the non-stop heightened, super tense atmosphere transforms every single scene like it's the most crucial moment of the film. consequently, a vast majority of the dialogues are characters screaming and cursing at each other in almost every interaction.

the out-of-control tone negatively affects the cast's performances. many people will look at chris rock (dolemite is my name, madagascar) and believe he's delivering an over-the-top display, but he's just following the chaotic environment established by the director. during the first minutes of the movie, rock is amusing and funny as expected, but he's also able to tap his more dramatic side. however, when every single line of dialogue needs to be interpreted as if it's the most vital part of the film, very few actors can pull it off. samuel l. jackson (glass, spider-man: far from home) is one of them, but his expectedly short screentime doesn't allow for much entertainment. though it's always special seeing slj cursing at someone.

finally, saw is also about finding out who is responsible for the disgusting game, and spiral doesn't remove that essential block of narrative. the issue here is the lack of a jaw-dropping revelation. obviously, this is as subjective as everything you just read until now, but i would be astonished if most viewers didn't guess who the new jigsaw copycat is during the first act. i do want to end on a positive note, so i'll compliment the bold ending. it partially holds the studio against the wall in the sense that the probability of this movie getting a sequel being higher, which can make some viewers think it's too forced. i rather believe they just wanted to have an intense finale, which i can't really deny.

spiral might offer enough blood, gore, and brutal traps/murders to fans of the franchise, but overall it's still just another lazy, predictable take on the saw formula. despite the violently captivating life-or-death sequences, none stands out as an unforgettable moment. josh stolberg and peter goldfinger's screenplay lacks efficient character development, impactful revelations, and, honestly, a massive amount of creativity. from the repetitively tiresome flashbacks and kidnapping scenes to the extremely out-of-control tone, darren lynn bousman isn't able to take the story to its potential. everything is dialed up to its maximum as if every single line of dialogue needs to be screamed from the top of a mountain, which transforms the entire atmosphere into a chaotic environment. chris rock can't be the only one to blame for his over-tense line deliveries, especially when he starts so well. a strong yet abrupt ending doesn't compensate for such dull storytelling. i wish i could write that i'm disappointed, but i didn't have high expectations for this one.

rating: d+",low
7236,"the latest entry into the saw series has a couple okay moments but otherwise this was pretty bad. the acting was probably the worst culprit, chiefly chris rock who sprinkles in his comedic rants while samuel l. jackson phones it in, not that he's given a whole lot to work with (including a hilariously bad fake mustache for a flashback scene). it's also really predictable as i called who the killer was early on.

i'm okay with taking the series in a different direction as there was nowhere else to go with jigsaw (and they stretched his story out a few movies too many) but this was a misfire. **2.0/5**",low

i know sundance is one of those festivals that carry dozens of impressive, impactful films from writer-directors that really throw themselves into the art of filmmaking and storytelling. i anticipated being blown away by many movies that i knew nothing about or didn't recognize the crew and cast involved. i expected some films to emotionally impact me so much that i'd save them close to my heart until the very end of the year. with this said, i was unbelievably far from imagining that the very first viewing would be a heavy contender for my absolute favorite movie of the entire festival.

coda (child of deaf adults) is the first film i watch by siân heder, and after this session, i can't wait to see what she did so far and what she's going to do in the future. the clearly interesting premise is developed through a much more emotional narrative than i expected. from rich visual storytelling to exceptional use of sign language, heder is able to capture something unique and deeply important to transmit to the audience and to today's society. the world was fortunate enough to get sound of metal last year, and coda reinforces the essential message that being deaf must not be seen as a massive disability or a brutal handicap.

as the movie cleverly communicates through its impeccable screenplay, having some sort of ""limitation"" doesn't automatically characterize someone as weird, different, or that the respective family members don't love each other as much or more than the so-called ""normal"" families. except for a somewhat insignificant love relationship featuring the main character (that could have brought up an entirely different, unnecessary, and even distracting topic to the film's central, vital themes), i was incredibly invested in every single storyline.

in fact, i find every interaction within the deaf family much more compelling and captivating than any other dialogue in the movie, and this is mostly due to the amazing performances from the cast. leaving the protagonist to the end, daniel durant (leo rossi, brother) and marlee matlin (jackie rossi, mother) are great as supporting characters, but troy kotsur (frank rossi, father) and eugenio derbez (bernardo villalobos, music teacher) literally left me in tears with their heartfelt displays. i could feel the outstanding commitment to their roles, and i'm delighted that bernardo villalobos isn't just another stereotypical, cliche, hysterical choir adult.

however, the biggest praise in my bag must go to powerful glue that holds everything together, elevating the whole film to a whole other level: emilia jones as the only hearing member of the family, ruby rossi. first of all, i love music, and pentatonix is actually my favorite group (acapella or not), so hearing so many wonderful voices singing together would always be a massive plus for coda in my review. nevertheless, not only jones' voice is sumptuously heartwarming, but her performance has everything an actor needs to receive acting nominations. i can't remember the last time i was fully invested in a single character in such an emotionally powerful manner, and jones is definitely a major reason.

a final praise to paula huidobro's visually grabbing camera work and marius de vries, who composed the movie's subtle yet efficient score and who i'm guessing had a hand in the song choices. either way, terrific job.

coda may very well end up as my favorite film of the 2021's edition of the sundance film festival, and it will undoubtedly become a must-watch movie when it's available worldwide. siân heder offers her impeccable direction and beautifully written screenplay, which is packed with emotionally powerful moments that left me tearing up for the last forty-five minutes. boasting an educative, meaningful message regarding the deaf community and what our society perceives as a tremendous handicap/disability, the characteristic visual storytelling and the captivating interactions within the deaf family prove to be incredibly investing, deeply elevating the overall piece. with the help of heartfelt, genuine performances from the supporting cast (mainly troy kotsur and eugenio derbez), emilia jones takes off and lands one of my favorite female performances in a long, long time. a tear-inducing, thoughtful film that i hope will conquer audiences all around the world.

7240,"i cannot think of one person to whom i wouldn’t recommend “coda,” an uplifting, emotionally rich movie from writer / director sian heder. this crowd-pleasing film is one of the first real gems to debut at this year’s sundance film festival, and i’m still riding the wave of good vibes hours later.

being a teenager is difficult enough, but try being ruby (emilia jones). the 17-year-old is the only hearing member of a deaf family, and she spends most of her spare time working on her parents’ (marlee matlin, troy kotsur) fishing boat along with her older brother, leo (daniel durant). and serving as their sign language interpreter. ruby juggles her family responsibilities, her schoolwork, and a newfound passion for her high school’s choir club (and her cute duet partner, miles (ferdia walsh-peelo)). when her music teacher (eugenio derbez) hears that special something in ruby’s voice, he encourages her to think about a life beyond fishing and supports her in applying to a prestigious music school. this unfairly puts the responsibility of the household on ruby’s shoulders, and she must choose between keeping her family afloat or pursuing her dreams.

this very funny and very honest story has a universal appeal, with charming performances and a likeable family that you’ll want to spend time with. kotsur and matlin are terrific as ruby’s randy parents, and derbez brings a genuine charisma to his role as the young woman’s mentor. the cast includes three deaf actors, so much of the dialogue is expressed in sign language — and everything about that feels normal. this film goes a long way in shattering stereotypes about people who are hearing impaired, and that is to be commended.

heder has created a film that’s filled with insight, refreshingly direct dialogue, and a fully developed cast of characters that all add up to solid storytelling all around. not only is this a coming-of-age story for ruby, but it’s one for her family, too. the four of them struggle through the disappointment that life throws their way, hoping to work together to emerge stronger than ever.

there was also a scene early on when michael fights a bunch of firefighters just came off as silly looking, maybe because i'm so used to seeing him butcher people one by one, the shot, beyond being clumsily choreographed, showed him taking on 5-6 people; just looked strange.

""the matrix resurrections is one of my biggest disappointments of the year. lana wachowski delivers a surprisingly meta, self-aware movie about the original trilogy packed with bold, fascinating ideas but an absolutely terrible execution.

from the dreadfully unfunny, cringe-worthy brainstorming sessions about the previous films to the heavy-handed, headache-inducing exposition, the director constantly tries to tell the viewers how incredible the original trilogy is, forgetting to create a compelling, captivating story for this new installment.

the gorgeous visuals and impactful score aren't good enough to elevate the shockingly average, choppy action sequences. despite remarkable performances from keanu reeves, carrie-anne moss, and the standout jessica henwick, resurrections just didn't work for me.

7267,"long awaited and very conspiricized, **'spider-man:no way home'** lives up and surpasses hype, the introduction of charcters once thought cordened off into the mcu, came both as a shock and as an eventual certainty. the pleathora of indephth easter eggs creates awonderful viewing for the spider-man fan but alienates the casual none mcu fanatic viewers. the plot is dense not in fault but in advantage, it crams in expectation with suitable comedy and light heartedness. the director created a a comprehensive journey of emotion with several troughs and many peaks leaving a sense of woah at the end.

overall, **'spider-man nwh'** is a marvel maniac's heaven but can ruin marvel experiences for the uniformed viewers spoiling previous films and enjoyment of them. this is not a stand-alone film and for some this amazing but for many of those seeking to enter the universe this is not at all suitable. this and the poorly grand soundtrack make it 4.5 stars.",high

best spider man movie i have ever seen. literally got chills watching it cinema hall. cinema hall turned into stadium. the screams, the excitement, the hype - all about it is amazing in it's own way. a total fan service.",high
7269,"wow! loved it!

i'd recommend not reading any reviews if you plan to watch it - i didn't and i'm sure glad i didn't! spoilers inbound!

where to begin? i was not expecting to love this film as much as i do! it surpassed my expectations in every way possible, to the point that i'd say it beats <em>'avengers: endgame'</em> as my favourite production from the mcu. this is a next level superhero movie, it's easily the most i've consistently enjoyed a film in this series and genre - no question.

the cast are all outstanding, it's ace how they work everyone in from previous iterations of <em>'spider-man'</em> - even away from the main universe. seeing tom holland, andrew garfield and tobey maguire together onscreen as peter parker is tremendous. the film does it in the perfect way, at no point does it feel forced or needless and the humour between the trio is excellent; in fact, the whole film is funny when it intends to be.

zendaya, benedict cumberbatch, jacob batalon (his best showing of the trilogy), jon favreau and marisa tomei also add positives things to this 2021 film. jamie foxx, alfred molina and, most pleasing for me, willem dafoe all reprise their characters from past releases and are all a joy. i'm a fan of dafoe so was particularly happy to see him reappear.

onto what we see onscreen. the plot is great and i wouldn't change anything about it, there is one or two things that i had question marks about whilst watching but those quickly dissipated. the pacing is top notch and the music is superb, the respective screen times of everybody was pinpoint and, along with the already noted humour, the film also packs a punch on a more serious level to boot.

this really is top tier marvel! would watch again, would recommended etc. awesome!",high
7270,"this is the perfect marvel movie that isn't an avengers film. it pays off everything thing it builds up, corrects previous misgivings and really gets the character of spider-man right. all while setting things up in an interesting way that it's bound to be fresh next time out. absolutely loved this.",high
7273,"this movie brings it from start to finish, there is not a dull moment in this film, and we truly see the birth of a new spider-man. as a superhero and mcu fan, this is a much watch and breaks open the multi-verse entirely. a welcomed addition to the fresh new phase four of the mcu.

7275,"**one of marvel's absolute best!**

watching no way home felt like my childhood and my adulthood were embracing each other in a warm, friendly hug. the nostalgia was brilliantly balanced with advancing tom holland's spider-man and developing his character. andrew garfield's spider-man also received some long-awaited closure after an abrupt end to his story. the effects, action, and humor all reinforced a heartfelt film focusing on the characters' processing of loss and grief.",high
7276,"spider-man: no way home is like the proverbial blind squirrel that finds a nut every now and then, except that it doesn’t so much find them as it steals them from another squirrel’s hoard. the massive combined gravitas generated by willem dafoe, alfred molina, and jamie foxx would be enough to save any other movie; the problem is that this film is not theirs to save, and it’s barely a film at all to begin with – it’s more like the superhero equivalent of that pink panther movie they made with spare parts from previous pink panther movies.

if i want willem dafoe as the green goblin, why not just revisit 2002’s spider-man? similarly, if i have a hankering for alfred molina as doc ock, why not just rewatch 2004’s spider-man 2? the latter was, according to roger ebert, “the best superhero movie since the modern genre was launched with ""superman""”. how the mighty have fallen. it’s great to see dafoe and molina sharing screen time, but once the novelty – or rather the nostalgia – wears off, we are left with only a reminder of how comparatively superior sam raimi’s trilogy was, as well as a testament of how downhill things have gone since then.

when molina finally arrives, following an excruciatingly dumb, seemingly endless first half hour, he does so like a godsend; unfortunately, as much as we welcome the company of someone with a gleam of intelligence in his eyes, doc ock’s edge has been dulled by poor stylistic choices – first, his mechanical tentacles are 100% computer-generated (as opposed to spider-man 2, which used cgi to enhance, but not fully replace, a set of prop tentacles), and second, molina was digitally de-aged (as was dafoe), though in this case, unlike for example the irishman, the unintended uncanny valley effect might have been a blessing in disguise; after all, doc ock is supposed to be a comic book villain, so that grotesqueness actually becomes him.

all things considered, everything and everyone endemic to the mcu spider-man is as flat and artificial as cardboard (our sympathy inevitably lies with the villains because, goblins and octopuses though they may be, they remain at all times more human – and certainly have a cleverer sense of humor – than any of the heroes with the exception of tobey maguire, and while spider-man may prevail over norman osborne, dafoe totally obliterates holland in terms of acting); at the same time, all the best parts are almost exclusively lifted from the work – and not even the best work at that – of a much more talented filmmaker. to put it bluntly, spider-man: no way home has absolutely no reason for being.",low
7277,spiderman no way home is one of the best films ever made. playing in perfectly on nostalgia but in the good way. realising childhood dreams and exceeding expectations while also delivering a good standalone film for the people who never watched spiderman. the hype is real. go watch this very awesome movie!,high

""old is one of those cases of a remarkably unique, intriguing concept failing to reach its potential due to an overall disappointing execution of too many ideas. m. night shyamalan delivers yet another divisive film, tackling deeper themes associated with our relationship with time and how the latter impacts people in distinct ways. the trademark final act revelation not only negatively affects the main theme of the movie but also raises dozens of plot and character inconsistencies, too many to handle. the acting is surprisingly as poor as some of the awful dialogues, despite great casting concerning the kid-to-adult transitions. the main family's arc is one worth investing in, but there are too many disposable, irrelevant characters. the technically accurate, detailed cinematography might not be pleasant for every viewer, but the editing definitely lacks some finesse. unfortunately, i can't defend shyamalan too much on this one...""

rating: c-",low
7282,"old is a very unique and interesting idea as a film. that is about the only positive thing i can say about it. the entire movie feels jumbled together, the pacing moves incredibly fast and choppy at some points, jumping from one small event to another. as a viewer you never get to sit in atmosphere of what has just occurred because it rips you away into another event. the writing in this film is simply not good. there is a ton of cheesy dialogue and character reactions that just do not make sense. i originally thought that the acting was just bad, but i think it has more to do with the material they are trying to work with. the cheesy lines can be fine if that was the style of film they were trying to make, but with the very serious and melodramatic tone it just comes off as awkward. there is a very weird and kind of off-putting direction that the story goes relating to the children that just made me uncomfortable as well. it is sad that this film had so much potential, and trailers really sell that potential, but what we were delivered was far from a quality film.

7294,"i am quite a fan of jason statham so i am perhaps a bit biased when it comes to movies he is in but, to me, this was a great action thriller. i very much like statham playing the silent, mysterious tough guy role. he is perfect in this role.

the movie builds up somewhat slowly but it does not take very long before statham shows that he is not an ordinary security guy when he takes down some wannabe robbers with nothing less than extreme efficiency. a very cool scene.

on one side i like that the movie takes some time to build up the suspense and reveal the plot. in articular why statham is there in the first place. on the other side the way the movie does it irks me somewhat. there just to much flashbacks for my taste and some events we are forced to watch from no less than three different perspectives. felt a bit like a filler to me. still, statham’s passed and presents weaves together in a story that, to me, is quite good and not the everyday, run of the mill, revenge story. quite well done actually.

not entirely surprising the movie builds up to a big showdown in the end. i very much liked it. lots of action although i would have liked that they let a few more of the good guys actually survive. the death count on both sides was somewhat excessive.

the ending was satisfactory although from a point in the showdown, about twenty or minutes from the end, it was rather predictable.

the reason this movie gets four and a half (or 9 out of 10) stars instead of the full five out of five is only because of the flash backs which. some of them contributed to the movie but some of them actually bored me a bit.",high

7311,the worst movie i've ever seen. don't waste your time.,low
7315,"i'll open by saying i am not a fan of villeneuve. in fact, i think he's a hack whose only genuine talent is making stupid people falsely think they are actually quite smart. i am also a huge dune fan. they have been my favourite series of books since i first discovered them as a teenager. so although i hoped for the best with this, i was expecting the worst. what i got was somewhere in the middle. it's an ok movie, not great, thankfully not terrible, but ok

it got some things right the 1984 lynch version got wrong, but still somehow managed to get other stuff wrong (including stuff lynch got right). it was also a surprise how much villeneuve just lifted directly from the lynch film, both visually and auditorily.

the wardrobe choices were a huge disappointment. if you didn't know the time setting, going just on the clothes in the new dune you'd be forgiven for thinking it was set a mere forty or fifty years (if that) in the future rather than the twenty thousand years in the future when it's really set. the lynch stillsuits look futuristic, unworldly, and something that really would keep you alive in the deep desert. the new desert wear looks like they are just going to go dirt biking for an hour or two in our present-day world.

the casting (completely ignoring the pointless gender swap) was good, however, with the exception of paul, chani, and rabban the original casting was all better. but the original (apart from the odd decision to use the totally unsuited kyle maclachlan) was a masterclass in how to cast the perfect people for the role.

anyway, enough of the comparisons, this film is about the first two-thirds of the first novel. i always thought the story would be better told via a big-budget tv series (or even mini-series) rather than a standalone movie. i still think what they tried to cover here was too much for a single movie, but it was a step in the right direction.

the film mainly sticks to the book story but does make some needless changes, the most obvious of which being the changes made to both the gender and story of liet kynes, which in turn impacts the story of chani. most other changes are small and mainly insignificant though.

the film being filmed in norway, jordan, and abu dhabi looks fantastic and very well suited to the large screen. and it's clear a great deal of time, effort, and money was put into the sets that looked equally good as the places they were meant to be.

the acting was of a suitably high standard, but unfortunately, many of the dune names and terms were horribly mispronounced. that and the hans zimmer fart that is played constantly throughout the soundtrack is likely to pull people out of their emersion in the movie.

i was also somewhat surprised by what was left out, ok the source material is very dense and obviously some needed to be cut, but i don't really think it's made clear just how crucial melange is to the functioning of the empire and society as a whole. also what (and why) mentats are is largely ignored, you may think that isn't overly important, but it is at the core of how many things are done in the dune universe.

over all, it's not a bad movie. despite its flaws, i still think the 1984 lynch version is better though.",low
7317,"i read frank herbert's book, dune, when i was in high school and really don't remember it much except that it was great and a little scary. at that age, i probably didn't get the subtext message.

i never saw any movies of it so i decided to watch both the 1984 dune by david lynch and the 2021 denis villeneuve version sequentially. i'm going to talk about both of them here.

this may not be a popular opinion: lynch's version is **brilliant** and the villeneuve dune is absolute **shit**. here's why:

first, is the villeneuve dune slick? yes, absolutely. i should hope so considering it's nearly 40 years after lynch did his, for crissake.

are the character's in david lynch's version kitschy and over the top? yes! that's one reason it's so much better! it's sci fi, duh! you watch marvel movies and suspend disbelief for incredible, imaginary super powers? all of lynch's characters are downright gritty and believable within this particular surreal fantasy.

by the end of the lynch dune, i had sympathy for nearly every character in the film. even the villains caught my emotions. paul atreides character development was realistic and attractive.

villeneuve's characters? i felt like my neighbor came over and asked, ""hey, can you come to watch my kid's junior high school play?"" ""sure, denis, just let me fill my 1-liter flask with tequila first.""

villeneuve's characters were so damned flat and lifeless that they evoked no emotional response whatsoever. although i occasionally sit through a bad flick, i can't remember recently watching a movie as awful character-wise, as the 2021 dune. if i were an actor on that set, i would be silently screaming. how does a director even do this?

oh, and where's the creativity? it's 46 years since george lucas founded industrial light & magic, and denis can't create one single, new, goddamn space machine 46 years later? (one could argue the hummingbird copter is new, but it's not so creative when you realize that we didn't even know how hummingbird wings actually worked until this millennia.)

but here's the real clincher: the screenplay. david lynch gave us a complete story. sadly, he didn't have the final cut and disowned his film when the critics panned it. despite the fact that lynch is a true artist and genius, the studio took 45 minutes out of the film. 45 minutes! even ruined by the studio, even 40 years later, lynch's film has a clear vision and carries the timeless message that frank herbert intended. i would love to see the original cut!

villeneuve, on the other hand, stopped abruptly in the middle of the book. i now realize that denis is not about the story. denis is all about the franchise money, and that sucks. as a result of the bad screenplay, this 2021 version doesn't even carry the socio-political statement it was supposed to have. i want my 155 minutes back.

i don't watch part 2s, especially when it comes to void-of-creativity and void-of-character-development hollywood movies. you can take your bad franchise and shove it up your sci fi black hole.

admittedly, i loved blade runner 2049, but this is so disappointing, i may never watch another villeneuve film again. do yourself a favor and see david lynch's version of dune.",low
7319,"i was really eager to watch this movie and at the same time a wee bit concerned because i knew that i would be hugely disappointed if it turned out to be another movie massacring a classic source material.

i have to admit that it was a very long time since i read the dune books but i have to say that the movie was mostly true to the books, as i remember them, and also reasonably free of agenda driven rubbish apart from the odd replacement of some characters with “gender correct” ones for no real good reason.

there is really not much point in me saying much about the story. it should be well known for any science fiction fan and it is a great story and really good material for a big screen movie despite some “critics” at rotten tomatoes moaning about it and calling it unwieldly etc. probably too big a book with too many words for the small, agenda driven, brains of rotten tomatoes “critics”. no surprise there.

the movie as a whole is wonderful to watch, the scenery is oftentimes very beautiful and the décor, the buildings, the machinery is very well done. i was surprised that the world of caladan was portrayed as a rather austere scottish looking landscape but after getting over the initial surprise it worked very well actually.

i also like that the harkonnen, especially the baron, are not turned into some exaggerated comical figures but, although disgusting and despicable, they are actual humans.

overall the casting was quite good and everyone played their roles well. at the beginning i felt that paul was a bit too wimpy, from what i remember of the book he was quite well trained and skilled already from the start, but he picked up as the movie went along.

it is a science fiction, borderline fantasy, movie so there should be some special effects, right? this is a difficult movie to make special effects for since this universe is a weird mix between futuristic science fiction, fantasy elements and old-fashioned traditions.

i have to say that they succeeded quite well though. the atmosphere felt just right, ships, spice harvesters, buildings looked cool and fitting the story. the way they implemented the personal shields was very nice. they didn’t go overboard on special effects and weird designs. the ornithopter was of course totally ridiculous from a scientific point of view but at least it looked pretty cool.

if i should complain about something, although that is not the fault of the movie but of the source material, i have never understood how, in a universe which is obviously driven by hidden agendas, machinations and assassinations, the atreides could just pick up everything, leave their home and put all their important eggs in one basket at arrakis.

one more small thing that i could complain about would of course be that we now have to wait two years, from what i have read, until we get to watch the next movie to get to the part were the really cool stuff happens.

bottom line, this was movie is definitely in there vying for the title “best movie that i have watched this year”.",high
7321,"_dune_ was a massive undertaking due to the sheer amount of lore and political backstory director villeneuve had to fit in a two-and-a-half-hour run-time, but i am happy to say it was executed brilliantly.

the story of _dune_ is incredibly deep, there are so many layers of political factions and relationships that it can get quite confusing at times. i had to constantly be looking up specific individuals and their ties to each other to understand the minor nuances of the story. despite that fact, villeneuve is still able to deliver a coherent narrative that will allow the majority of the audience to understand the overarching plot. after the buildup of the first act, the story gets cooking, and i was utterly invested.

there is an incredible atmosphere present in this film. it begins as a sci-fi epic, following a house starting anew on a fresh planet and a new industry to conquer. you can feel the optimism and the sense of discovery in the shots due to the interesting angles, lighting, and a brilliant soundtrack composed by hans zimmer. but as the narrative evolves so does the tone, as a thick fog of helplessness bleeds on to the screen and you can feel the dread form. this tone was quite refreshing in today’s blockbuster cinema, as each movie needs to incorporate a vast amount of unnecessary comedy to appeal to the broader audience. dune is unapologetic about what the story is trying to deliver and gives you exactly what it wants without any concessions.

the visuals are stunning throughout the entire runtime. one of my favorite scenes was during the spice extraction visit. i loved the blend of realism that was used in this science fiction setting. the ships and equipment look like they could exist in our own world with a few technological advancements. the fight choreography is really well done, especially the hand-to-hand combat. the final scene was epic, each fist and punch were so sharp and calculated, it was really impressive to watch in the age of jump cut action.

the acting is perfect throughout the film, i really cannot point to any one character that felt off or out of place. timothee chalamet did an incredible job as the lead man. he delivered a heartfelt performance and evolved throughout the entire film into the confident leader the story crashendos on. rebecca ferguson, oscar isaac, and josh brolin all did great jobs as well. i really brought the somewhat complex nature of lady jessic and duke leto, they had really great chemistry with themselves and with their son. stellan skarsgard had my favorite performance of the entire film. i felt entirely disgusted everytime he was on the screen, and he made the hairs on the back of my neck stand tall. he is truly a man poisoned by greed and will not stop at anything on his path to fortune. jason momoa does a fantastic job here too. i felt he really fit his role and his lines were delivered effortlessly, much better than his performance in the dceu.

_dune_ delivers a fantastic sci-fi epic that gave me everything i was looking for and i will be eagerly awaiting the sequel's release.

**verdict:** _excellent_",high
7323,"generally i love crime-thrillers (both fiction and non-fiction) and this had some good elements, but the editing was shoddy, performances uneven with bruce willis once again phoning it in. he has maybe 10-minutes of a screentime and is a non-factor with the plot outside of being megan fox's partner who disappears only to briefly show up at the end.

7345,"""**space sweepers**"" is south korea's first-ever space science fiction show. for their first venture into space, they did not disappoint and made sure audiences were awed by the show's deep story and unforgettable space adventure.

> **space sweepers** ***is lightyears better from recent western space scifi shows.***

## story
the story started out as a typical western space scifi. humanity encountered a life threatening situation and the only way out was up, out there in outer space. slowly and perfectly the korean signature in storytelling and plots surfaced up and it started to get very interesting.

there was a grand or overarching story guiding space sweepers but they instead zoomed-in and told the story from a human perspective. this approach allowed them to tackle the questions from the vantage point of ordinary humans, attaching the audiences to the characters in ways not possible from a ""bigger picture"" method. a story about a crew of ""space sweepers"" but at the same time it was not about them.

it is rare to see this type of story and storytelling in live-action movies considering the limited time available and yet they were able to flesh out the characters, presented a family relationship plots, questioned human moralities and ethics, and explored the notion about ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"".

## acting/cast
the casting was excellent. song joong ki, playing as ""tae ho"", and kim tae ri, playing as ""captain jang"", are two popular and veteran korean actors. they were joined in by jin seon kyu as ""tiger park"", yoo hae jin as the robot, and the child actress park ye rin as ""dorothy"". five actors who complimented each others' acting style enabled them to bring the story closer to the audience.

kim tae ri is best known from her 2016 movie ""the handmaiden"" and the netflix tv series ""mr. sunshine"" in 2018. despite the huge jump from historical romance genre to a space scifi action and adventure, kim tae ri has proven once again her talent in acting. she showed her character's strength and fierceness and yet behind it all she was caring and loving.

song joong ki is well known from his major role in the hugely popular 2016 tv series ""descendants of the sun"". he masterfully played his character, a man who lost his daughter in a tragedy and ended up as a sweeper of space debris to make his living. throughout the movie, he showed perfectly the thoughts and goals of his character despite of what was in front of him. his emotions and expressions were in check, thus completing the aura of his character while at the same time letting the audience feel his sadness and difficult choices.

special mention is the child actress park ye rin. she is technically a newbie in the industry, having only appeared as a guest in a 2020 tv series. having thrown in a blockbuster film this early would have a huge challenge for her and yet she amazingly showed that she was born an actress. she played as ""dorothy"", one of the key characters in this film. this being a space scifi, which means they had a lot of filming in front of green screens, park ye rin was not distracted and was able to deliver her dialogues and interacted with her co-stars naturally. oh, did i not say that she's only 7 years old?

## production
they did not shy away from giving this a budget. the superb visual effects, cgi, and editing, definitely placed this movie equal in rank with western shows like ""star trek"" and ""marvel's guardians of the galaxy"" to name two.

it was also a brilliant idea to bring in actors from different nationalities and to use their native languages. this is rarely done and is simply explained as some magic or technology like a ""universal translator"". but that's not where it ends … even though they have a ""universal translator"", they did not resorted to ""english"" or ""korean"" as a ""universal language"". they showed all directors in the world how to properly portray different languages even if there is a ""universal translator"" available.

that deserves a huge mention especially for a show which concerns multiple nationalities, languages, and cultures--the planet earth. the flow of the story was not broken even though the characters were speaking different languages. everything was flowing smoothly, this is how it actually will be like if ""universal translators"" become a reality. well done!

## conclusion
while this is a space science fiction film, the story was about you and me, being a human, and the relationships we build in each of our adventures. this is what ""space sweepers"" was about. it is about you and me. our humanity. our frailties. the challenges we face every single day and how to ultimately triumph (or not).

can you guess how many languages were spoken and nationalities represented in ""space sweepers""?

despite what the name implies, petite maman feels just as grand. the story focuses on nelly (joséphine sanz), an eight-year-old who has just lost her grandmother (margot abascal). nelly is our entry point to the story, so we don’t always know what’s going on around her. her grandmother seems to have passed due to a condition she’s had for most of her life, but it’s not something nelly has a name for. along with her mother (nina meurisse) and father (stéphane varupenne), nelly goes to her grandmother’s home to pack up what remains of her belongings. they all spend one night in the house, but then nelly’s mother leaves suddenly while nelly and her father remain to finish the job. why nelly’s mother leaves is never fully explained, but nelly can tell that her mother has been sad for a long time and that her leaving has something to do with that.",high
7355,"one of the best things i can say about the “tom and jerry” feature movie, now streaming on hbo max, is that it isn’t wholly terrible. the animation is bright, the human cast delivers enjoyably goofy performances, and the film stays true to the original cartoon’s roots. it isn’t super funny nor creative, but the fun story about a celebrity wedding gone awry and a stuffy new york city hotel that employs a cat to rid them of a mouse problem lays the groundwork for a bit of amusing mayhem.

blending classic animation with live action, the effects are better than expected. the actors (including chloë grace moretz, michael peña, pallavi sharda, and colin jost) do a great job interacting with their cat and mouse counterparts, and the cartoonish elements are reminiscent of the classic tom and jerry of the past. the story rekindles the rivalry between the two, but is updated for modern audiences.

the physical comedy and sight gags are good for most of the giggles, but that’s where the humor stops. there’s also a lot of unnecessary potty humor and a few questionable plot points (the movie does little to rise above certain stereotypes) that may feel cringe-worthy to some adults.

“tom and jerry” isn’t noteworthy at all, but it’s not awful, either. there’s enough here to entertain most kids for a couple of hours.",low
7356,"the spirit of the old cartoons is nowhere to be seen here, and that's the biggest disappointment. there is certainly enough here to entertain families - albeit probably not the parents - and i can envision this film playing on repeat for certain kids. alas, for anyone looking to recapture the magic of the cartoons and revisiting some old favourites, it's best to look elsewhere.

7357,"oh, for heaven's sake!! why? what for? who on earth ever thought this was a good idea? those of us who regularly watched the chaotic antics of ""jerry"", his arch-nemesis ""tom"" and his own persecutor ""spike"" know well that these are at their best when delivered as quickly paced, entertaining, five minute bursts of slapstick comedy. this, on the other hand, is a turgid and lacklustre vehicle for chloë grace moretz (""kayla"") to demonstrate that she has a lovely smile but very little else as this nonsense sees her impersonating someone to get a job at an hotel. here, a celebrity wedding with an indian theme is set to take place and she is charged with making the wedding of ""ben"" (colin jost) and ""preeta"" (pallavi sharda) (or ought that to be chopra-jonas?) - complete with animated elephants - go smoothly. ""tom"" and ""jerry"" have to stop their constant bickering to put on a united front to help her out after predictable carnage ensues. when this is left to the two cartoon characters, it can be passable - otherwise it is a travesty of animated history that ought to be consigned to the deepest vault in the deepest trench of the pacific ocean. shocking!",low
7358,"well, i don't want to say it's horrible... but that's about all.

for a tom and jerry cartoon, there is very little actual tom and jerry and more of the focus is on the live action actors than the animated characters. and that, honestly, is my biggest complaint.

all the rest of it is exactly what one would expect. especially since tom and jerry doesn't lend itself to an actual feature film, at least in length. so the plot is as cliche as you would expect, the only down side is that you expect that cliched plot to focus on the titular characters.",low

7370,"one of the best scenes in cry macho involves sign language. it’s not even a scene, really; just a brief exchange of the short-but-sweet variety. i mention it because i wish more of the film were like that.

the two protagonists speak english, and yet there is a language barrier issue going on here. specifically, the actor who plays rafael, eduardo minett, makes you go for the 'mute' button almost every time he opens his mouth — the exception being when he falls back on his native spanish.

it’s not the young man’s fault, and it happens to the best of them; just listen to jean gabin in moontide, or javier bardem in loving pablo, or salma hayek, sofia vergara, and penelope cruz in any of their english-speaking roles.

now, i understand he’s playing a mexican boy who speaks english as a second language, and i’m also aware that his character is not meant to ingratiate himself with the audience immediately, of even fully — indeed, rafael remains largely unchanged and unwiser until the end, but i’d like to think this is by design; the film as a whole may be viewed as a short section of a very long circle, and mike (clint eastwood) and rafael’s intriguing next-to-last conversation foreshadows the latter character’s narrative arc eventually going all the way around to where he is as sensible, though presumably also as old, as his current companion.

we find out only slightly more about where mike is coming from than what we can guess at about where rafael is headed, but the one’s past and the other’s future are heavily implied in both men’s present; the irony is that rafael couldn’t skip the poor choices that await him any more than mike — whose admonitions fall, cassandra-like, on deaf ears; wisdom is earned, and non-transferable — can go back and avoid his own missteps. the movie’s events are thus, for lack of a better term, rafael’s preschool of hard knocks.

or maybe i’m just reading too much into it; perhaps this is just what my brain occupied itself with while i tuned minnet and his execrable english accent out. eastwood would have done well to make rafael as ignorant of english as mike is of spanish (or, why not, have rafael refuse to speak mike’s language until the conclusion, to the latter’s surprise, after finally having gained a modicum of the former’s respect), so there could have been more non-verbal communication.",low

after decades of experiencing so many films and understanding the respective industry, i rarely get extremely excited for an original sci-fi movie starring famous actors. i wouldn’t be surprised if chaos walking is the most anticipated film of the month for thousands of viewers, which isn’t an easy decision having in mind march is releasing tons of highly expected movies, such as raya and the last dragon, cherry, zack snyder’s justice league, godzilla x kong, amongst others. it’ almost impossible not to feel remotely interested in watching a film with such a phenomenal cast - tom holland (spider-man, the devil all the time), daisy ridley (star wars, murder on the orient express), mads mikkelsen (doctor strange, rogue one: a star wars story), demián bichir (land, the grudge), cynthia erivo (widows, bad times at the el royale), and more.

add doug liman (the bourne franchise, the edge of tomorrow) as the director and screenwriters with tremendously successful credits as patrick ness (a monster calls) and christopher ford (spider-man: homecoming), what could go wrong? well… almost everything. i possess no knowledge of the source material, but from what i could gather, the book trilogy of the same name was very well-received, which i don’t doubt for a second. if there’s one thing no one can take away from chaos walking is its incredibly captivating concepts and imaginative visual ideas. from the premise of people being able to hear men’s thoughts (noise) to the actual visuals of said brain activity, i felt deeply invested during the first act.

the futuristic setting is somewhat familiar, but the production/set design definitely set an engaging atmosphere. the score (marco beltrami, brandon roberts) also features interesting tracks that create a sense of wonder in this new world. unfortunately, this is as far as i can go compliment-wise. sure, the cast offers remarkable performances, especially holland and ridley, who obviously share most of the screentime as the underdeveloped protagonists, but sadly this is one of those movies where it’s hard not to find a significant flaw with everything. the lack of proper characterization is one of the main issues. while holland’s character misses a regular arc - he has no evolution whatsoever, ending the film with the exact same defects as in the beginning - ridley’s character raises dozens of questions that remain unanswered about herself, her past, her abilities, and her origins.

the new world presented to the viewers packs hundreds of unquestionably innovative and exciting ideas, but none reaches even a fraction of its potential. the “superpower” of hearing thoughts is rarely seen in a different manner other than chaotic, annoying noise, which is hugely disappointing, having in mind the scarce showings of its real power. nevertheless, the most frustrating component of the narrative is the introduction of massively important story elements that are completely forgotten by the end of the movie, namely - without getting into spoilers - an entire native population that remains as one of the most fascinating aspects of the screenplay that wasn’t remotely explained.

nowadays, people have more knowledge and understanding of how much studios impact the production of any film. honestly, i don’t know if this is one of those projects ruined by awfully dumb corporate demands or if doug liman and his team of writers screwed the pooch. one thing is for sure: director, screenwriters, and/or producers, they’re the people to blame for such a frustratingly terrible adaptation. i apologize to doc crotzer, but this is one of the worst editing jobs i’ve seen in years, though i want it to be clear: crotzer is far from being the sole or main culprit of such a horribly put-together movie. the camera work is also all-over-the-place (ben seresin).

finally, i don’t know if this following story detail is as explicit and barely explained in the source material as it is in this film, but due to the lack of any decent explanation besides “because”, i strongly dislike the whole “everyone can hear men’s thoughts, but no one can hear the women’s”. to be clear, my issue isn’t related to the idea but to its evolution in this movie. men, especially holland’s character, are shown to think like a primate with sexual thoughts concerning women and offenses to everyone and everything. men’s thoughts represent them as utter pigs. however, the whole “women’s thoughts are hidden from everyone” can easily be interpreted as “women don’t have brains”, especially considering the film’s failed attempt at elaborating this concept.

chaos walking will end up as one of the most disappointing, frustrating movies of the year. in addition to this, it’s also another entry in the list of “films with innovative, interesting concepts that fail to reach half of their potential”. besides the engaging production design, a cool score, and decent performances, any viewer will struggle not to find a massive flaw in every single aspect of the narrative. from the dozens of unanswered questions regarding daisy ridley’s character to the lack of a proper arc for tom holland’s role, the underdeveloped protagonists are just one of many screenplay issues. critical plot points and story elements either miss an explanation or are entirely forgotten by the end of a horrendously edited movie. transitions between cuts are very choppy and make zero connection between storylines. the whole “men’s thoughts are seen by everyone, but women’s thoughts are not” is depicted in a way that leaves men portrayed as pigs and insinuates women have no brains. i genuinely don’t know if this massive disaster is due to studio interference and/or to the director and screenwriters team-up, but one thing is for certain: personally, it's one of the worst films of the year.

7375,"in 2257 ad, the colonists of the planet new world, all men, have been afflicted with a condition called the noise, which causes everyone to see and hear each other's thoughts. judging by the level of intelligence the characters exhibit, this ought be a deafeningly silent planet. 

people who colonize a new world and literally call it ""new world"" can't have much in their minds (perhaps they should have called it planet faulkner, since everyone here seems to think in an uncontrollable stream of consciousness and/or has the mental faculties of a benjy compson). when sort of halo envelops their heads when they 'think,' it’s like the light is on but no one’s home. 

the only one here who manages to avoid appearing like a complete idiot is mads mikkelsen, and only because the danish actor is too smart to play this dumb; his character, david prentiss, is not particularly brilliant, but one can at least give him the benefit of the doubt — after all, he’s more insane than he is inane. 

prentiss is the only one who has learned to control his ""noise"", which shouldn't be too difficult; ever heard the expression 'think before you speak?' i don’t think it’d really be all that hard to 'think before you think;' these characters, however, are mentally incontinent. 

either director doug liman and screenwriters patrick ness and christopher ford are as dumb as the movie they've made, or they assume the audience is. for some reason, women can see and hear men's thoughts, but men can't see and hear women’s — making the “noise” nothing more than a clumsy allegory for female intuition.
this actually has to do directly with the lack of women in prentisstown (of which, as the name suggests, prentiss is the mayor), in a twist preposterous enough to make m. night shyamalan himself scratch his head in disbelief.",low

""clifford the big red dog holds cute, emotional moments that will tug at any pet lover's heartstrings, as well as the usual sweet messages destined to younger audiences, but it all comes at the cost of creating a deceptive, fake-looking world.

cgi clifford surprisingly looks decent, but inserting a digital dog in real sets while interacting with real people, leaves the viewers with a weird feeling that never quite goes away. unfortunately, the dog isn't the most artificial element of the movie.

besides being expectedly childish, incredibly formulaic, and exaggerated in every possible way, the characters and the main narrative are far from looking, sounding, and being authentic.

we see the memories of nick's clients as if they were home movies, which is very convenient but makes zero sense, considering that people don't remember things from a third person perspective; for example, if i wanted to remember watching reminiscence (fat chance), i wouldn't see myself watching the film. 

writer/director lisa joy tries, and fails miserably, to explain why we don't see her characters' memories from their own point of view with a ""demonstration"" by nick that proves absolutely nothing except that you can throw as much shit at the wall as you like, but that doesn’t mean it will stick. 

this is a less than auspicious debut for joy, who settles for projecting the usual fixations of her husband and his brother, jonathan and christopher nolan. 

at least in memento, as the name implies, the hero relied on reminders rather than memories per se, which are subjective and unreliable; in contrast, the memories in reminiscence are as pristine as the dreams in inception. ever hear of photographic memory? this is more like photogenic memory.",low

7425,"**an excuse for yet another cgi animated film.**

i think this movie shouldn't have been made the way it was made. the secret to the success of the first “space jam” was its originality and the way it combined the drawings and a real basketball star in a movie where he could play a little with himself. here, what we have disappoints anyone and only serves to raise money for the public without delivering a product that truly meets expectations.

the film's biggest problem is obviously its script: it all starts when lebron james, a basketball player, turns down a contract with warner bros. the contract was crafted by a computer algorithm that has somehow taken on a life and will of its own, and is determined to make itself noticed, even in the worst ways. by imprisoning the sportsman and his son in a digital universe, things get complicated. james will have to play basketball against the live algorithm, and he will ask the only one who might possibly have a good idea for help: bugs bunny. it is, as we can see, a basic script, very poorly written and poorly designed, which is not able to properly sustain the film.

i don't want to be mean to lebron james. he's not an actor, he's not expected to do a great job as an actor. i think he did a lot with what he got, which was pretty bad, but i also think he's not famous enough to support the movie the way air jordan did before. maybe he's famous in the usa! outside the us, no one knows who he is. don cheadle, thus, ends up being the most prominent actor in the film, even if in a machiavellian and tiresome character. cedric joe does what he can, but his character is terrible, and it was very poorly thought out. self-centered, selfish, vain and resentful of his father, the kid is nasty almost until the end.

technically, the film bets everything on the cgi of great visual effect and fails completely: if there's one thing that doesn't work well, it is the stylized and tiresome look of this film. i've acquired a special dislike for the computerized versions of bugs and the rest of looney tunes. they are terrible and ugly. there are things that shouldn't be modernized, so they don't lose their essence! in addition, the film has tiresome cinematography and is excessively long, with no script or material to fully justify it. i liked, however, the many tributes that are made to the films of the past of the warner studio: we have everything from “king kong” to “casablanca”, with the passage guaranteed by the “harry potter” franchise to “matrix” and “mad max”. it was the part of the movie that i found most sympathetic and honorable, but i still don't recommend this movie.",low

* love at first sight is a myth and is a very bad reason to kill or be killed. (intense attraction, curiosity, and lust at first sight, sure, but love takes longer.)",low

7450,"the real clash of the titans!

it was spectacular! the two iconic monsters in hollywood go head-to-head in an updated remake. both a sequel and a crossover!

the best part was when godzilla and kong fought in the city, with all them tall buildings. talk about classic monster fight! am i right?!
the second best part was when kong came to godzilla's aid and the two fought together against mechagodzilla, right up to the end where kong gave the final blow!
and yes, i am aware that i am putting a lot of exclamation marks in my review, but only because i really enjoyed this movie and they're my way of expressing of how frickin' awesome this film was for me! especially for personal reason...
it has been 4 months since the third lockdown here in the uk, 4 months of cinemas everywhere closed. and in the week that every cinemas reopened the first film i wanted to see was godzilla vs kong.

i admit that there were a couple of bits that would've improved; like more screen time from kyle chandler.
and that other guy was supposed to be serizawa's estranged son, but that was never acknowledged, despite the casting.
but other than that, not only was godzilla vs kong the first film i've seen since the cinemas reopened but also the best film i have seen, so far!",high
7454,"if you liked the movies with kong and godzilla, you will enjoy this, complete with cgi and monsters against humans. get your popcorn and soda and put your feet up, this is entertainment in every sense of the word. ⭐⭐⭐⭐",high
7455,"godzilla vs. kong is the biggest scam since batman v superman: dawn of justice. it promises a battle of epic proportions, but doesn't have the balls to give us a winner. the late introduction of mechagodzilla is meant to give the titular characters a common enemy, allowing them to put their differences – whatever these may be – aside and work together. they want to have their cake and eat it too.

the film tries to sell us on the idea that earth is too small for two “alpha titans.” it doesn't occur to anyone that it might be too small for just one; then again, given that both kong’s and godzilla’s presence lacks weight, mass, volume, and depth, neither of them can be said to take up physical space on the planet (not to mention that most of the ‘real world’ surrounding them has been as unconvincingly rendered as they have).

it is, however, during an expedition to the so-called hollow earth that the vfx department really blows its cgi wad. there is no excess they won’t indulge in, and yet it’s not enough to hide the fact that earth isn't the only hollow thing here – so is the script, which is unable to give us a single good reason why we should care about the skirmishes between a giant lizard and a giant gorilla.

you can't have two characters fight each other just because, no matter how ‘cool’ it might seem in theory; they must have a compelling motive, lest the audience loses interest in the outcome. this is such a basic concept that even the later, lesser rocky installments understand it. but here, godzilla and kong just don't seem to like each other very much; even tom and jerry, who at least are natural enemies, have a better excuse for their enmity.

to sum up, 1) we don't know why a primate and a reptile would want to fight to the death; 2) the explanation the movie provides doesn’t make sense (i mean, hollow earth? puh-lease!); 3) kong and godzilla are so phony-looking there is never any concern that they will hurt one another, however much they try; and 4) it's a foregone conclusion that neither is going to take a dive, needed as they are for the inevitable sequels. all things considered, why watch this movie when you can see peter griffin fight a giant chicken on youtube?",low

keitel's monologue during the grand budapest hotel concerning ""two poodles and blonde on a walk in the park"" when keitel suddenly erupts as the mastermind genius inmate of station 19 is one of the funniest surprises of that very funny movie.
this movie is certainly no rival for grand budapest because so few are, but just seeing keitel playing it straight for one of the biggest (and most prosecution-proof) gambling racketeers of the 20th century at a very late stage in his career is its own kind of fun.

i mean, i was confused at first by what the flashback was telling me, but halfway through the film, it started to all make sense!

i give it 5 stars, for basically going overboard with the rocket launcher mounted on a car, the editing for the flashbacks, bringing back two of the characters from tokyo drift, combining cheesy humor with outstanding action, the redemption, the post credit scene featuring jason statham! and of course the surprising return of han, and how he survived (the latter definitely had questions that needed answering).

""f9 takes its ridiculously absurd action sequences to intolerably nonsensical levels, all while trying to tell an overlong, messy, unimaginative story surrounding one of the most generic cliches. justin lin ignores the little balance that the saga still possesses in previous installments, delivering insanely dumb moments throughout entire set pieces, contrary to having a somewhat acceptable action scene with the occasional suspension of disbelief in a specific situation. daniel casey and lin are also unable to create a compelling narrative around dom's lost brother, ultimately damaging years of character development for vin diesel's role. bringing back han was as unnecessary as the unconvincing explanation for his return, hurting not only this movie's pacing and extended runtime but also the emotional weight of previous films. the original cast members and the exceptional production value are enough to save this installment from being a massive disaster. if you're able to (really) shut down your brain for over two hours, this might still be an entertaining time at the theater. however, even for fans of the fast & furious saga, i doubt this movie will end up as one of your favorites.""

seriously? 

i don't recall this being fast and furious. the plot was similar to earlier films and revolved around hobbs and shaw. the story was not exceptional in any way.

and, when it comes to action, it was unrealistic and unbelievable.
thousands of cars followed dom's crew, and thousands of guys with bullets and automatic weapons fired at them, but nothing happened to them. no one was hurt in any way. are they immortals? 

i felt the absence of screenwriter chris morgan as the structure and storytelling were sloppier to the overall detriment of the film.",low

7479,"you know a franchise has run out of ideas when it sends its characters to space. ""as long as we obey the laws of physics, then we'll be fine,"" tej parker (ludacris) tells roman pearce (tyrese gibson) as the two prepare to literally drive a car offworld — an odd statement, considering it might be the first time in nine movies that they even acknowledge physics and the laws that govern it.

f9 is no exception. right off the bat, roman finds himself in a predicament that even wile e. would find preposterous. following a miraculous escape, roman begins to suspect what cipher (charlize theron) seems to already know; that they are all characters in an action movie. sadly, the film doesn't pursue this direction which would be far more interesting than the long lost brother tale it settles for.

it turns out that dom toretto (vin diesel) has a brother, jakob (john cena). like the laws of physics, dom had never let on that this brother ever even existed. thus, we get a series of expository flashbacks to provide some background for this new character; you know, so that it doesn’t appear as if they just pulled him out of fucking nowehere.

these trips down amnesia lane are what truly sinks the movie. f9 uses the format popularized by the godfather part ii, in which al pacino plays michael corleone in the 'present' and robert de niro plays vito corleone in extended flashbacks.

now, diesel and cena are no pacino or de niro, but they are two unique individuals endowed with clearly defined personalities and who happen to ooze charisma and self-confidence. in comparison, the actors who play their younger versions are such non-entities that they almost make a good case for digital de-aging (almost). as a result of this, f9 loses all the momentum it has gathered in the contemporary scenes every time it looks back.

moreover, cena is too obviously a red herring; there's a reason he played a 'heroic' character in wwe for roughly 15 years, and it's because he couldn't be a convincing villain even if his life depended on it.

meanwhile, skilled performers like kurt russell, shea whigham, michael rooker, and helen mirror are wasted in peripheral roles (not to mention theron, who spends most of her screen time literally locked inside a transparent box, leaving us to wonder what she does when she has to go to the bathroom), the filmmakers seemingly operating under the impression that they must perforce make room for each and every character who has ever made an appearance at some point in the series.

apart from those already mentioned, we briefly see lucas black, don omar, bow wow, jason tobin, gal gadot, and jason statham in a cameo during the closing credits (unseen by me because once the credits roll, i’m outta there). about the only exception is of course paul walker (but not, as one might have reasonably expected, the one who had supposedly died in an explosion in a previous installment), whose character, from what we hear, has been reduced to babysitting dom's son and his own. is that the true fate of the furious?",low

7489,"the story of this movie is a pretty cool idea but unfortunately it is somewhat ruined by disney’s woke brigade.

i have to say that i quite enjoyed the first third of this movie even though said woke brigade managed to throw in some woke unnecessary bullshit about “white privilege” quite early but from there it went rather downhill.

the first third had plenty of over the top hilarious action in it. it was fun to watch. the parts where free guy learns to “level up” and kick ass where quite cool.

from there on it started to go downhill. the idea that millie should access some “hidden level” in the game to reveal evidence that antwan had stolen code from her is rather ludicrous.

speaking of antwan, can you say “over the top”? sometimes over the top can be fun but this guy was just cringey.

although there were still plenty of cool cgi effects in the latter half of the movie it was pretty much ruined for me by several completely unnecessary strongly sexual scenes. i do not need some guy touching another guys “boobs” in my films and i do not need any boob touching at all in a movie for all audiences. overall, at this point the movie becomes more an attempt at social engineering, propaganda and agenda feeding.

the ending? it was, not very surprisingly at this point, rather meh. to me the movie more or less ended when millie’s original level was found. the rest was just dragging it out with some rubbish about being able to do whatever you wanted and nonsense about there being so many people not wanting to actual play a game (shooter) but just mill around and watch. sorry, people wants to play games, if not to shoot things (which most people actually wants to do) so at least to do something. not just to watch.

also the rubbish with antwan trashing servers to hide evidence? the usual hollywood nonsense. no way anyone, even a game studio, running a game or service that big would not have back-ups.

**the suicide squad – introduction**
take the weirdest villains, give them an impossible mission, add some creepy humour, actions, colours and talent, and you get “the suicide squad.”
if some villains in 2021 try to improve and become better people, see cruella, for instance, we can’t say the same for our protagonists on the scene. they are looking to please the american government to gain some favour in return. however, some of them will surprise us with some good intentions and actions.it’s an exciting movie, spectacular in its genre and filled with dark humour and great character. so let’s dive into the story and some insights.

**the suicide squad – the story**
the american government organises a secret mission to take control of “project starfish” in the south american island of corto maltese. however, a recent coup overthrew the friendly american government and, the task forces created by intelligence officer amanda waller needs to destroy the laboratory of the secret experiment, jötunheim. colonel rick flag leads the first team that tries to enter the corto maltese’s beach. at the same time, the second team leader is bloodsport, an assassin who accepted the mission under the blackmail of the american authorities. both teams will have to strive and survive to accomplish the critical goal.

our heroes, or villains, needs to save the world from “starro the conqueror”, a dangerous weapon in the hands of the not trustable corto maltese’s government. but also prevent a tremendous international scandal that will destroy america’s reputation in the world.

will our team succeed with their mission?
what will be the price to pay?
and what is the difference between a not trustable regime and one which conspires against the world for its interests?

7499,"_the suicide squad_ is still one of my favorite films of the year. james gunn understood what the real suicide squad is, the great action, the violence, with a nice balance of heart and humor. the performances made this film a lot better. i didn’t expect that enjoy this film even on rewatch, and even put a spot on my yearly ranking, and i hope gunn makes more films like this.

7501,"what a surprise, after hearing such great things about this film for the past year i finally decided to give it a watch and it did not disappoint. james gunn is such a fantastically creative director, and it is shown in full force here. gunn is able to give each character their own artistic flair that makes even the most ridiculous characters (polka-dot man) memorable. the comedy is on point, like most gunn films, but there is a more brutal style of humor that is distinctly different the mcu humor that he has pioneered, given the r rating. i was pleased with the fighting choreography, with many unique kills i.e, the harley quinn escape scene. the plot is nothing special, but that is really in the background to the characters relationships that build throughout the course of the film.

**verdict:** _excellent_",high
7503,"the suicide squad is to suicide squad what mcdowell's is to mcdonald's. suicide squad had deadshot, the suicide squad has bloodsport. suicide squad had a computer generated anthropomorphic crocodile, the suicide squad has a computer generated anthropomorphic shark. suicide squad had a latino character who could control cgi flames, the suicide squad has a hispanic character who can control cgi rats. et-fucking-cetera.

these minor differences only serve to emphasize that the only real difference between this movie and its predecessor is a definite article in the title. even the quote-unquote new characters serve to preserve the status quo, as their introduction allows writer/director james gunn to repeat david ayer's formula from the first film: amanda waller (viola davis), who is clearly a bigger sociopath than any member of the suicide squad, scrapes the bottom of the dc barrel for characters who go from feeling sorry for themselves to feeling sorry for each other.

but there is something that the suicide squad has that suicide squad doesn't: an odd habit of unnecessarily doubling down. thus, we have peacemaker, who is interchangeable with bloodsport does. or weasel, a humanoid weasel who is interchangeable with pete davidson, a weasely human (davidson is possibly the only person more annoying than margot robbie; thankfully, his character gets his face shot off early on, which actually makes davidson less grotesque to look at than usual).",low
7506,"**where the first film was a good action movie with suicide squad characters, the suicide squad (2021) truly is a suicide squad movie in all its psychotic, unpredictable glory.**

while i am one of the few that really enjoyed the 2016 suicide squad, i can't deny that this movie captures the chaos, instability, and expendable nature of the squad in the comics. james gunn introduces the audience to a whole cadre of characters that are very deep cuts into dc lore with unknowns like polka-dot man, peacemaker, bloodsport, ratcatcher, javelin, and more. these obscure villains serve as perfect cannon fodder for amanda waller's hopeless suicide missions. these c-list villains almost scream that no one is safe. both new and old characters constantly die throughout the film. still, somehow gunn manages to make us care about these obscure and insignificant comic book characters making their deaths more potent and heartbreaking. he also knows how to direct harley quinn better than any director who has brought the character to live action. her insanity and charm are delightfully deranged and perfectly showcased repeatedly. with an army of bad guys, there is plenty of action and fighting to keep the runtime moving and put each squad member's skills on display. after what gunn did with the suicide squad, i am excited to see what he brings to the rest of the dc universe.",high
7510,"this movie ended up being quite unique and not in a good way. the uniqueness comes from the fact that i actually agree with the critics rating at that abysmally woke, leftist and useless site rotten tomatoes that this movie is not very good. that i agree with that rubbish site is rare indeed.

as a standalone movie i probably would have rated it higher but as a movie in the kingsman franchise i have to say that it was a disappointment.

the movie sets a quite different tone than the other kingsman movies. this movie is quite gloomy. the story, which takes the history of the first world war and the russian revolution and rewrites everything behind those events, is pretty ridiculous. the stories in the two previous kingsman movies was no masterpieces but this historical rewrite is just wrong. especially when playing with historical events that has caused more suffering than more or less anything else in modern history.

the coolness of the two previous movies is more or less gone. i cannot figure out if this movie tried to be serious or humorous but it fails on both accounts.

the duke of oxford’s overprotection of his son and his pacifism during most of the movie was just tiresome. what eventually happened to his son was rather predictable but the way they did it was like they where just trying to piss the audience off. incredibly frustrating.

then we have rasputin. the entire rasputin part was mostly alternating between silly and disgusting.

the duke’s maid/nurse was a nice part though although the actor was not really very good in the role. also, i am not sure that this “network of domestic servants” felt very plausible.

there were some outbursts of action that was not too bad. especially towards the end when the duke finally seemed to get his act together and drop this pacifist rubbish. i do however exclude most the world war scenes from the good action. they were just gloomy, sad and, at times, unrealistic and silly.

overall this movie was just so unlike the other two movies, and not in a good way, that i really did not like it. it was not really fun to watch. as i wrote it was gloomy most of the time. as it used the events leading to world war one and the russian revolution it was just one disastrous setback after each other. the only positive event in the movie was really at the end when the duke of oxford, founded the kingsman agency.

reading the synopsis one might get the idea about the kingsman agency being created and i hoped more of the movie would have been about the actual creation but the movie is really two hours of long winded often gloomy, sometimes silly, drama and then there are less than two minutes where the duke of oxford proclaims the agency created. not what i expected to be honest.",low
7511,"the king’s man is a mostly harmless movie, unless you, like rasputin, “consider being boring offensive”; if that’s the case, then you’re most likely going to want to demand satisfaction from co-writer/director matthew vaughn. this is an exceedingly long movie, yet it somehow can’t or won’t find the time or space to fit in a little logic.

consider the following. a group of british citizens go to moscow to kill rasputin, whom they believe to be a pernicious influence on the tsar – and that he is, but that doesn’t change the fact that rasputin remains the tsar’s closest and most trusted advisor. one would not expect the russian monarch to be too keen on continuing his alliance with england if he knew a bunch of english covert agents just assassinated, with extreme prejudice, his right hand man. fortunately he never finds out – or at least doesn’t appear to do so; the scene where the british cover up the murder and make it look like an accident or whatever has gone missing, presumably because it was never written, let alone shot.

having said that, i rather liked rasputin’s death scene, which recreates all manners of his fabled death (or, to be more specific, the myth surrounding it created by prince felix yusupov); poison, beating, bullet wounds, and drowning in freezing water. this, by the way, is not a spoiler; first because it happens halfway through the movie (and in this case “halfway” means there’s still a very long way to go), and second because his legendary demise is so well known it even has a trope named after it.

you know what else would not be a spoiler? the identity of the criminal mastermind behind the nameless organization – i would suggest owca (organization without a cool acronym), were it not already taken – intent on wreaking havoc upon the world; identity which i will not reveal because it should be readily apparent to anyone familiar with the law of economy of characters (in which a seemingly minor or unimportant character turns out to be much more crucial to the plot than they first appear to be). i will only add that the villain’s uncanny ability to impossibly go from point a to a point beyond the alphabet, aided by little more than the requirements of the script, produces a plot hole so big a submarine could pass through it – and literally does.",low
7518,"i found the original boss baby really good. great actually. unfortunately this one was quite a disappointing.

yes, there are a fair number of funny scenes and gags splattered around the movie. the chase sequences in the beginning of the movie are quite hilarious actually.

the story however is pretty lame. the original had a decent story. yes it was a bit outlandish but at least it was a nice family story. this one is nothing of the kind. the basic premise of the story is just silly and the way it is done has pretty much turned it into a education-and-competition-is-bad piece.

this father which is one of the main characters are generally behaving like a moron and when, in the middle of the action, he just wanders of like a bloody zombie to watch his daughter instead of pulling the bloody switch that would have saved everything then i lost whatever hope i might have had of liking this movie.

also, after that there was a repeated splattering of woke rubbish about how bad adults are, global warming nonsense and so on and so forth. sure, those images came from the so called bad guy but any one with common sense knows that they were really there to push the message. i find it really despicable when woke story writers cannot keep their agenda out of children and family movies.

as i wrote at the beginning, quite a disappointment.",low
7526,"i liked it very much, so i add my top ten to the already existing positive reviews. the film is great in its genre. after the first viewing, it seemed to me that the second film would be stronger than the first. duo hardy-harrelson = aerobatics. in the end, from the abundance of excellent jokes, my facial muscles ached (by the way, special thanks to the translators for the texts). i'm waiting for the continuation, it's very interesting to know what other capabilities venom will demonstrate.",high
7537,"i had to abandon this very early on, as i couldn't see anything. i'm pretty sure it was daytime, because kids were going to school, but it was so darkly lit that it looked like late dusk. i think there was a sun in the sky, but it might have been a firefly. i put my tv on ""vivid,"" but it couldn't remedy the problem. maybe there's a good movie in here, but the production is clearly broken, so if you have an hdr tv, you won't be able to see anything.",low

7545,"this is great! i loved it!

<em>'nightmare alley'</em> is a superb watch! i particularly enjoyed the beginning and end, which are truly excellent; the middle part isn't as strong, but is still top notch in its own right. i love the dark atmosphere it sets from the get-go, the sound design is outstanding - some bits are so striking and i love it! it has a quality, engrossing story to boot.

bradley cooper leads the cast with quality, though he isn't even the sole standout of the film. he is joined by a whole host of terrific performers: cate blanchett, rooney mara, toni collette, willem dafoe, richard jenkins, david strathairn ... i could go on, simply phenomenal casting! i wanted more of them all, and yet felt i got the perfect amount too.

the 150 minute run time went by incredibly quickly for me; if i hadn't known it was on for that long, i would never have guessed its length to be anywhere near that. it's a slow burn, but a slow burn done tremendously. guillermo del toro - this is the first film of his i've seen - & co. did a super job, i have no complaints at all. i was toying for ages between a 9 or a 10 rating, it just about creeps its way into the latter.

<em>'nobody'</em> is a supremely entertaining action flick. most of it actually feels fairly usual for a film of this sort, yet the way everything is presented is great! the pacing is perfection, the musical choices are fully on point and then you also have strong cast performances.

bob odenkirk is of course (rightly) super acclaimed for that role as a certain lawyer elsewhere, so it's nice to see him doing other things. he is superb in this from beginning to end. aleksei serebryakov also gives a good performance, as also seen in television's <em>'mcmafia'</em>. christopher lloyd and rza are fun, too.

7567,"i have to admit that this was rather painful to watch.

i have not seen any of the other oss 117 movies. the main reason i watched this one was because my girlfriend wanted to watch it. since she has seen the other two entries in the franchise (i have not though) and since this one takes place in africa and as she is from senegal she, of course, had a special interest in watching it.

myself, i thought since they have made three of these movies and since i’ve heard some people say they liked them i thought how bad can it be so last weekend we sat down and watched it. i guess i was wrong. for me, this was a bad movie.

it really tries hard to be some kind of spy movie (james bond ?) parody but it just becomes plain silly. most of the jokes are far from funny and the few that are funny are just mildly funny. oss 117 is so bloody stupid that it is not at all funny.

the movie is largely a political parody about the french and their supposedly “colonial” aspirations. political parodies are almost never entertaining and usually ends up offending someone so why bother? the hugely exaggerated “french mindset” is just bullshit. the africans are not portrayed much better and in the middle of everything sits the biggest jerk of them all, a pinnacle of stupidity… oss 117.

on top of everything they’ve made oss 117, well let’s just say sexually challenged, and when he finally get’s laid he promptly screws it up just by opening his mouth and let his insanely stupid monologues blurt out.

not surprisingly the story was bland and unimaginative not to mention predictable and the acting was overall substandard.

7571,"_red notice_ is a run of the mill spy adventure with twists, turns, and an inflated runtime that leaves the movie feeling bloated. i was having a decent time in the start of the movie, i enjoyed the back and forth between dwayne johnson and ryan reynolds, the set pieces were great, and the plot was somewhat interesting. but after awhile, the movie got stale as the same style jokes were recycled and the plot kept being strung along. all the acting was fine in the film, but by this point dwayne johnson plays dwayne johnson and ryan reynolds plays ryan reynolds. there is no diversity in their acting, every role they take on is the exact same. in the beginning it was fine, but too much of a good thing is not enough. i found myself getting increasingly bored throughout the duration of the film, and the ending was a grind to get through. the twists at the end were interesting, although if i was remotely engaged in the plot i could have spotted it from a mile away. overall, this film was below average cinema, even after the spending $60m plus on star power.

7573,"the many saints of newark is the sopranos meets the godfather part ii, and the result is so much less than the sum of its parts. do we really need to know that tony soprano was once a chubby brat? 

moreover, do we really want to know that that chubby brat grew up to be michael gandolfini? michael would certainly be a chip off the old block, if his father had been oswald cobblepot instead of jim gandolfini.

this is truly a case of the apple falling a million miles away from the tree, but then pretty much everyone here falls short of the original actors/characters (i was never really a fan of the tv show, and even i would rather watch that instead).

livia, junior, janice, paulie walnuts, silvio dante, big pussy; soprano diehards will recognize all of these and several other names , but not much else. the only connection to the hbo series is michael imperioli, and even then it's just his voice used as little more than en excuse for some lame retrospective dramatic irony.

when he sees tony for the first time, baby christopher starts crying his eyes out; someone takes the opportunity to randomly comment that “some babies, when they come into the world, know all kinds of things from the other side”. so baby chris could somehow sense that uncle tony was going to eventually murder him in cold blood? and if so, a fat lot of good that prescience did him. 

as for the audience, we (even casual viewers like myself) remember very well that tony soprano strangled christopher moltisanti (which means 'many saints', hence the title of the film), because it’s practically the first thing that imperioli tells us in the opening narration (to paraphrase borges, saying something too much is almost as bad as not saying it). 

writers david chase and lawrence konner and director alan taylor even manage to ruin the only good thing about this piece of crap movie; i.e., the late, great ray liotta, who must have been paid very good money — and completely deserved it for appearing in this debacle — because the filmmakers kill off his character half an hour into the movie, just to introduce his identical twin (and i mean identical to a t; how many pairs of twins are still getting exactly the same haircuts in their late 60s?).

7586,"i actually liked the two first g.i. joe movies, g.i. joe: the rise of cobra and g.i. joe: retaliation. this one… not so much.

it could have been a really good movie but it ended up as a huge disappointment. the story should have been a cool revenge story but it ended up being a convoluted mess making snake eyes one of the bad guys for most of the movie. it is also hugely predictable after the first 20 minutes of the movie. did the writers really think that the “twists” would come as a surprise for anyone? they probably did since hollywod writers usually reside on the low end of the intelligence scale nowadays. putting three of those hacks together to write a movie doesn’t help of course.

i could have accepted all of that if the rest would have been cool with lots of fights and special effects. sadly the movie is mediocre, at best, in these areas as well.

snake eyes is not only a bad guy but he is rather stupid as well as devoid of any charisma. his acting is quite poor which can be said for most of the actors actually. apart from the mediocre acting there’s really no one in the movie that you feel like rooting for. no one stands out, everyone just excels in mediocrity. the only person in the entire movie that has any coolness factor worth talking about is scarlett but she is not in the movie for more than a few scenes.

there are a few scenes with some special effects, cars flipping over, huge snakes etc. but not really that much for this kind of movie. that could have been fine since this movie should be a lot about martial arts. amazingly enough, not even here does it deliver. most of the martial arts scenes involve a lot of flipping around with arms and swords but they mostly look like they have been written for a pg rated tv show for teens and pre-teens. they are simply poor. tommy looks like he needs to take a dump before every fight with that ridiculous pose of his.

7600,"when i started watching this picture, i did not expect anything supernatural or something new, and as usual with films from the marvel film studio, it turned out to be right.

the authors of the script decided not to break the tradition and, as usual, took the path of least resistance, there are heroes, there are villains, they are fighting each other for the fate of all mankind. the plot revolves around the fact that a certain deity sends detachments of superheroes endowed with superpowers to protect intelligent life on different planets from evil predatory creatures remotely resembling ancient lizards, which they almost successfully cope with, but it turns out that the main characters fought absolutely the wrong evil and the main battle they are ahead. the first hour of the film is mostly banal chatter and shots telling about previous events, but towards the end there is an increase in the intensity of events up to an epic massacre of good and evil. the plot does not carry a global mystery and everything is clear from the very beginning, and small plot twists are guessed even before the viewer sees them. and judging by the finale, the audience will be fed one more, and maybe several films on the topic.",high

7604,"the eternals have lived on earth for 7,000 years. that’s a long time, but their movie somehow manages to feel even longer than that. now, if the eternals predate the avengers by a few millennia, and have been actively and openly involved in various periods of human history, where where they during the events of the last two avengers movies?

since those (mis)adventures had nothing to do with “deviants”, the eternals presumably couldn't be bothered to lift a finger. if that’s the case, why did they stay on earth so long after the deviants had supposedly been eradicated?

and if the deviants are at least as old as the eternals, why are they called after a word in a language that wasn't going to exist until eons later? this question actually has an answer, albeit a nonsensical one: as far as i can discern english is, for some unfathomable reason, the lingua franca of the universe, which of course includes both the earth and olympia.

one eternal even communicates with sign language, which i guess means she invented it. moreover, several eternals have an unambiguous ethnicity; are we to understand that they originated these, for lack of a better term, races on our planet?

or is it just a big coincidence that olympia has mexicans, irish, scottish, pakistanis, and south koreans? and speaking of inventions, it seems that ancient civilizations were more (or less, as the case may be) technologically advanced than we had previously thought; specifically when it comes to the cgi that they apparently used to build their cities.

this imagery that looks straight out of age of empires is the reason that eternals never generates the slightest sense of urgency (and if it did, it could never keep it up for the more than two and a half hours of running time).

who cares about the destruction of the world when the world in the first place is plainly phonier than a diploma issued by megatrend university? hell, the entire universe seems to consist almost exclusively of green screens.

how much respect or fear can arishem and the deviants respectively inspire or instill when they are nothing more than shapeless masses of pixels? all things considered, the only redeeming thing about this film is that it points out (unwittingly, i must assume) the arbitrariness of everything that has to do with the mcu: ""five years ago, thanos wiped out half the population of the universe ... but the people of this planet brought them all back with a snap of the fingers."" now imagine a 7,000-year long finger-snap.",low
7610,"dev patel is just as wrong for sir gawain as he as for david copperfield, but it's not his fault that the green knight is an incoherent mess; the responsibility lies entirely with writer/director/editor david lowery. 
early on in the film, king arthur (sean harris) tells gawain, ""tell me a story about yourself so i can get to know you."" gawain replies that he has no story to tell; two hours later he still doesn't have one save for a few disjointed episodes that ultimately equal less than the sum of their parts.

poor time management is another issue; it takes the movie a very long 15 minutes to introduce the green knight (voice of ralph ineson), but when he issues his challenge, gawain immediately jumps the gun without giving anyone else even a chance to turn it down. 

this situation, which offers great dramatic possibilities, is the one that lowery should milk for all that it’s worth; on the other hand, maybe he’s aware of how disappointing his green knight is and wants to get him out of the way as soon as possible until he inevitably has to reappear at the end.

sean connery’s green knight from sword of the valiant looks like the bastard son of santa claus and saint patrick, but at least he’s flesh and blood and played by an exceptional actor; that is to say, a million times better than the medieval groot that lowery comes up with.

this green knight is not just ugly, but also dumb. he carries a letter explaining the reason for his visit; this missive is read by the queen in a distorted voice, as if she was possessed or something; is the knight, whose severed head is capable of speech, speaking through her? and if so, what exactly is the point of the letter then? 

of course, after the frustrating resolution that resolves nothing (complete with an example of it's a wonderful plot, specifically the kind experienced by willem dafoe in the last temptation of christ) a better question would be, what's the point of this movie? 

this film is the product of a shamelessly shifty director; lowery not only casts a 'diverse' actor in the lead, but also resorts to queerbaiting in the form of a kiss between patel and joel edgerton (something similar occurs in the original  century xivpoem, so we’re hardly breaking new ground here). the latter of which is doubly reprehensible, because the way the kiss is misrepresented only succeeds in making gawain seem homophobic.",low
7620,"i have to say that this was a surprisingly good movie. i say surprisingly because marvel (or dc for that matter) have not exactly excelled in making even decent movies for quite some time. that the woke “critics” on rotten tomatoes gave it high ratings was a bit of a red flag as well but not only was the movie rather free from woke ramblings and preaching but it was a very fun and entertaining movie to watch.

the movie starts off in a somewhat bizarre way with shang-chi and his girlfriend swiping a car from a valet parking and going for a joy ride. it turns out that they are telling their story to a couple of friends and that is pretty much how this movie is told.

it begins more or less right away with some nice action and it continues that away with plenty of action sequences intermixed with story telling. the action and martial arts is really good in my opinion. they are in stark contrast to the mediocre rubbish we were treated to in snake eyes. the latter which was quite a disappointment.

this movie relies heavily on fantasy elements with tie ins to doctor strange, especially towards the end. another movie that i liked a lot by the way. thus there are of course plenty of special effects and cgi. most of them good or very good. i really liked the beautiful world of ta lo. the combat scenes, especially when the rings are in action are both cool and beautiful.

there are quite a lot of comical relief in the movie as well and, for once, it is not to silly, outrageous or plain stupid. it contributes well to the enjoyment factor of the movie. the washed out actor is a bit on the limit but otherwise it works well with the rest of the movie. that guy on the bus starting to film and make commentaries was quite hilarious for instance.

the story? well it is a marvel special effects movie so one should not expect too much but the story is not bad. it mostly holds together and works well enough to tie all the action together. the acting is pretty much the same thing. one should not expect too much but it is good enough. it was nice to see michelle yeoh as ying nan though. she was one of the few cool characters in discovery and she does know how to act.

overall i very much enjoyed this movie. it is a simple super hero and fantasy adventure story with lots of action and special effects and with the single purpose of entertaining the audience that doesn’t fall in the trap of trying to “educate” said audience.",high

""king richard is not only one of my favorite movies of the year, but it's also one of the best biopics i've ever witnessed.

the subject matter may speak more to me than to the average moviegoer due to my emotional connection to the sport, but it's the captivating story about a dedicated, loving father that ultimately grabs the viewers. will smith delivers one of the best performances of his career, as do saniyya sidney and demi singleton.

the sport is exceptionally explored, taking the audience through the immense sacrifice a player needs to go through to become one of the very best. technically, all filmmaking elements work together perfectly to demonstrate the physical and mental effort that tennis requires, dedicating a surprising amount of screentime to practices and matches.

nevertheless, the thematically rich screenplay surrounding family, self-belief, and parenthood takes the spotlight. i don't have a single bad comment to make about reinaldo marcus green's film.

i thought it did a great job showing the trials and tribulations of reaching the top of any sport, while also showing the side of a father wanting to protect his black children in a white man's world. it struck a really nice balance that felt genuine.

will smith is excellent in this role, one of his best in years. i can see why he was slam dunk to earn best actor at the golden globes. the rest of the cast did excellent as well, i was really impressed with the two girls and jon bernthal. bernthal has such a diverse range for acting, he severely underrated in hollywood.

the plot follows shy, ‘60s-aesthetic-loving eloise (thomasin mckenzie) as she leaves her small country home and heads to the big city of london to attend fashion school. after one bad night in the dorm, she decides to move into a room offered for rent by an older woman, miss collins (the late, great diana rigg). on her first night in the new room, eloise dreams of soho in the fabulous ’60s through the eyes of aspiring lounge singer sandie (anya taylor-joy). that first dream, in which a wide-eyed eloise watches the confident sandie secure an audition from jack (matt smith), is a true marvel. the swapping between eloise in her pajamas and sandie in her flowy go-go dress as they twirl with jack is a beautiful technical and choreographic achievement. the flawless re-creation of the flashy lights and neon signs of soho in the ’60s deserves immense praise. presented on its own, that first dream sequence is a delight.",low

when people ask me my favorite genre, i usually reply with the admittedly annoying and cliche ""i enjoy every type of film"". while this is ultimately true, i do tend to love sci-fi and a couple of other genres more than the rest. i find sci-fi to be one of the most creative filmmaking sources, partially due to the infinite potential of its storytelling. from extraterrestrial life to an exploration of deep space, our world knows so little of what's beyond our planet, which makes the respective genre a perfect framework for imaginative, unique fiction. voyagers features an interesting cast, but neil burger was behind the disappointingly hollow divergent saga, so i couldn't help but go in with very low expectations.

even anticipating a tough watch, i never thought voyagers would be a contender for one of the worst flicks of the year. the general premise is far from being groundbreaking, even with the not-that-original spin that it puts on the ""colonization of another planet"" concept. still, it's considered a formula because it worked on several other occasions. it just doesn't in this movie. the group of young people bred separately from the outer world could have received an innovative, inventive arc but instead follows an incredibly generic, dull, lazy character development path. the chaos and mayhem triggered by a single person - who just so happens to embody literally everything that's wrong with our society - is as extremely forced as it is utterly ridiculous.

in fact, it even raises logical questions regarding the premise of the film. obviously, people can be born into the same place with the same education, morals, and everything that comes with growing up and still develop a distinct personality. however, burger doesn't demonstrate why some characters end up challenging the authority and questioning their purpose. everything happens because it needs to happen. a character performs an irrational action because the plot demands it. most of the story development is given through absurdly childish dialogues, where a character repeatedly asks ""why?"" to someone with some sort of an answer.

burger's screenplay barely survives due to the lack of any exciting characteristic. from an obviously misleading subplot to the frustratingly predictable main narrative, this movie carries zero surprises. the horrendously choppy, abrupt editing work (naomi geraghty) turns an already complicated watch into something borderline irritating. add weirdly creepy, nonsensical imagery of random life events on completely arbitrary points of the runtime, and voyagers becomes a really hard film to genuinely enjoy. with no flow between scenes, the primary mission is lost in the first minutes, and the characters fail to complete any resemblance of an arc.

actually, it's ironically funny how isaac hempstead wright (bran stark in game of thrones) continues the trend of not doing anything relevant in a movie or tv series. unfortunately, not even the cast saves this disaster. tye sheridan (dark phoenix), lily-rose depp (crisis), and fionn whitehead (dunkirk) try their hardest with the poor scripts, but some line deliveries are truly cringe-worthy. colin farrell's (the gentlemen) character suffers from one of burger's numerous bad decisions, ending up as yet another forgettable component of the film. the ending arrives way too fast, something that attests to the way too fast pacing.

in these cases where i struggle to find positives in the two pillars of any movie - story and characters - i turn to the technical elements to help me out. sadly, voyagers is one of the rare one-location films that doesn't feel suspenseful or claustrophobic, despite many efforts. from the surprisingly ordinary score (trevor gureckis) to the by-the-numbers camera work (enrique chediak), there's not a single aspect i can take with me as an ""at least that was great"" thought. i guess the set design looks futuristic enough for a spaceship, but once again, it's nothing viewers haven't seen before.

voyagers holds a well-known, successful sci-fi formula and takes it through the most uninteresting, unsurprising, frustratingly generic development path. neil burger's screenplay fails to deliver a creative, captivating story with compelling characters, offering the complete opposite. from the terrible editing work to the extremely lazy plot development, passing through cringe-worthy dialogues and randomly weird, irrelevant imagery, it's tough to find a positive aspect in such a hollow movie. even though most of the runtime is spent in a single location, the suspense levels are close to zero. the themes of the story are clear from the get-go, but the execution of almost every plot point or character action feels incredibly forced. the set design is the only technical component worthy of some appreciation. not even a talented cast can overcome the awful scripts. a contender for one of the worst films of the year.

judas and the black messiah was a last-minute addition to this year’s sundance, which basically changed every list about the most anticipated films of the festival, including my own. the buzz surrounding its oscar chances, the remarkable cast, and mainly its important narrative based on true events were more than enough reasons to generate an undeniably powerful hype. when i watch movies inspired by real people and/or true stories, i want them to teach me about the historical moment they’re depicting. i want to finish my viewing sessions and know more than what i did at its beginning. i want the film to be enlightening, thought-provoking, and, most of all, impactful.

i’m just a young white man living in portugal with no previous knowledge of who fred hampton was or what he did. the closest i got to learning something about him was during last year’s the trial of the chicago 7, but that movie wasn’t even focused on the black panther party, let alone one of his most important revolutionaries. my voice is far from being meaningful in regards to this film, and i will share black critics’ articles that i find to be worthy of investing your time in reading. however, i do have an opinion about this movie, and i’m in my right to share it. i find shaka king’s flick to have all of the qualities i mentioned above and much more. one of the best films of the festival, and i’m not risking it by writing it will end up as one of my favorite movies of the year.

in all honesty, i found myself struggling to completely understand fred hampton's intent during the first half or so. his goals are clear and can be summed up in simply trying to offer everyone a better life, one that was fair and where everyone was treated equally. my issue wasn't in his motivations or beliefs, but on the violent, murderous path that hampton was *apparently* inciting people to take - i repeat, i didn't know a single thing about the real story nor hampton himself. however, daniel kaluuya's very first words as the character stuck with me until now - ""we're not gonna fight fire with fire, we're gonna fight it with water. we're not gonna fight racism with racism. we're gonna fight it with solidarity. we're not gonna fight capitalism with black capitalism. we're gonna fight it with socialism"" - and he kept developing this idea, which i find incredibly timely.

the scene that ultimately cleared my perception of hampton's ideas was when william o'neal takes the latter's most famous speech at the end of the second act in its most literal sense, which leaves hampton baffled and shocked at o'neal's interpretation of his words. hampton's reaction, as well as a more emotional moment with the mother of his child, deborah johnson (dominique fishback), was the click i needed to fully comprehend the revolutionary's desires. this is one of the best compliments i can offer shaka king and will berson's exquisite, detailed screenplay. it doesn't make hampton a flawless superhero that never makes mistakes but instead depicts him as a human being who fought for everyone's rights. the latter is closer to being a messiah than the former.

the intricate narrative might feel a bit too heavy for some viewers, but it packs extraordinarily energetic, inspirational, chill-inducing speeches that i won't forget that soon. both hampton and o'neal raise sensitive themes that will definitely leave the audience thinking and discussing them throughout the year. despite it being the longest film of the festival, its two-hour runtime feels adequate and well-paced. in addition to this, the terrific, ""in your face"" cinematography (sean bobbitt) focuses on the actors' performances, not giving a chance to the viewers to be distracted with anything else besides the characters' words. the emotional investment in the characters elevates the well-edited (kristan sprague) shooting sequences that left me on the edge of my seat (couch), which ultimately serves as a huge praise to the movie's writing.

i left the cast for last. now, i know 2021 just started, but if daniel kaluuya isn't nominated in every single awards show for the respective best supporting actor category, i'll riot. i've yet to witness a less-than-great display from this unbelievably talented actor. kaluuya is exceptionally captivating from the very first time he shows up on-screen and never drops his level. lakeith stanfield is also brilliant as a conflicted william o'neal, delivering an extremely complex portrayal of someone who has to deal with actions he knows are wrong. dominique fishback and jesse plemons (roy mitchell, an fbi agent) also deserve a shoutout.

judas and the black messiah deserves all the hype it’s been getting and some more. shaka king and will berson deliver a film inspired by true events with all the qualities this type of movie needs: enlightening, inspirational, thought-provoking, and tremendously impactful. boasting what i’m sure will end up as one of the year’s best performances (daniel kaluuya), the story of fred hampton and william o’neal is told through an incredibly captivating narrative, filled to the brim with absolutely epic, riveting, chill-inducing speeches and dialogues that will leave no viewer indifferent. both characters bring timely themes back to the spotlight, hopefully generating a critical discourse regarding freedom, human rights, and equality. besides kaluuya, lakeith stanfield deserves massive praise, and i can’t forget about the lingering, character-driven cinematography that elevates every single scene. final shoutout to mark isham and craig harris’s unforgettable, addictive score that plays a significant role in the narrative.

rating: a",high
7650,"'judas and the black messiah' (a bloody brilliant title that took a while for me to figure out) is a true powerhouse of a film - not just because it echoes the current climate and the black lives matter movement, but for its standout performances from lakeith stanfield and daniel kaluuya and its fantastic direction from shaka king.

7653,"_bones and all_ is one of the most unique movies i have ever seen. it somehow simultaneously disgusts me while filling me with intense emotion capable of drawing tears to my eyes. it is a perfect blend, that i was unaware that i needed.

the journey our characters take in immense in terms of emotion and distance. i had such a great time watching our leads travel across country going wherever their hearts desired or wherever their noses took them. there were some creepy and intense encounters that had me on the edge of my seat but that was balanced with intimate moments between our leads. these scenes fill the majority of the 2 hour and twenty-minute runtime, and while that is a decently long film, it flew by, and the pace never seemed to lull. there were some scenes that could have been cut to save some time, but i argue that they were essential for character development and to make the film whole.

throughout the course of the runtime there are intense introspective themes of morality that are at constant play. watching the characters balance desire and need was so heartbreaking and real. despite the horrific acts our main characters are performing, there is a deep hidden shame that seeps out as our character learns more and more about what she is.

these are very complex emotions to handle on screen and our two leads absolutely nailed it. both taylor russell and timothée chalamet were brilliant! i will be honest, timothée chalamet is one of the big reasons why i wanted to see this movie so much and while he did an excellent job, he was outshined by taylor russell. she was so excellent, honestly perfect! this is the first film i have seen her in, and i was blown away. she deserves all the award recognitions for this film.

7658,"owen wilson better be careful lest he becomes the go-to for aging latino milfs. last year he managed to save bliss from salma hayek’s strident overacting, but he has no such luck with jennifer lopez in marry me. 

now, to be fair, the movie’s failure is not her fault, and she acquits herself a lot better than hayek did; it also helps that lopez is essentially playing herself – a mega popstar with a string of failed marriages. and whereas she isn’t an acting prodigy, nor is, for that matter, maluma, who plays her temporary fiancee, they are nevertheless performers who know their way around a stage and are extremely comfortable in front of an audience.

it’s no surprise then that the only genuine moments in marry me take place during a sold-out show – that is, of course, until kat valdez (lopez), having discovered, right before they are supposed to tie the knot in between musical numbers that bastian (maluma) has been unfaithful, has what can only be termed as a psychotic break and decides to pick out a random dude from the audience and marry him on the spot instead. let’s put it like this: this plot is too outlandish even for wilson, and he has been in several wes anderson films.

the reason that charlie (wilson) is at the concert is pretty random itself; parker (sarah silverman), her friend and colleague – they are both teachers, or at least he is a math teacher that, as it often occurs in the movies, has only a handful of students in his charge; she on the other hand mostly appears to just hang around the school –, planned to attend the show with her girlfriend, but her girlfriend broke up with her, so she asks charlie to come and bring her daughter along. 

ok, so this is the hottest show in town – sold out, as i mentioned above –, but parker just happens to conveniently have a third ticket available; still harder to believe is that her girlfriend didn't wait until after the concert to break up with her.

anyway, that very same night kat is already the butt of jimmy fallon’s jokes on the tonight show – which is obviously impossible because the tonight show doesn’t air live; in fact, it is taped in the afternoon and broadcast hours later.

just as fast as our characters achieve their dreams of being stars in the industry, these dreams are quickly whisked away by the brutality and cutthroat nature of hollywood. this is juxtaposed with brad pitts character, a man already on downward spiral of his career, trying to desperately hold on to what remains. these arches are so honest and vulnerable, i found very compelling.

the performances were top notch all around, and i would expect nothing more from a stacked cast of actors including margot robbie and brad pitt. but the surprise of the bunch was diego calva. he was fantastic and stole many scenes he was featured in with both robbie and pitt. he is the true lead of this film and does an excellent job bearing the load.

i really enjoyed almost aspects of the film, but towards the end there are some sequences that i feel got away from chazelle. they are so over the top and kind of feal out of place in this somewhat grounded story. the tension is there in these scenes, but it just doesn't fit. this whole subplot could have been shorten tremendously helping reduce the bloated runtime of the film.

that being, i never really felt the length of this picture with it being quite well paced. overall, this movie was real treat, and it is quite a shame that marketing was jumbled up so poorly because this film deserves viewership.

already in the first scenes i was going what the f… is this? are they turning the franchise into a comedy?

thor himself has been turned into a rambling moron. the rest of the gods are either unbelievable assholes or fat slobs only caring about their orgies or some combination thereof. most of the movie i was just cringing in my seat.

if they were actually going for more of a comedy movie than an actual thor movie they failed miserably. the “jokes” where unfunny, unintelligent and just bad. superhero slapstick at best.

the only character that i found remotely likable and cool in the movie was king valkyrie. jane foster was not too bad either. the rest was just a joke. the portrayal of the mighty god zeus and olympus was an affront. the bad guy was not too bad although i would not call him likable of course. he is not supposed to be likable. at least he was not turned into a parody.

it is really a shame because the underlying story is not half bad… if it had been given to someone with actual talent to implement. it is predictable of course but it is okay. if it had only been given to someone who could have turned it into a real thor movie instead of this failed comedy turd.

i have to admit that i did not have my hopes up very much when starting to watch this movie. given what disney has turned into i was afraid that they were literally going to turn thor into a female and luckily that did not happen. unfortunately they found another way of ruining the franchise. this movie is nothing like the previous thor movies. i really liked thor: the dark world for example. to me this movie is very close to a franchise killer.

7719,"**by: louisa moore / www.screenzealots.com**

“don’t worry darling” isn’t the massive mess that so many predicted, but it does suffer from a few major problems. the script (written by katie silberman) lacks grace and polish, one star’s questionable acting skills is amplified by the other lead’s performance, and olivia wilde‘s direction is noticeably weak. but there’s still something mesmerizing about this feminist-tinged film and its commentary on the supposed ideals of a patriarchal society.

alice (florence pugh) and jack (harry styles) live a charmed life in the experimental utopia known as victory. the town is exclusively for employees of the top-secret victory project and their families, and it’s truly the most perfect place in the world — or so it seems. company ceo frank (chris pine) is the visionary behind it all, a stylish, confident leader whom the men all want to emulate. he provides everything the town’s residents need, asking only for loyalty and obedience in return.

victory is a place that embodies the idyllic 1950s life, where the women cook and clean, dress to perfection, and spend their free time day drinking, lounging by the pool, and gossiping with friends. the men fulfill their role in this society too, by going to work at the mysterious headquarters and returning like clockwork in the evenings. it’s a don’t ask, don’t tell type of community, until alice begins having strange, nightmarish visions. she begins to explore the more sinister side of victory, hoping to eventually expose what’s really going on beneath the facade of domestic bliss.

the plot is one that’s been done before, and there isn’t much by way of originality. what makes the first part of the film so successful is that the story is told from the point of view of the women in town. by presenting the narrative through the lens of an army of happy homemaker wives, there’s an ominous tone throughout — especially when the ladies in town turn to self-harm in order to take back control of their lives.

alice is a strong female character, and pugh proves yet again that she’s one of the most exciting talents working in hollywood today. much is asked of her and she is up to the task of doing the heavy lifting here, especially in her many scenes with styles. to put it bluntly, pugh acts styles under the table and then some. i believe the film would have been more successful with a more talented leading man.
when the ending finally comes through a long drawn out reveal, it’s a letdown that feels like an episode of “black mirror.” if you examine some of the film’s earlier scenes, the story doesn’t feel quite as airtight as it should.

the themes are excessive and overdone, presenting the conservative male ideal of relationships and life. it’s a chilling statement about women’s rights and responsibilities, and men’s desire to control and dominate. the timing for this message couldn’t be more perfect with the tumultuous political climate that’s spreading around the world. as a woman, i appreciate the sentiment of “don’t worry darling” and the feminist lens in which its presented, but i just wish the film had been more successful overall.",low
7723,"they said it and you wont hear me disagreeing with it. did i find it entertaining? ""nope"". did  i feel the story was cohesive and comprehensible, with a clear contextual message? ""nope"". were characterisations relatable and relevant? ""sort of"". 

nope's characterisations are moderately relatable but somehow, also seem to appear oddly misconstrued. the mostly monosyllabic cowboy character, for example, only adds to the sense of ambiguity (perhaps that's the idea).to my mind however, this ploy, if that's what it is, stifles development, of the already ambiguous, story line. the sister, his complete antithesis, is superficially verbose but seems equally, to lack any depth of self awareness.

the only thing i can say conclusively about nope, is the visuals are  compelling, complex and, at times, almost intricate. this film certainly scores a a+ in this regard. 

that said, so much else is lacking, in particular a clearly articulated narrative, that it failed to resonate, with me.

i felt they didn’t go for the melodramatic approach here as they well might have. they merely hinted about moments like one of them wondering if a car occupant was watching her, and used just one threatening phone call when they probably actually had many of them. it kept the story cleaner and moving forward.

she said reminded me of all the presidents men, with the two investigative reporters being held to a standard of having sufficient sources to back up their reporting but where woodward and bernstein seemed mostly concerned with holding people accountable for their illegal actions, the journalists in she said connected and formed a personal bond with the victims they located and encouraged to speak out.",high

important subject matter doesn’t always translate to a good movie, and “she said” is a botched attempt at retelling the true story of two new york times reporters who took down the infamous hollywood abuser, harvey weinstein. it’s something with which the industry is very familiar, and the years of sexual misconduct that the two women uncovered is horrifying. it was one of the most important articles to ever run in the newspaper, but this story would be better suited to the page and not the screen.

the film follows writers megan twohey (carey mulligan) and jodi kantor (zoe kazan) as they investigate the miramax movie mogul, trying repeatedly to get big name actresses to go on the record to expose weinstein’s gross abuse of power. instead of offering new insight, director maria schrader uses the same old newsroom clichés to create a pedestrian investigative journalism film. it’s procedural, boring, and repetitive, with a series of scenes featuring the two leads making phone calls, writing or reading text messages, and sitting in editorial meetings. of course, this is less than interesting because the story isn’t cinematic: it’s dull.

the film touches on the more interesting aspects of working as a woman in hollywood, as many of weinstein’s victims refused to be named on the record because they were terrified they’d never work again. this did happen more often than not, and he either bought or forced their silence. perhaps if screenwriter rebecca lenkiewicz had decided to focus more on the personal dilemmas and fallout his victims faced rather than only briefly touch on them, this would have been a stronger and more powerful movie.

even worse, the film doesn’t feel timely. the decision to tell this story now seems dated and past its expiration date. women will always remember the #metoo movement and it will go down in history as one of the most important feminist campaigns of the 2000s, but many of us would rather forget about weinstein while he rots away in jail.

here’s where my biggest problem with the film comes in: the story leaves a really bad taste in my mouth, especially when you stop to realize that many of weinstein’s employees, friends, and peers either aided in covering up his crimes or even worse, willfully looked the other way. harvey’s touchy nature and treatment of subordinates was the worst kept secret in hollywood circles. he was as creep, and many who met him were uncomfortable being in his presence. it feels a bit disingenuous (or perhaps just a bit ironic) to make a movie about it, even if the story’s focus is on the two reporters.

the better parts of the narrative inspire with the proof of the power of journalism to encourage change, and kantor and twohey absolutely played a huge part in giving women who were victimized the courage to come forward. mulligan gives a strong performance, but it’s a shame she didn’t have an equally robust script to work with. both of the leads feel wasted, especially when they are called on to do little more than rattle off facts and name-drop big actresses who came forward to expose the year of abusive behavior by weinstein. none of this is a substitute for compelling drama, and “she said” fades into the void of forgettable procedural journalism films.",low

this new film feels like it’s trying too hard to be one of the original _scream_ films when it should have just been more of its own thing. this is something the film addresses, but originality should always triumph over retreading familiar territory; especially when it seems like its kills are being plunged into the same stab wounds.

i loved the first scream - the surprise, the shock, the self-awareness, the humor. it reinvented horror and launched a franchise of sequels of varying quality. and this newest one is the best since the first! it captured all the fun of the first. it kept the stakes high by bringing back the original cast and proving that no one is truly safe. the directors had fun baiting the audience with every slasher trope they could. tense music would rise every time a character walked past a dark doorway or opened a cabinet to hide the view from the hall - naturally, that is when the killer is standing on the other side but not in scream! playing with the tropes in a fun, self-aware way is what scream is all about, and matt bettinelli-olpin and tyler gillett nailed it.",high

7771,"redeeming love looks great. it features great locations shot with great cinematography, but that’s about all director d.j. caruso can do to entice us to keep watching. it’s terrific to see a story unfolding in a non-cgi, true-to-life setting, even if it’s cape town standing in for california (but then some of the greatest westerns were filmed in europe, so there’s that), but while this movie arguably achieves the western look, it fails to conjure up any sort of western feel.

the script concerns a hooker with a heart of gold known as angel, who is so sought after that the local madame, who calls herself duchess, holds a daily raffle to determine which lucky slack-jawed gold miners – there is more than one winner per day – get to hold sexual congress with her. this is such a cumbersome arrangement that it actually gets in the way of the plot, so that co-writers francine rivers and caruso hand wave it not long after they have introduced it.

so-called “dirt farmer” michael hosea becomes smitten with angel, so what does he do to get near her? does he buy all the numbers in the raffle? does he have the raffle rigged? no and no; he simply “pays double”. that’s it. why this hasn’t occurred to at least some of the yokels who form a daily scrum outside the brothel is anybody’s guess. another good question is where michael, who is not a miner, finds enough “gold dust” to gain access to angel on three different occasions.

angel wants nothing to do with michael owing to a deep-seated hatred and distrust of men, which is established in a series of flashbacks that are so many and so long they could make up an entire, separate movie all by themselves. they are also the reason that redeeming love unnecessarily breaks the 120-minute mark. but the oddest part about these flashbacks is that they show angel escaping a life of compulsory whoredom only to enter a life of voluntary whoredom. twice. maybe even thrice, but that last time is once again against her will. in any case, it gets to be quite repetitive after a while.

it is only after angel gets the tar beaten out of her by the duchess’s lackey magowan that she relents and agrees to marry michael – but first he has to pay off her “debt” to the duchess, and the irony that he literally buys angel off in order to make an honest woman out of her is lost on michael and caruso alike.

redeeming love’s greatest achievement, other than its photography, is how well it masks its biblical pedigree. according to wikipedia this is a “christian western” based on an homonymous novel by rivers (unread by me, though it wouldn’t surprise if she had first published it under the pseudonym f.r. ancine), which in turn is inspired by an obscure old testament book – not that you would even guess at any of this by watching the movie, and that’s actually a good thing. it may be long and boring, but at least it’s not overtly preachy.",low
7772,"at the risk of sounding like a purist, jackass forever is one comeback too many. i’m aware that expecting purity from this franchise is akin to drawing blood from the proverbial stone, but even when taken on its own terms, it’s safe to say that there is no jackass without bam margera and ryan dunn – just like there wouldn’t be any jackass sans johnny knoxville or steve-o. to its credit, jf doesn’t try to replace the irreplaceable, but it does attempt to fix what’s not broken by injecting ‘new blood’ into the cast (come to think of it, it's definitely broken, and it doesn't get fixed either).

thus, we get a new fat guy, even though the old fat guy is still around (and still round). why? you already have a fat dude; you don’t need two fat dudes. similarly, with the likes of dave england, known for his ability – if one can call it that – to defecate on cue, what need is there for a dave england-lookalike named poopies? all of this makes as much sense as having another little person on set other than wee man – and again, i know that ‘sense’ doesn’t enter the equation here, but just because the performers are dumb enough to do what they do to themselves, it doesn’t mean that the fan base, among whose numbers i count myself, is too dumb to have its intelligence insulted.

there is no point in introducing newcomers this late in the game, especially considering that, as jf makes abundantly clear, watching random strangers suffering grievous bodily harm isn’t all that funny; ironically, it’s much funnier when it happens to people you have come to know and actually like over the years – and even then the novelty has doubtless finally worn off (and it certainly had a damn good run); there is a lot more deja vu in the proceedings than there is nostalgia. all things considered, i was considerably more entertained by knoxville’s match with sami zayn at wrestlemania 38 than by jackass forever.",low

in the second part, i face many challenges: will the second part be better than the first part, or at least equal to it? secondly, yes it presents us with a group of stars with beautiful charisma on the screen.

this time, the events of the film take place during the pandemic. this time, the main investigator, the hero of the story, is facing deadly boredom due to him staying at home all the time due to the pandemic and the lockdown. this is what drives him, without hesitation, to participate in one of the games organized by a rich person. this game is to solve a crime, hypothetically a crime that didn't happen in reality. this invitation reaches the investigator and some close friends of this rich person, but during their arrival to the place of the invitation, we begin to discover many mysterious things.

the first is how the friends get to know each other. each character is completely different from the other character, a rich person, a youtuber model, a scientist, in addition to a political figure and an investigator. we begin to discover, by starting the conversation from the beginning, that there is a suspicious or unhealthy past for each character, but the most important thing is that it is far from the game and the hypothetical investigation. we begin to discover real crimes in the place of al-daghwa, and now everyone is a suspect, and through the story we will learn who the culprit is.

yes, i am almost certain that the characters of the second part will continue on the same path as the movie of the first part. what i did not like about this movie. yes, they showed us the motives and reasons, but i could not get behind any motive in them, and in these types of stories, the most beautiful thing is that it shows that you made a mistake about who the murderer is, not only in deceiving you, but showing you that your deductions were wrong, makes you doubt one or two or three people, and in the end you discover that all your doubts were wrong. in this part, i was not able to doubt anyone.

yes, it is true, there are many good plots in the scenario, and there is good manipulation, but i cannot be certain that i doubt any character, as if i was waiting and seeing the events for the vision to appear. i could not participate in the game, which is very important in this type of movie. in addition to clarifying things, there were many coincidences to the point of being so ridiculous. the only reason some mysteries and some indicators were discovered is that the character, for some reason, was present at the right time and the right place without any actual intelligence to find the information.

_this film was screened at the toronto international film festival_

writer and director martin mcdonagh is no stranger to creating stories that find humor in darkness. in fact, it’s arguably what he does best. with his latest film “the banshees of inisherin,” mcdonagh captures the sadness of a breakup between two longtime friends with his signature darkly comedic, cynical tone. it’s an emotional character study about loneliness and isolation that expertly blends humor and cruelty, and it’s one of my favorite films so far this year.

set on a fictional remote island during the irish civil war of 1922, the film tells the story of buddies pádraic (colin farrell) and colm (brendan gleeson), two men who find themselves at an impasse. it all starts one day when colm unexpectedly and abruptly decides to end their friendship, offering no explanation and leaving his former pal stunned and saddened. with the help of his sister siobhán (kerry condon) and the troubled islander dominic (barry keoghan), pádraic plans to do whatever it takes to repair the estranged relationship. his repeated efforts to reconcile annoy colm to the point that he delivers a shocking ultimatum, which in turn escalates the petty feud to an alarming standoff that could have violent consequences.

working from an outline of a sad breakup, mcdonagh’s script flows with a natural rhythm that’s brimming with sharp wit and wry, dark humor. this isn’t a complex narrative, but the dialogue is impassioned and poignant with a genuine understanding of the human condition. mcdonagh’s writing is like no other, with a natural talent that’s enviable. the script plays directly to the specific strengths of his cast, too.

featuring oscar-caliber performances, gleeson and farrell strike the perfect harmony as colm and pádraic. their rapport is natural and relaxed, and there’s a comfortable feeling between the two actors which no doubt stems from being reunited with mcdonagh. this trio should continue to make movies together because something magical happens when they do. condon and keoghan are also excellent in this story of conflicts, as siobhán grapples with the realization that she may risk dying from an unhappy and unfulfilled life if she continues resisting her her urge to flee, and dominic must deal with the mental suffering of being worn down by his abusive policeman father.

the strongest supporting turns come from the scene-stealing animal actors, who represent loyalty and unconditional friendship in a story that’s peppered with a dark undercurrent. even as the humans around them struggle with their worlds falling apart (and a civil war raging nearby), their equine and canine companions keep them grounded. one of the most memorable scenes features a touching moment between a miniature donkey and a horse, and it is one that absolutely destroyed me. it’s moments like these that add up to a fiercely affective film that is adept at delivering a highly emotional experience to the audience.

not only is mcdonagh an effective writer, but he is also a talented director with a knack for capturing and creating a mood. working in tandem with his cinematographer ben davis, the film is filled with stunning photography and astonishingly gorgeous scenery of coastal ireland. these desolate landscapes lend a natural beauty that in turn creates a strong sense of place, providing the perfect backdrop for the story.

but a lot of it is done right, it features an interracial family but doesn't make the race a key part of the story.  in fact, it doesn't even mention it at all.  instead it follows the story of a little girl and santa. 

and the santa is a bit weird, there is a lot of things that just don't fit with his character, but that doesn't matter because the story is just so fun that you willingly suspend most of your disbelief.

it is violent and does a great job of making the violence both exciting and at times comical.  it drops easter eggs in some of the best possible ways.  not all the men are evil and idiotic and not all the women are practically perfect in every way.  they are just written as, well, as unique characters.

and you really have to appreciate it in 2022 when most movies drop characters for checked boxes.  

it was probably the only movie that you could go into in 2022 and just be entertained by.  that was the clear intent in making this and that was the end result.

the action bits are overall quite good but this is hollywood with their armada of clueless script writers so sometimes they get a bit ridiculous. like being able to hang on to the outside of a bullet train while it speeds away.

it takes a lot for a film to surprise me, and i love it when one does. “bullet train” is chocked full of so much stylish, bloody, violent fun that it reminds me why i love movies in the first place. director david leitch brings a confident, creative vision to his guy ritchie-meets-gareth evans-meets matthew vaughn-meets quentin tarantino style that’s rambunctious, frenzied, and in your face. while some will detest this sort of mayhem, many fans of the genre will join me in enthusiastically screaming, “shoot this into my veins!“

unlucky assassin ladybug (brad pitt) is tired of the brutality. he’s back for another job, but has pledged to work peacefully and without a weapon. ladybug has been tasked with retrieving a silver briefcase from a high-speed train in japan, which seems simple enough. fate steps in, naturally, putting a damper on his well-intentioned plans. the train is filled with the most lethal adversaries (and one deadly snake) from around the globe, and they all want the same thing. chaos ensues in what may be a literal last man standing scenario.

based on the book by kôtarô isaka, the film takes place almost solely onboard a train, but it never feels claustrophobic. despite tight close-ups and many dialogue-heavy scenes with questionable writing, the cast (including joey king, andrew koji, michael shannon, and hiroyuki sanada) keeps things engaging. brian tyree henry and aaron taylor-johnson as a pair of professional criminals are particularly entertaining, and pitt exercises his movie star chops with great aplomb. the storytelling is terrific (one of my favorite bits is the tale of wolf, which is wonderfully executed), even if everything doesn’t quite come together as well as it could.

this is also a gorgeous looking film. jonathan sela‘s colorful cinematography is alluring, with a richness that elevates every scene. leitch is skilled at directing action scenes that are thrilling, and fights that are well choreographed. even the cgi is exciting.

the film reaches just the right balance between action, violence, and humor, and it’s one that i cannot wait to revisit. from the killer soundtrack to the rapid-fire visual storytelling, there’s a lot going on at all times. if you’re not paying attention, you’re guaranteed to miss something. i feel this one could benefit from subsequent viewings. plus, it’s been a long time since i’ve wanted to rush back to re-watch a movie the second it ended.

“bullet train” is a film that will prove to be an acquired taste. it’s the type of movie that you’ll either love or loathe, with very few landing somewhere in between. it’s illogical, confrontational, and it’s sometimes evident that the film trying too hard, but i found it easy to overlook the flaws because it’s just so damn entertaining. talk about a nonstop thrill ride.",high
7838,"so this is romancing the stone, only it's romancing the stone where wilder shows everyone all the time to make a statement that is really the same statement that every other movie has been making nonstop for the past 6 or so years, flopping as a result about, and then blaming the people who didn't go see it after they were told it wasn't made for them and thus realized it was going to be just like all the others.

and it was. we have seen this so many times it spawned a cliche about going broke.

the characters have no chemistry because they aren't supposed to be real people, they are supposed to be checked boxes interacting with other checked boxes.... yawn... like every other movie and tv show made in the past few years.

the plot is boring because people have seen the movie it is blatantly ripping off of, and because of that, they have seen the plot work in a far better movie that doesn't put political statements above entertainment.

any movie directed by darren aronofsky contains a lot of violent scenes that are unfamiliar and hard on the eyes to see. darren aronofsky is a director whose work must be eagerly awaited because one of his films, requiem of dream 2000, is one of my favorites.

the most important event in the movie the whale is the star brendan fraser, after suffering from many health problems, especially with the spine, and was forced to perform surgeries, in addition to the withdrawal of lights and fame from him, and his playing movie roles that didn't achieve wide success.

brendan fraser played a terrible role that deserves an academy award due to his genius performance, and you do not expect this wonderful acting performance from him, especially since he is an actor who is very good at comedy roles. he did a lot of dramatic work, but he didn't reach perfection like the one in the movie the whale.

this amazing drama was like a oneman show although the other actors did well but the main reason for my admiration for the movie is brendan fraser. it was the make-up and the way the breathing was unbelievable and it's mind blowing how someone can pull off such a role

the film was shot in only one location, with the exception of the flashback scenes. sadie sink it was provocative from the first minutes, getting on your nerves and pushing you to throw something on the visual medium through which you watch the movie, whether it is a mobile phone, a laptop, or even in theaters.

_this film was screened at the toronto international film festival_

when thinking about “the whale,” i feel it’s important to start at the end rather than the beginning because the melodramatic finale almost ruins everything that’s good about the film. the finale is grossly manipulative, corny, excessive, and if what came before wasn’t so great, it would diminish director darren aronofsky’s entire project. thanks to a heartbreaking script (from writer samuel d. hunter) and a once-in-a-lifetime lead performance from brendan fraser, it takes little effort to overlook the film’s more negative aspects.

based on hunter’s 2012 play of the same name, the psychological drama tells the story of charlie (fraser), a reclusive english professor who is living with severe obesity. weighing over 600 pounds and unable to leave his home, charlie spends his days alone in his small, dingy apartment with intermittent visits from his friend and nurse liz (hong chau), who is his only companion. it’s been an interesting week for the man, as he’s had two additional unexpected visitors: a religious missionary (ty simpkins) who is compelled to continue his visits, and charlie’s estranged and hostile teenager daughter, ellie (sadie sink). with his health in grave decline (he repeatedly refuses to seek care at a hospital), charlie decides to do everything in his power to gain one last chance at redemption in his daughter’s eyes, and every ounce of time he has left is spent reconnecting with her.

the film takes place in a confined space, and the lead character spends the majority of his time sitting on a sofa. this cramped setting feels suffocating, which in turn conveys the feelings that charlie is also experiencing. this is a story about empathy, and it’s admittedly challenging at first glance to feel a ton of compassion for charlie no matter how accepting you may think you are or claim to be. his outward appearance is shocking and repellant, and it’s part of human nature to look at him as if he were a freak show attraction. what’s interesting about the film is that it digs deeper beneath charlie’s obesity and lets you into his heart. i was surprised to find by the end of the story just how much i had grown to care so deeply for him.

folks who have seen the film and are crying that it is “fat shaming” are missing the point. this isn’t a story about humiliation or degradation, it’s a film about actually seeing the person inside a repulsive exterior and giving them humanity. this is not a project that mocks obesity, as has so often (and sadly) been the case with many hollywood films. this is a story with substantial and challenging themes about depression, mental illness, and addiction. in this case, charlie has spent years self-medicating his despair and unhappiness with food, and is now suffering from an eating disorder that has raged out of control.

none of this would be so emotionally touching if not for fraser’s lead performance. he is impressive and outstanding as charlie, and it’s one of the greatest cinematic performances in years (and definitely of the actor’s career). it’s not the spectacle of the makeup or fat suit that makes him memorable: it’s how fraser thoroughly embodies charlie with a deep, soulful pain in his eyes. his performance absolutely ripped my heart right out of my chest to the point where i found it difficult to breathe. he’s _that_ good.

while there’s been so much talk about fraser, chau’s performance is equally heartbreaking. through her facial expressions and body language, you can see and feel the pain charlie is causing liz. everyone is simply waiting for the man to die, and you’re right there by liz’s side as she cares for her best friend in a final act of selfless affection. it’s an agonizing thing to watch and experience, and chau conveys her torment in an understated, poignant way.

if it sounds like this is a tough film to watch, i will assure you that it is. you won’t leave the theater floating on air when it’s over. this is an adult drama that will leave you in tears with its story of resentment, vulnerability, regret, and humanity. that’s also why “the whale” is one of the very best films of the year.",high

7859,"men, directed by alex garland, is a movie that fails to live up to its potential despite having some redeeming qualities.

the cinematography is fantastic and haunting, with creative shots that add to the overall experience. but this quality dips towards the end, with the director focusing more on horror elements in the tune of slasher/home invasion instead of psychological. the sound design is excellent, and the sinister feel really adds to the movie's overall mood. the acting is good, but nothing too spectacular. no performances really blew me away. however, the body horror in the movie is fantastic, and it had the hair on the back of my neck standing up. even though i do think it is not entirely needed, i have to give props in that department.

unfortunately, the script is pretty dreadful. the message is very in your face, overly complex and did not work for me. it was quite a turn off too, as it seemed as though the director was trying to say all men were the same and were terrible human beings. i know it had deeper meaning than that, but that surface level message is undeniable. i mean honestly, every person she encounters is such a massive piece of shit, not one person would have held out a helping hand? 

something that did really bother me was that the movie starts off as a creative psychological horror, but takes a spin in the third act that divulges into body horror mixed with slasher elements, which really takes away from the intriguing first 45 minutes of the film. combine that with dreadful pacing, which will result in the audience feeling like they're waiting for the movie to be over. 

overall, men is a forgettable movie that had potential, but unfortunately, failed to deliver in many aspects.

7866,"say what you will, the original jeeper's creepers films, especially the first one, were master classes in budget horror.

everything that came after, hasn't lived up to the original. jeepers creepers reborn, is, for my money, just another off the shelf, rather mediocre, knock off. 

the story largely overlooks the factors that made the original film, so compellingly chilling. the slowly building tension, the gradual realisation that the pursuer is something worse than a garden house variety serial killer. in other words, the film ""creeps"" up on you. 

this film plays more like a run of the mill slasher flick, without the jump scares. the results not frightening or even a little chilling. 

i'd describe everything else as ""alright"", from acting, sets through to 
horror effects.

""uncharted is an action-adventure flick, but despite a more entertaining last act, it fails to break the curse of videogame film adaptations due precisely to the lack of said action and adventure.

even though tom holland and mark wahlberg offer good performances, as well as convincing arcs by the two protagonists, ruben fleischer delivers an extremely generic and formulaic narrative based on endless exposition. additionally, the secondary characters become irrelevant due to the irritatingly repetitive betrayals and constant shifts of the true antagonist.

in the end, the general feeling is that it would be much more interesting to be controlling the characters than simply watching them. it may be enough for fans of the franchise, but for the average moviegoer, it's ""just one more"".""

7895,the movie is all action but without special computer effects (at least none that are over the top like almost all hollywood movies in last decade). it's all killing and blood with some unrealistic scenes but still a lot better than hollywood stuff of last decade. no woke stuff here. definitely worth watching for hour and a half of entertainment without political or social propaganda.,high

i also love words that have no direct translation to english, like the portuguese word soldade, or the german schadenfreude. now i've learned another, the finnish word sisu: a white-knuckled courage and unimaginable determination.",high
7912,"i can’t help having a soft spot for a movie that name-drops several pro wrestlers as a means to convey a nice bit of subtle foreshadowing, and plays warrants «cherry pie» on its soundtrack like every five minutes.

on the other hand, it’s very difficult to empathize with the characters in this film; anyone who climbs a rusty, super creaky 2,000 foot tv tower (a choice so inane that under normal circumstances it’s known as the fallacy of the climbing villain) in the middle of bumfuck nowhere just for shits and giggles deserves whatever’s coming to them. 

the rationale, such as it is, behind the protagonists’ actions is that life is «too short» and «you gotta do something that makes you feel alive.» methinks they’re confusing joie de vivre with having a fucking death wish. according to these people’s logic, bobby de niro and chris walken were really sucking the marrow out of life in those russian roulette scenes from the deer hunter.  

now, that climbing artificial structures (known as buildering as well as several other names) is a reckless (not to mention illegal) thing to do doesn’t necessarily mean that those who do it take it lightly. i’m sure a lot of planning and prepping and getting in shape mentally and physically (even the relatively simple act of climbing a ladder becomes a herculean labor when the ladder is twice as tall as the eiffel tower) precedes the actual deed.

we don’t see any of that here; not even a training montage. for hunter (virginia gardner) and becky (grace caroline currey) it’s an overnight decision; sure, hunter says she’s has «planned» it, and she’s some sort of daredevil you tuber, but becky is an out-of-practice rock climber who has ostensibly become a drunken slob in the year since her husband’s disney villain death. 

all of the above notwithstanding, the film certainly makes the most of its chosen setting. the landscape around the top of the tower (consisting of a «pizza-size platform») betrays a green screen quality to it, but this is a rare occasion in which this actually works in the movie’s favor; at such dizzying heights, wouldn’t the world and everything in it look surreal? or, to put it more bluntly, wouldn’t your perception get all screwed up? 

moreover, the stunts don’t flat-out take your breath away, but they do kind of borrow it for a little while, which is better than nothing; also, there’s a certain measure of suspense regarding whether or not help is on the way — and while this is the only movie that i can think of where the audience is left literally waiting for the other shoe to drop, this aspect of the plot actually involves a pretty neat shot of, well, a shoe dropping.",low
7915,"going into fall, i did not have super high hopes, and unfortunately it met my expectations. this movie attempts to be something far greater than it ever needed to be, resulting in a super bloated experience that just feels completely unfocused. the nearly two-hour runtime is entirely too long for a plot that is on the surface, fairly bare bones. but the screenplay attempts to deliver multiple subplots that are supposed to develop our characters, but all it did was take away from the tension that it was building. for every scene where i was gripping my chair waiting to see what will happen next, there is a scene where the two characters talk about their feelings for far too long. furthermore, there are story elements that are either too convenient or exist solely as obstacles for the sake of obstacles which detract from the overall believability.

i do think grace caroline currey is going to have a fantastic future in this industry, but her performance alongside virginia gardner left a lot to be desired. currey did her best to save a pretty horrendous script, but it just was not enough. despite this, the movie was directed fairly well, with great shots of the tower and of the action that was ensuing. the cinematography was fantastic, with beautiful skyboxes and sharp silhouettes of our protagonists that i particularly enjoyed.

that sense of unknown really added to the thick tension that this movie brought throughout. there is a paranoia that occurs with both the audience and the main character. you never know who to trust, even if they give you all the indications that they are trustworthy.

in today's horror cinema, it is rare to see a movie so reliant on building tension rather than just jump scares galore. not to say that this film does not have any jump scares, but they are there to enhance and bring a crescendo to the long scenes of tension and dread.

overall, the acting was brilliant. georgina campbell was fantastic. bill skarsgård was a bit awkward at times, but i do think that was by choice, as his actor was a kind awkward sweetheart. justin long stole the show. his character added a bit of lightness and someone who the audience can really root against.

without giving too much away, barbarian feels a little like the hills have eyes, meets psycho, meets quasimodo. the problem here is the scripting and handling. its takes far too long for this story to get off the ground, it has weird, nonsensical plot holes and the reveal comes far to early. 

whats left almost feels like a second film. it leaves only a reiteration of the essential earlier plot line with a few wrinkles, as the film moves towards its rather icky, conclusion.

of course, any sense of fear and tension, built up subtly in the first part of the film, is dissipated too. you know what's coming.

in summary, this film feels like it borrows from other horror flicks, in the worst possible way, leading to a disjointed but predictable viewing experience that's neither all that scary or even terribly interesting. the only thing propping it up, is the acting, which is of a high standard. yet, as i've said more times than i can count, that on its own, is not enough.",low

why? i rate any movie based on a few things. warning! potential spoilers.

**1. story**. is the story compelling, does it stick in your mind after the movie, haunting you like a ghost, forcing you to think about it and even your own life? does it have any positive messages aka moral of the story.

the story of the way of water is indeed compelling. the conflict is multifaceted. family conflict, human-na'vi conflict, tribal conflict and most importantly, personal conflict, aka identity conflict. the identity conflict is mostly fuelled by outcast feeling. there are a lot of people including jake who at some point feel like they don't belong. i believe most people feel this way at some point in life, you don’t need to be in the protected minority groups for you to feel like an outcast. and while we may not be accepted for who we are, defining who are begins with ourselves first. our world is full of people who want to be identified in one way or another. but have they identified themselves first? just remember, most people feel discriminated for one reason or another in life. religion, gender, skin colour, country, body size or smartness in school, political affiliation. nobody gets love all round all times. know who you are and don’t fuss to much about it. learn a losson from spider (miles socorro).

**2. characters**. are there likeable characters you can get attached to? characters you remember later, characters that inspire. characters that grow.
spidey is a new character, and he has a great story to tell. jake has changed a lot too and for good reason. people undergo a lot of transformation in life. you can’t be what don williams calls a rake and ramblin’ man your entire life. i read an article review complaining how jake tucked his tail and ran. that review completely missed the point. jakes decision may not have been the right one, but put in his situation, it is a decision that a lot of people would make. 

**3. acting**. is the acting good? is it realistic enough to be believable to a point you forget the people are just acting? i was more than impressed by neytiri’s “gone nuts” scene. i felt her pain, and in that instance, i was nuts too. i honestly forgot this was just a movie. actors can make you cry, and that is just how it should be. you forget that it is just an act, no need to cry. i also read an article that complained about the dialogue of the teenagers. i don’t know what the reviewer expected. philosophy from teens? their conversation is believable enough for their age.

**4. everything tied together**. a good story told by good and believable characters needs a setup. something to tie them together into a bundle.  avatar ties everything together with wonderful visuals. i don’t need to say more.",high

this was the best looking movie i’ve ever seen.. and no other film will match this in the future that isn’t an avatar sequel. the vfx on the characters and creatures was perfect, no problems whatsoever. sometimes some landscapes might have looked a little off, but the worst looking shot in this movie still looks better then almost every other cgi heavy action film. the underwater sequences  was awe inspiring, i could’ve watched the underwater sequences in this film forever. the amount of work put into the underwater sequences definitely paid off. at first i wasn’t so sure about 48fps, during the first 20 or so minutes, i thought i would be detracted the whole time, but i wasn’t, i adjusted about half an hour in, and was completely emerged into a film like i never have before. 
the action in this movie was insane, the action was always at and 11 out of 10. you felt the scale, the weight, the stakes. 
like i said, this wasn’t a perfect film. when the movie started, i was so sure about how i would feel about this movie. it starts voiceover heavy and with lots of quick cuts as if a lot has been cut from the film within the opening, im sure there will be an extended cut to this, and i’m curious if it will add to it. the dialogue in the first film was the best, and this film does have stronger dialogue. but there are still a couple scenes where it did feel a little off, but it was mostly with the younger characters. as it wasn’t constant, it was just like a line here to there every 20 minutes or so. while, i did say that the opening needed a little more to it, there are chucks in the middle that didn’t need to be there, and was just there to be eye candy, but it wasn’t really a big issue with me, cause it was some of the best eye candy ever put on film.
i’m tired of people complaining about the story to these avatar films, it feels like people put the plot to these movies on a unrealistic standard. the plot here is basic, and yeah, it might feel a little to basic at times. but i don't really think it was something worth mentioning critically. 
overall, this was a perfectly crafted film with a pretty good script, that provided a theater experience i’ll never forget.

7951,"_the gray man_ has some impressive action sequences, but is such a lackluster film experience overall. most of the action is bogged down by sloppy editing where a complete absence of proper lighting ruins whatever positives the film had going for it. the talented cast does what they can with their roles, but it’s not enough to make the film entertaining. ana de armas is mostly forgettable apart from shooting tranquilizer darts in guy’s butts and firing a rocket launcher a few times. tedious and sluggish with punches and kicks and kills that barely satisfy, _the gray man_ is a dead on arrival action thriller that squanders potential almost as often as ryan gosling chews gum.

anyway, putting aside the predictable effort to set up this nasty little three letter acronym as virtuous, there's not a lot going on here.

its your usual rather heavy handed, cruel, cynical, us action flick.

exposition is polished but then it needs to be, because there's not a lot else on offer that i can see. suffice to say, instantly watchable and just as forgettable.

7958,"what an excellent sequel - i, in fact, like it more than its predecessor.

<em>'top gun: maverick'</em> is fantastic, simply put. i was expecting it to be good, but it's actually much more enjoyable than i had anticipated. the callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational.

the story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given i'm not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. it's all super neatly put together, i honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.

tom cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of maverick, while miles teller comes in and gives a top performance. jennifer connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given kelly mcgillis' [unexplained] absence.

monica barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though i actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something i thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it's done nicely; sure jon hamm and glen powell are a little cliché, though overall i approve.

a great watch - i'd highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven't already.",high

""top gun: maverick is the return of pure, nostalgic blockbusters, instantly becoming one of this year's personal favorites. the best aerial action sequences ever amaze even the highest expectations, not only due to the absolutely insane real stunts but largely because of the flawless contribution of all filmmaking elements.

the surprisingly emotional screenplay helps tom cruise deliver one of the best performances of his career. perfect editing is essential to creating such realism, as well as raising the tension levels for one of the best final acts within the respective genre.

and, finally, the memorable score loaded with epic tracks makes the theater experience the only way this magnificent work should be seen.

i never thought, a sequel from 80s hits movie would be exceeding its predecessor. tbh i thought this movie would be suck and will be getting the fate like the matrix resurrections and robocop remake. but boy i was wrong, this movie is the definition of awesomeness in cinema.

let me start with the story. this movie doesnt have any complex story and some of it structure if im looking at it, kinda almost the same as the first one. but is it identical? yes? so it means they just copying it? no. what i mean is peter craig did take a few ideas from the first movie for a few scene (i think its a homage for the first movie) but the context has alot more meaning than the first one tbh.

now scoring, lorne balfe did great job for remaking the top gun anthem... damn it feels good hearing that theme again... and also, i want to applause onerepublic and lady gaga for creating such an awesome soundtrack for the movie

now lastly for cinematography and visual effect, its probably the first time in my life i got out from imax and said ""i paid 10$ dollar for this movie? i feel like i should've paid more. this movie is too good"". the sound design, the real action from fighter jet, the bloodpumping visual. it all works together creating this masterpiece. its been a decade since i feel this immerse on the movie.

this is the reason why movie theatre was created, now go watch it on imax. trust me, you'll never regret it.**",high
7973,"top gun: maverick had a ton of praise when i finally got around to watching it and it did a relatively good job living up to it.

my main two complaints from the original have been entirely corrected in it's sequel: cheesy dialogue and terrible shot selection in the aerial sequences. the script has been vastly improved upon with updated dialogue just all around better acting than the original. there were not corny lines or interactions that felt awkward. the aerial combat sections are incredible, they are done with such precision and purpose. i could actually understand what was on and where the fighter crafts were in relation to each. these raised the stacks and hade me fully invested.

the overall story is pretty great. i loved how the recruits were training for a final ""suicide"" mission, instead of just graduating from the academy. the dynamics between tom cruise and his superiors/students were great and felt witty and genuine. the continued relationship with iceman was touching as they seem to have a real connection that has lasted throughout the years, although i thought his illness and they way they presented it was a bit out of place. my one big complain his cruises love interest. this plot really has no impact on the story and is just thrown in there for old time sakes. i did enjoy their chemistry together and it was cute to his interactions with daughter. but, i watched the original directly before this and was utterly confused on who she was. it was really odd to have a throw away line in the original be the main love interest in the sequel, but like i said, it did not have a huge impact.

the performances are spectacular in this film. tom cruise and miles teller are standouts and their back and forth is really fun to see, delivering some funny jabs but some series dramatic moments. jon hamm was great as a hard ass commanding officer. glen powell was a standout as well, his cockiness and rivalry with rooster was great but complex.

this film is a blast, and i really wish i would have made the time to see it in theaters. i really enjoyed this and i am definitely not one who fancies these types of films, but it captured me.

maverick is a patriotic action movie with a male lead that doesn't make the male lead look like an idiot.  the white guy isn't evil.  america isn't evil.  it's a sequel that doesn't trash the heroes of the first film or attack the fans.

from start to finish it's just a solid apolitical action movie.

so of course you are supposed to hate it, it literally breaks all the rules of modern hollywood.

and that was why it was the biggest blockbuster of the past few years.  that is why it had returns that would be a mega-bock buster pre-covid.  it's the type of movie that people actually want to see, which is why it's under attack on certain sites.  you're not supposed to know that people like it and they weren't supposed to make a movie that people wanted to see.

everything has to be a propaganda piece.  

but you want to know a secret?  if this came out in the 80s it wouldn't have done well.  it's not as good of an action movie as they had back then.  it actually sort of sucks compared to a lot of the classic action movies of this genre.

but then it came out in 2022 and the rules have all changed.  today everything is racist or far left.  so what you have here is a movie that is great... by 2022 standards... simply because it's not the crap that hollywood is shoving down your throats and demanding that you like.",high

""the batman deserves all the hype it generated and then some. matt reeves delivers a distinctly darker, more intense, frighteningly realistic noir thriller than past adaptations, with an aggressively vengeful bruce wayne / batman and a fear-inducing, mysterious, lunatic riddler.

greig fraser's cinematography - bone-chilling ""ins-and-outs"" of batman and stunning footage of gotham - and michael giacchino's score - genuinely addictive, elevates the entire film - make this adaptation the best-looking and best-scored cinematic version of the batman ever.

even with the narrative focus on the detective work, the action sequences are exhilarating and beautifully shot. the entire cast is extraordinary, especially paul dano and robert pattinson - the latter destroys all skepticism around his talent.

apart from a short period at the end of the second act, the three hours fly by. it's one of the best movies of the year and a fair contender in the debate of best comic book movie of all-time.""

7987,"_**""our scars can destroy us, even after the physical wounds have healed. but if we survive them, they can transform us. they can give us the power to endure, and the strength to fight.""**_

ever since it was announced that matt reeves was going to direct the batman after ben affleck stepped down for personal reasons, i had no doubt he was going to put on one hell of a masterpiece. this is the definitive live-action batman. an epic 3-hour film noir that delves deep into comic lore of gotham city.

robert pattinson perfectly embodies both bruce wayne and batman. i love the character arc he goes through, realizing gotham doesn't need vengeance to heal, but hope. zoë kravitz plays a phenomenal selina kyle, you actually feel her emotions throughout the movie. another plus is that she actually feels integral to the plot (unlike the dark knight rises). paul dano is a terrifyingly realistic interpretation of the riddler, using the internet to gain a fan base for his sick games. andy serkis plays an excellent alfred, being bruce's emotional support during dark times.

the soundtrack by michael giacchino is absolute god-tier. elevating every scene with emotion and sometimes dread. finally a score to rival danny elfman's iconic score. matt reeves direction is impeccable as always, getting some nice shots while also making it feel nice and claustrophobic around batman.

overall, a god-tier batman movie that i can't wait for the cinematic universe that's being made around it as i type this.",high
7990,"this film is so intricate, there's so many details, things you can obverse on multiple watches and not have noticed on your first. there's a lot of things that just aren't spoken that give this film so much substance. so many layers and nuanced story telling. gotham city feels as it should, as it's own character and a visceral cesspool of corruption and just dirt. it feels dirty, unpolished... it's amazing.

there's so many shots in this film that are just simply breathtaking and intentionally dirty. it helps capture this visceral tone and fits substantially well with the universe of batman.

being a diehard fan of batman for, like, pretty much all of my life- i have to say; matt reeves absolutely nailed it with a completely faithful adaptation of batman. not once in this movie did he do something i felt was completely out of character and robert pattinson solidified the performance of both bruce wayne and the batman. i love matt reeves went to the extent to make sure this batman doesn't kill, as other directors have seem to give less care to. yes, even nolan. it should have to go without saying that batman does not kill, that's a no-brainer, but for decades this has been a problem in batman films... and finally, it no longer is a problem. that's how you do it.

bringing this review to a conclusion, this is easily my favourite batman film. so many things about this film just feel like it's pulled straight out of a comic book. i mean, riddler flooding the city itself is pulled straight from zero year and there's so many nods to comic moments and members of batman's rouges gallery. matt reeves knew what he was doing, and he crafted this film for diehard batman fans, succeeding immensely. can't wait to see more of this universe.",high
7996,"_the batman_ is the best live-action batman movie yet. it's the type of batman film i've been waiting for my whole life.

it's dark and realistic, but also stylish and large-scale. it's not limited by a commitment to realism like the dark knight trilogy, nor is it burdened by a shared universe like the dceu. it is its own thing. a moody, disturbing, visually stunning, david fincher-inspired, three hour long detective epic with some of the best interpretations of the characters ever put on screen.

robert pattinson is fantastic as a younger, moodier, and yes, more emo batman. paul dano is straight up terrifying as the riddler. colin farrell is unrecognisable in more ways than one as the penguin and zoë kravitz is easily my favorite live-action catwoman. massively underrated is john turturro as carmine falcone.

this movie kept me hooked all the way through. it's almost three hours long but it feels like two.

this is the best batman movie. the dark knight is good and all, but reeves finds the perfect mix of gritty realism and style (nolan would never even dare to have a snorricam shot of batmam gliding over the city), and finally gives us a live-action batman that lives up to the title of ""world's greatest detective"". not that there's much competition, since he's like the only one to actually do any detective work (no, christian bale magically finding a fingerprint on a broken bullet doesn't count).",high

7999,"to be honest, this is a really good movie. hang on? so why did i only give it 2 out of 5 stars? well, this is really personal but, to me, it is not a good batman movie. i really had problems writing this review because it is a very good movie. i just did not like it as a batman movie.

the movie is really dark, gritty and noir. not really a problem. it works for some movies. but it is also quite slow at the beginning and the first quarter of the movie was actually boring. remember, this is a three hour movie so a quarter is more than half an hour of “boringness”.

the “boringess” was broken up by a pretty cool car chase. some people seem to not really like the batmobile and i have to say that it was not very inspired but it was not all bad either. unfortunately the movie turned rather boring for a while again after that.

the movie tries to bring out more of the detective part of batman than the previous movies, which is fine, but there is just too much moping around with batman / bruce wayne walking around oozing sadness all around him.

actually, this brings us to my main gripe with this movie. the choice of actor for the batman is just wrong for me. he is more like a sad puppy than the batman. the script that makes him mope around, have emotional outbreaks and, occasionally, being downright stupid like just staring dumbfounded when explosives go off in his face does not really help of course.

to me the selina kyle character had more charisma than the batman, especially when the batman was in his bruce wayne alter ego.

and i really, really dislike that twist about bruce’s parents. that was such a lazy hollywood writer hack thing to do just to create (unwanted) drama.

then we have the riddler. compared to the charismatic villains that we have come to expect he is just a sad little psychopath with a bunch of equally sad fanatical internet followers.

now, all of this would have worked great if it had been a movie about some, unspecified, vigilante. the movie is really well done. the detective story, the action (especially towards the end) and the noir setting would have worked great. even at its three hour bloated length it would have been great although cut down to two hours or a bit more would have been even better. if it had not been a batman movie!",low

secondly, there were other small things that sucked about this movie, for example, cat woman had a very simple and stupid mask. even older movie versions had a better mask than here. batman's batmobile also sucked. looked like a downgraded version. he also rode just a simple bike and lastly, he couldn't even glide with his default batman suit. also, don't know why but james gordon was played by a black actor, while in every movie and even in every game this character is white. riddler character also seemed stupid, wearing stupid mask and acting stupid and wasn't intimidating at all, but laughable. so, in general cast and acting was disappointing in this movie.

lastly, the movie itself... it was dull, boring and depressive. they tried to make it masterpiece with 3 hours long, but in reality movie became just plain boring and i almost fell asleep. 

overall verdict: disappointing.",low
8013,"the only way for this movie to wow you is to give it some respect. ultimately, this movie is not for everyone and that's okay.

simply, skinamarink is a mood piece. most people come into the horror genre to mock the stupid decisions of the characters, gawk at the intense gore, or to be thrilled in a safe environment. this movie, however, will leave those viewers with nothing. this movie is for the viewers who want to be enveloped by the liminal mood. it sends them back to their childhood, when they were afraid to walk around their house at night. it sent me back to when i would sneak downstairs to try to watch some cartoons and eat cereal, leaving the house dark and quiet so i don't wake anyone else up.

most of this film is a blank screen with vhs-like fuzz that tricks your mind into seeing things that aren't there. the cinematography is brilliant in the way that it always shows you just enough that you want to peek around the corner, but you also don't want to. the amount of interpretations of this very simple movie speaks to its density. the symbolism and ambiguity let the mind run wild with theories and explanations.

if i were to change one thing, then i would make the movie at least a half hour shorter. it would be way more approachable if it were more like ""the backrooms"" by kane pixels on youtube. however, i also feel like the length is necessary to fully set the viewer in the mindset to fully enjoy the second half of the film. thankfully, there is no producer to get in the way of kyle edward ball's genius film making.

i suggest watching this movie at night with no external noise and no distractions, sitting on the floor of your living room to get the full experience. give it the respect it deserves. and if you can't get into the mood they expect, then you might as well turn off the tv and watch the empty screen for two hours.",high

the last wish deals with some pretty heavy themes for an animated children's movie. death is something that all humans will have to face which was handled in such a nuanced and mature way here. from panic attacks to haunting imagery, death looms large throughout the entire film and serves as a menacing villain. the journey our heroes take to confront this fear is very heartwarming and will resonant with most audience members.

with most dreamworks pictures, the comedy is targeted at both children and adults. i did find myself laughing out loud at plenty of jokes, but just as many landed flat for me. this would be more of an issue, but this is an incredibly balanced film with great action and dramatic moments that leave little room for a few flat jokes to make a large impact on my experience.

the screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. and it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.

8044,"i have to confess that i went into watching this movie with quite some negative bias following woke disney’s dismissal of johnny depp. not that i am such a great fan of depp but it was just wrong. woke disney’s asshats have been trying to get rid of him since the first pirates movie so they used a bullshit excuse to get rid of him.

then already in the first couple of scenes woke disney goes full woke to cater for a very small but loudmouthed minority. totally unnecessary since the vast majority do not care and a lot of said majority are simply fed up by having woke shit crammed into the movies for no justifiable reason whatsoever.

so, for me, this movie did get off to a poor start indeed.

unfortunately the rest of the movie had literally nothing in it to remedy this bad start except for a bunch of special effects. i really do not understand what woke disney thought when the put this franchise killer together.

the first movie, fantastic beasts and where to find them, in the franchise was a great movie. it was colorful, it was family oriented and it was filled with magic and fantastic beasts. it was fun, it was humorous and it had a bit of adventure in it.

this movie is nothing like that. why they call it fantastic beasts i do not understand. they should call it boring political drama in the potter universe instead.

it is dark, grey and, mostly, boring. it is not really a family movie. a lot of the time not much is happening except people walking, standing or sitting and looking gloomy. there are some outbursts of magic action and these are really the only enjoyable scenes in the movie thanks to the special effects.

they even managed to drag the supposedly happy ending epilogue out to become frustratingly boring. amazing how disney, who has made so many enjoyable family movies, has transformed into woke disney spewing out one disaster after another.",low

8051,"i generally like michael bay movies, even when they go into stupid, inane territory. however, his latest, ambulance is a 90-100 minute movie that is stretched to over two hours and got tedious pretty quickly, most notably the aerial/drone shots that did make me a tad nauseous. the writing also was pretty poor including the cringe ""comedic"" lines that didn't work, not to mention a few unnecessary scenes for the supporting characters. i guess on the plus side jake gyllenhaal can play psychotic pretty well and yahya abdul-mateen ii has his moments. i also liked how bay/composer lorne balfe recycled one of the themes from 13 hours at the end.

8055,"this is a michael bay movie. i could probably stop the review here because that says all about the movie. lots of special effects and a mediocre story at best.

this michael bay movie is no different. the two stars i gave it is solely for the action and the special effects. the script is not even mediocre. it is rubbish.

i think what grated on me the most is that there are two characters in the whole movie that are somewhat likable. the rest are either assholes or idiots. mostly both.

the actions of almost everyone are just annoyingly stupid and illogical. the constant bickering and shouting is frustrating. this “criminal mastermind”, danny sharp, is alternating between being a psychopath and just an idiot. his idiot comment towards the end that they were not the bad guys, they were just trying to get home was so braindead it was unbelievable. the police force is not really any better.

the entire chase part is just so ridiculous most of the time and the constant shouting and arguing drags it down further. the idea of doing an operation, over the phone, during a high speed chase while taking 90 degree turns every two minutes or so is laughable.

then they had all this silly work up to where the baddies were going to assault the cops with their customized vehicles and the one time i expected michael bay to shine and even go a bit over the top it ended up being rather meh and mediocre.

normally i do not really care that much if the script is not top notch in these kind of movies as long as it is good enough to drive the action but this script was too ludicrous and devoid of intelligence even for me.",low

""morbius is yet another disaster from the sony-marvel shared universe.

despite good performances from jared leto and matt smith and even a couple of visually captivating action sequences, the formulaic screenplay that seems to originate from the beginning of the century ruins everything in its path.

from the predictability and zero creativity of the main plot to the heavy reliance on uninteresting, unnecessary exposition, daniel espinosa finds his most significant problem in the blatant lack of care in the treatment of the characters.

the narrative logical lapses are too many to ignore and even amplified by extremely messy editing, a third act wrapped in an unfathomable blend of cgi, and a plagiarized score.

one of the most embarrassing productions by a major studio in recent years.""

disaster movies always ask for suspension of disbelief, but roland emmerich really stretches the absurdity levels by co-writing one of the most scientifically ridiculous screenplays in the history of cinema - the third act revelations are genuinely jaw-dropping.

but, it as a bit much cgi (like everything else nowadays) and i think modern audiences are getting tired of paying out the wazoo to basically watch a video game.

and then the narration.  the voice is too young and though it does make sense with the plot, it is jarring because basic tradition is that narrations have an older and wiser voice... morgan freeman, spock, etc.  so that is going to instantly set the radiance off.

and then the snyderverse is over.  period.  they made no illusions about that, we have known it was over for years, there was even a massive backlash about his cut of justice league because it was given the fans what they wanted and thus bad... because politics and politics have declared that people that are enthusiastic about anything that isn't left wing politics are evil.

because the world has gone insane.

but the greater point is that people already don't care.  they not only already don't care, but they were sort of told not to by the very people that made the movie.  

it's world is over.  this world ended before it was released.

which, sucks, because shazam was my favorite to come out of the dceu.

people aren't going to care.  they aren't going to watch it and when they do it's going to come with disdain.

but as far as a superhero movie goes... come on, you're not really getting much.  they aren't chinatown, they are just popcorn munchers and nothing more, and that isn't bad.  but let's call it what it is.

unless they are political like the mcu, they are just mindless action and gags.  and if they are political like the mcu, they sort of stink.

with such a low budget, it's almost humiliating that so many expensive hollywood blockbusters can't even reach the heels of so much originality, imagination, excitement, and emotion. michelle yeoh leads the troops in a film that also pays homage to the iconic career of the actress who, at 59 years old, accompanies the fantastic stunt team in truly outlandish fights.

the mother-daughter relationship as the emotional core of the story follows a surprisingly predictable path and needs a few more dialogues to deliver an even more powerful climax, but it still induces tears and a genuine sense of concern for the characters.

8127,"**by: louisa moore / www.screenzealots.com**


writer / director ruben östlund‘s wickedly sharp black comedy “triangle of sadness” offers a biting satire of everything from gender roles, capitalist society, corruption of power, modern masculinity, and the social hierarchies that result from a system that encourages class division. the film has a lot to say and does it well, wading through layers of stinging dialogue, sophisticated observations, and lots and lots of vomit.

the film is a lot more than its now-infamous fifteen minute puking scene, however. it’s an in-your-face story that doesn’t shy away from confronting everything from the rampant abuse of the less privileged to the primitive savagery of human nature.

instagram influencers and celebrity model couple carl (harris dickinson) and yaya (charlbi dean) are invited on an all-expenses-paid vacation on a luxury cruise in exchange for expert promotion on social media. the ritzy yacht is frequented by ultra-rich passengers who demand the finest things in life (one of the early scenes features a helicopter air-dropping a couple of jars of nutella in the ocean, which is hilarious because it’s so ridiculous).

as carl and yaya settle in, they begin to meet their very wealthy fellow guests, including a couple of british arms dealers, a russian oligarch (zlatko buric), and an unhinged marxist boat captain (woody harrelson) who spends the majority of the cruise drunk and locked in his cabin. if not a recipe for disaster, it certainly sets the stage for an interesting few days at sea. but after the ship encounters a vicious storm and capsizes, the handful of survivors are left stranded on a deserted island and fighting for survival.

the film has a lot to say about feminism, sexism, today’s social-media obsessed society, the gross exploitation of the working class, the conflicts between the haves and have-nots, the shallowness of the fashion industry, and lots more.

while it would’ve been the easier route to demonize the billionaires in his story, östlund instead chooses to make them appropriately ostentatious yet still kind of likeable. they’re not entirely jackasses, they’re just mega-wealthy. setting the film on a cruise ship is brilliant too, as they have a built-in class system between passengers and amongst the crew. the boat symbolizes the hierarchy of social classes, including the officers, the predominantly white “face time” staff, and the lower rungs that include the cooks, engineers, janitorial workers, and other people of color. it’s satisfying to watch the pecking order not only completely dissolve but get turned upside down after the yacht sinks. that’s when the working class takes over, because they’re the ones who know how to get stuff done.

the film offers shrewd observations and a critique of class and privilege, culminating in a third act that delivers a bountiful amount of schadenfreude. the best is the story of “toilet worker” abigal (dolly de leon, who gives the film’s standout performance), a woman who quickly takes command on the deserted island because she is the only person with any sort of survival skills. after starting a fire, catching fish, and handling the distribution of the small amount of supplies left on the lifeboat, she demands that everyone refer to her as “captain.” she even begins trading food for sexual favors with carl.

östlund’s film about a cruise from hell is an achievement in satire that effortlessly skewers many timely subjects. he sets his eyes squarely on deserved targets and dismantles them with wit and sophistication, making “triangle of sadness” one of the smartest and most interesting films of the year.",high

""death on the nile retains the problems of its predecessor, containing an even less mysterious central mystery and even less interesting multiple storylines. kenneth branagh is the great savior, offering a distinctive directing style and an iconic performance as hercule poirot.

despite some good displays and a couple of pleasant arcs, michael green's screenplay relies too much on its heavy exposition, not managing to escape the forced, dull, redundant dialogues. the audiovisual environment surrounding the entire film reeks of digital deception, sweating its green screen throughout the runtime.

a whodunnit is worth more than merely finding the criminal, but the resolution literally being the first option that the first act suggests leaves an inevitable taste of disappointment.""

rating: c-",low
8139,"i honestly did not expect much out of this movie given how branagh’s murder on the orient express turned out.

now, hercule poirot together with sherlock holmes are my two favourite fictional detectives and i’m obviously having strong opinions about the subject. if you liked the movie then fine but this is my personal opinions so… here we go.

just as with murder on the orient express it could have been a decent mystery/crime movie if it had not pretended to be a hercule poirot movie but again this was a miserable attempt to make a americanized version of hercule poirot.

the movie starts off with black and white scenes from world war i trying to make him out to be some war hero. there was no reason for that and it is not hercule poirot.

one good thing i can write about the movie is that there are some lovely scenery, especially at the beginning. unfortunately that is about it as far as the good parts go from my point of view.

apart from the good scenery the film goes overboard trying to get fancy with the camera. like the ridiculous revolving scenes on the boat, bizarre perspectives and quite a few too dark and gloomy scenes.

the worst part of the movie is that it is totally disrespectful of the hercule poirot that agatha christie created. poirot does not run after criminals while shots are being fired, poirot may scream but with dignity, not soap opera like outbursts. he was not the only one having unbecoming outbursts by the way. and do not get me started about how the movie ruined the famous end scene where poirot traditionally exposes the criminal by having poirot waving a gun and appearing totally dishevelled. even the hideously large moustache is just all wrong.

death on the nile is a british mystery novel by one of the most famous mystery writers ever, not some pulp fiction that you can put your own spin on but kenneth branagh does not seem to realize this.",low
8141,"death on the nile has a prologue set in world war i, where a young hercule poirot is played by a digitally ‘de-aged’ kenneth branagh. et tu, kenneth? if you must do this, why not get a younger actor who looks likes branagh? or even one who doesn’t look like the northern irish writer/director/actor, so long as he looks like an actual human being; it’s safe to say that branagh looks neither like himself nor like a member of the human race (he actually looks less grotesque after an explosion disfigures one side of his face). again, this is only if you must do this – but then, you mustn’t do it, especially considering that this prologue exists only, and i kid you not, as an origin story for poirot’s mustache.

in order to catch up with branagh’s current appearance, the character then ages some 40 years in the space of about two decades, and in the interim it’s the world around him that has received a digital facelift – in particular egypt, whose entire topography and everything in it, including flora, fauna, bodies of water, architecture, historical landmarks, etc., etc., has been computer-generated, and very crudely at that. they should have called this death on denial, because based on the evidence of this movie, the nile isn’t a river in egypt – or a river at all, nor egypt a place that bears any resemblance to any known landscape that can be found on planet earth.

as for the actual plot, who cares? it's impossible to believe in the existence of these characters as real persons because they're all clearly actors standing in front of green screens, and the ""death"" of the title is rendered meaningless because it takes place in a lifeless world. even an agatha christie murder mystery – nay, especially an agatha christie murder mystery demands a plausible backdrop, and in that sense a matte painting, rear projection, miniatures, any number indeed of practical special effects would offer a much more tangible setting for this story – the next best thing, as a matter of fact, to actually shooting on location (which admittedly is not always feasible).",low

the story is convoluted to say the least and there is as much logic in it as you would expect from a hollywood writer hack. things more or less just happen and the “heroes” fight off one dinosaur attack after another on their way to the bad gay without ever tiring. and why the hell can hollywood never produce a movie where the “heroes” doesn’t just stare like idiots at something until they are screwed?

idiotic nonsens like being able to train a dinosaur to home in on someone like a heat seeking missile and chase them forever after having pointed a laser marker on them for a couple of seconds is also the usual unintelligent hollywood nonsense that just ruins a movie for anyone with anything like average intelligence.

8186,"the cinemark near me has started to show indian movies. not feeling like sitting home tonight, i decided to catch this one, and luck was with me.

my image of indian movies, i confess, was that they were mostly musicals centering around a love story involving a very beautiful young woman and a very handsome young man, with lots of elaborate, high-energy dance numbers to keep things going.

there is a love story here, but it's not the focus of the film. there are also a few large and very impressive dance numbers, but only a few. (the men's dancing, extremely athletic, astounded me.)

rather, this movie focuses on the story of two young men in 1920s india who, each in his own way, are fighting against the english occupiers.

the english are portrayed as inhuman monsters. very often, they made me think of the worst atrocities committed by the germans in france during world war ii, or the most rabid racists in the american south. the first time we see the two male leads dancing, a link is indeed made between the indians and what appear to be black american musicians.

every time the indians manage to take revenge on the english for their inhuman abuse of the indians, you cheer - but at times i wondered if i would have cheered watching a parallel movie about blacks taking revenge on white racists who had mistreated them in the american south, especially if i had been in a movie theater where, like tonight, i was the only audience member who did not belong to the oppressed population. imagine spike lee, for example, able to make a movie in which he did not have to worry about selling tickets to whites as well as blacks, and you have some idea of how anti-british colonials this movie is. it is the difference between a society in which the oppressor was a small minority of the population vs. here, where blacks are a minority of the american population. i don't want to push this comparison too far. the movie only makes the connection in one scene. but this is very definitely a movie that focuses on the story of a brutally oppressed people seeking freedom from an inhuman oppressor, rather than just a series of dance numbers.

i don't speak any of the indian languages used in the movie, but i had no problem following what was going on with the subtitles, which were almost always easy to read. i'm sure there were cultural references i didn't catch, however, especially at the end in the final big dance number, which seemed to be presenting india as a nation of different regions and cultures all united in one.

the director and cinematographer definitely deserve praise. there was one very striking visual image after the next, especially during the battle scenes. ram charan, dressed as a ""native warrior""-if that term means anything anymore-flying through flames was breathtaking.

so, if you've even been curious about indian movies, give this one a try. yes, it's three hours long, but trust me, the time goes flying by. this is truly an action movie, a mixture of visual fantasy and often very graphic realism that held my interest to the end.",high

“rrr” is one of those movies where just about everyone who watches it, loves it. it’s an over-the-top historical spectacle about a violent uprising in 1920s india, offering a fictitious retelling of real events. this international blockbuster has everything: thrilling action sequences, adrenaline-charged stunts, a rousing story, and euphoric bollywood dance scenes that are nothing short of show-stopping.

the plot centers around two real-life india revolutionaries, alluri sitarama raju (ram charan teja) and komaram bheem (n.t. rama rao jr.), and imagines what would have happened had the two met and become friends. in “rrr,” the men join together to fight against the british raj and brutal colonialism in order to save the people. the trail of vengeance begins after a young girl is abducted and bheem takes action to free her from the tyrannical regime. raju is working for the enemy and becomes a strong adversary to bheem’s rescue mission. clashes and chaos ensue when the two start working together.

this movie is crazy, ridiculous, silly, excessive, and absolutely amazing. director s.s. rajamouli has an enviable skill and master of the craft, as he puts together some truly inventive and unforgettable sequences. everything is executed with precision and it all works, no matter how outrageous the ideas sound (like unleashing an army of cgi animals into an unsuspecting crowd). this is a strong achievement in directing, and it’s one of the most entertaining movies i have ever seen.

part of the reason the film works so well is due to the two charismatic leads who can act, dance, sing, and do their own stunts. they’re bonafide action stars with old hollywood charisma and charm, and their screen presence is unmatched. i could happily watch these two in anything. they’re so good together that audiences should be begging for a sequel.

it’s not all lighthearted fun, and rajamouli takes his historical setting seriously. the film doesn’t gloss over brutality and violence, and there are upsetting scenes of abuse and death. men, women, and children are put in great peril. the heroes in the movie are mostly men, and women are the ones who need to be rescued. this is a macho story and not a feminist one, but that doesn’t make much of a difference to the classic action movie vibe.

everything is dialed up to the maximum level, and every second of the movie’s 3-hour-plus run time is packed. “rrr” is a crowd-pleasing cinematic experience that’s intoxicating, exhilarating, and delivers a ton of fun. it may also inspire viewers to research india’s history and learn more about the country’s revolutionaries, which is an interesting undertaking in its own right.",high
8189,"this movie is one, really fun, action-packed, superhero watch. the cgi, of course, is fantastic. what i love about this movie, though, is that it's not just an empty, trivial story as an excuse for cgi. quite the contrary. the story itself is a fictionalized version of a very real, revolutionary period just before gandhi's non-violence movement took the lead.

if anyone could make any complaint at all, it would be that the british roles are caricatures. honestly though, what do we white americans know of how imperial britain treated its ""non-white subjects""? we do know that, in 1919, british troops fired on a crowd of unarmed protesters killing hundreds of men, women and children. so the film is steeped in real history. perhaps, the caricatures were rajamouli's way of side-stepping the issue by allowing the viewer to accept them at the same level of unreality as the two super heroes of the film.

the film itself is over the top, fun and action-packed. it even has the requisite bollywood dance scenes! i loved the way ram became rama, the mythological hindu archer, an avatar of vishnu. i probably missed other cultural references, but i suspect that when the two superheroes cooperate, they have 4 arms - that is shiva, the destroyer with a bow and arrow in two of the arms. the story and production design are gripping. s.s. rajamouli does such an amazing job with the pacing that three hours seems to fly by before you can even say popcorn.",high

nighy is wonderful and methodical (in a good way) as a man who is thawing out from a repetitious, paralyzed life after he receives life-altering news. he even impresses when he sings a song in the same quiet, restrained manner.

8214,"i want to first state that i am absolutely thrilled about how wokely pro-racism this, i mean it's 2022, the worst year in cinematic history, but i didn't think the woke corporate overlords would go to this racist extreme.  this is some repugnant crap and if i didn't know better, i would think that they were trying to go full blazing saddles and spoof racism.... but alas, it is disney, and disney is woke, the racism here isn't satirizing the subject, it's embracing it in all it's evil glory.

let's start with how they castrated namor and then move on to utterly and completely they stereotyped latinos, right down to focusing on how wet his back is and beating him by drying off his wet back.

as if that wasn't racist enough it goes on to make it's prideful support of black nationalism clearly stated, the opposite of which we call white nationalism, which is very much the purview of groups like the neo-nazis, kkk, and other hate groups.  wakanda forever has done an excellent job of embracing that same ideology for the black people of the world... and claiming it as a sort of pride.

and that, of course, is exemplified by their virtuous victory over the forces of... latino, who are so overtly masculine, right down to their shameful gendered language (like about 90% of the other languages on the globe) that they had to edit out namor's bulge in order to... what... show more african racial superiority over the latino population, or maybe just to add corporate feminism to the black nationalist message.

either way, the statement they made here was clear, latinos bad, black nationalism good...

... god i can't wait until racism is something that is shunned across the board again, because the people who like this crap deserve all the respect we give to the people that loved the original birth of a nation and rode around the south wearing sheets on their heads.

i expected a healthy dose of black nationalism when i walked in, i even expected the in your face male-hating... but i thought the racism was going to be directed at people like me, you know, white people.  instead the racism was directed at latinos and, for some reason, that seems even more repugnant given the hypocrisy that comes with it.",low

the movie is a cgi special effects feast of course. that is really one of the main reasons to watch this movie. however, benedict cumberbatch is really great as doctor strange as well.

the movie has a half decent story. as good as you could expect from a marvel movie. as usual it is a mix of action, suspense and comedy relief and marvel has actually managed to get a decent balance in this movie. doctor strange stays competent throughout the movie and although wong is sometimes a bit silly it is not too bad. there is little of the unintelligent slapstick “comedy” that marvel sometimes pollute their movies with.

i have to say that the main bad guy, wanda the scarlet witch, was a bit mediocre though. sure, when she let loose with her magic it was generally cool but, to me, she lacked real bad guy charisma.

at times the movie became a rather violent actually. although there was no real gore in it, the way wanda disposed of some of the heroes in the alternate universe was somewhat brutal. also the alternate universe undead doctor strange was almost horror movie material.

and it is about wanda, who did horrible things and was instantly forgiven because girl power... or something... or woke or whatever.

no, i didn't watch this because i didn't want another lecture and i didn't want to support another lecture.

pro-tip hollywood, if you want to make movies that people pay to see, don't make movies that people are going to take one look at and think: ""this is going to scream at me about how evil i am nonstop,"" and then scream at them nonstop for not watching it.

8255,"> **jim jones; executive chef**

going to a once-in-a-lifetime tasting at a restaurant headed by one of (if not _the_) most renowned chefs in the world sounds like a dream come true to any foodie. (myself included, albeit vicariously via the food network) two of these lucky guests are tyler (played by **nicholas hoult**), and margot (played by **anya taylor-joy**).

the issue is, something is already not right.  no, it's not obvious; at least not to normal people like you and me. elsa (played by **hong chau**) picked up on it, but she isn't like us.  as more and more guest arrive, someone isn't supposed to be there... ah, don't worry, the feeling will pass.  after all, the tasting is just about to start...

this is when we meet the executive chef, chef slowik (brilliantly played by **ralph fiennes**).  at first he is charismatic and prepares his guest for each tasting with stories. but this little cult like bigrade eventually let on that they know more about their guests than anyone should... that is except for one. 

as someone who is enamored with the food world, seeing the menu satire some of my favorite shows:

* netflix's chef's table with the course spotlight cinematography and ingredients cards.
* any celebrity chef (i.e. chef slowik calling someone a 'donkey', clearly a reference to gordon ramsey).  

...i was delighted that this film leaned into the dark end of how service work can feel sometimes.  this film feels cathartic having lived the life of a service worker, and i feel others who have had that experience should be able to connect to the darker parts of the film as well. 

the plot culminate in a theme that i think despite what mild morbidity was displayed, most watchers can relate; be it society's expectations or our own, the more we push toward perceived greatness we run away from that childhood excitement that set up on the path to begin with. 

the menu as a whole, is, well... something you might hear at an actual tasting: a story of life, it's memories (good and bad) told in 5 courses.  if you're part of the menu, you deserve to stay until the end... that is, unless your not supposed to be here; perhaps life hasn't beaten you down enough yet... in-any-case, there is always the _cool aid_.",high
8257,"this was my actual last straw with imdb... i guess you have to like this one or else.  and by that i mean they are purging all the bad reviews.

from the start you know what is going to happen, because it's basically the same thing that always happens on ominous deserted islands... and the ""they eat the diners"" thing was removed because one of the couples were regular diners there.

one example (and this _is_ a spoiler, albeit a small one, so skip this paragraph if you still want to watch the movie) is when one character gets his finger chopped off. this was because he told his wife he was going to 'handle' the situation, and one of the baddies responded by asking 'with which hand?' when he didn't reply, she said 'left hand, ring finger' and one of the other baddies proceeded to chop said finger off.

now that all sounds very clever (handle/hand - what a pun!) if you don't think about it too much, but if you _do_, you'll realize that the baddies had no way of knowing that that character was going to use the word 'handle', and yet removing his finger seemed to have been pre-planned. were they going to do it anyway, and his use of the word was a lucky coincidence that allowed them to make a pun while doing it? or in their meeting earlier, did they say ""at some point someone might use the word 'handle', at which point we're going to remove part of their hand""? i don't know, and some of you might say i'm being pedantic, but this movie was _full_ of things like this. it really took me out of it. 3/10, wouldn't recommend.",low

ben affleck and michael keaton look like they’re having fun, but ezra miller is obnoxious as the focal point of the film. there’s no sincerity in his performance even when it seems like he’s being genuine. _the flash_ is a superhero film that prioritizes silliness with a cheese factor of gargantuan proportions, but no actual entertainment values whatsoever.

the movie is perfect for movie lovers who are looking for an exciting and suspenseful experience. the film features a talented ensemble cast led by ezra miller, sasha kali, michael keaton and michael shannon, which enhance the power of the performance and draw the viewers in with their outstanding performances.

""the flash"" enjoys a large budget and wide public appreciation, with a cost of $ 190 million, and revenues of $ 267 million, 481 thousand and 43 dollars. this reflects the success of the film and its positive impact on the audience.

8270,"i fear i may be turning into some sort of dc fanboy because... i thought this was great.

like with <em>'shazam! fury of the gods'</em>, i was not expecting much from these dceu films as i only decided to watch them so i could catch up on this universe before the <em>'aquaman and the lost kingdom'</em> finale next month. i guess i was subconsciously anticipating these to be as flat as a pancake due to the suits upstairs focusing on the upcoming dcu. yet, i've had a terrific time thus far - <em>'blue beetle'</em> pending.

as for this film itself, i'm not someone who has any interest in comic books so my only knowledge comes directly from the films. all i knew beforehand was the rather dodgy life of ezra miller (just look at their wikipedia!) apparently affecting production. that's a lot of words to simply say that i have no clue how well of an adaptation this is from the comics, though simply as a film it give me entertainment, it really did.

<em>'the flash'</em> features a strong performance from miller, who portrays the aforementioned with quality throughout. i don't remember barry allen from the other dceu flicks, so i'm pleased to have something memorable from the character with this. elsewhere, sasha calle is very good as supergirl, while michael keaton is much fun as batman. there are some solid cameos in there too.

i will say that i personally would've shaved some of the run time, it does overrun ever so slighty. that is my only proper criticism though, given everything else from the story - which brings heart - to the special effects to whatever is done to a positive standard. rating-wise, i've gone back and forth between 8/10 and 9/10 - it narrowly nabs the latter.",high

big fan of the special effects throughout, the whole look of film in general is pleasant and i like how bright it all is for the vast majority; as opposed to the dreary darkness that superhero flicks seemingly tend to bring, especially in the dceu. the score is excellent, not necessarily one i'd add to my movie soundtrack playlist but with the context of what's onscreen it's great.

the cast bring noteworthy performances. i wouldn't actually put anyone as a true standout, naturally zachary levi sticks out most but as a bunch of characters i had an enjoyable time watching them all in truth. it's fun seeing helen mirren and lucy liu in their respective roles, while rachel zegler is a positive addition and djimon hounsou is pleasing. jack dylan grazer spearheads the rest of them well.

the only real criticism i have is a couple of bits of dialogue, namely the product placement ones... that certain sweet brand and its slogan in particular. otherwise, i can only say i found a lot of enjoyment with <em>'shazam! fury of the gods'</em>... my favourite flick from this universe, though a quick glance at the average rating suggests i should whisper that quietly!",high

one of the standout aspects of john wick 4 is the villains. this time around, they are more interesting than ever, with big-name actors bringing their a-game to their respective roles. it's always great to see veteran actors like keanu reeves and laurence fishburne on screen, but the addition of newcomers like bill skarsgard and donnie yen really elevates the movie.

but perhaps the real star of john wick 4 is the fight cinematography. the one-take fight scene that was filmed from overhead is a work of art. it's so seamless and fluid that you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action. the attention to detail in every fight scene is astounding, with each punch and kick feeling like it has real weight behind it.

one slight negative of the movie is that john wick doesn't have much development. however, this is a minor quibble, as the movie is so focused on delivering incredible action that the lack of character development doesn't really matter. after all, john wick is at his best when he's kicking ass, and he certainly does that in spades in this movie.

overall, john wick 4 is a fantastic entry in the series. the sense of finality that permeates throughout the movie is perfect, and it really feels like a fitting end to the story. if you're a fan of action movies, then john wick 4 is an absolute must-see. it's a thrilling ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.

it's been a strange year for franchise filmmaking so far. while the very consistent dissatisfaction towards the mediocre mcu got even worse with the release of **ant-man and the wasp: quantumania** with that film being just flat-out boring and exhausting with the only saving grace being kang, **shazam: fury of the gods** being another one of dceu projects which will soon cease to exist and **scream vi** surprising literally everyone at being actually pretty fucking good even though it is the 6th film in a franchise following a near-dead sub-genre of slasher films, it has been quite a lot of misses for the franchises with only a few making above the cut. therein comes along **john wick: chapter 4**, a film already set on an insane trajectory, wherein everyone’s favourite bruised protagonist has gotten to a supposedly even deeper tenth circle of hell when he tried to climb out of the ninth circle in the previous film.

i was a bit, just a teeny little bit disappointed by the previous film i.e. parabellum but, after seeing this film; it is in 100 years, the one thing that all film critics are going to agree on is that john wick: chapter 4 truly was peak cinema. let’s just put all our cards on the (high) table. yes, john wick: chapter 4 is 169 minutes long. any one of its many (many) set pieces contains more action all by itself than most entire movies. this thing ain’t just a chapter. it’s a whole damn book; a glorious, nightmarish, biblical compendium which contains all manners of _**ass-kickery**_ and _**gun-fu**_. i’m just gonna come out and say it. this is the best cinematic experience i’ve had in a theatre for an action film in the last decade. this film absolutely floored me. performances? **peak**. cinematography? **double peak**. action set pieces? **triple peak**. ending? **goated fr**.

first of all, performances. if you told me 10 years ago that the matrix films are going to remain as keanu’s most consistent and better performances, i would’ve totally agreed with you. cut to present day, my opinion is going to differ from yours. john wick is officially the best and most consistent piece of his performances and this film makes that certain. keanu is mostly silent in this film but then also you can feel everything his character is feeling at a certain moment which makes his performance all the more marvelous. he doesn’t have much dialogues in this film, probably like 15-20 lines in this film but each line is delivered in a way that john wick (if he existed in real life) would say it. ian mcshane also gives quite a performance here. amplifying winston’s place as john’s father figure, he is what i would call, essentially the heart and soul of this film. laurence fishburne, although appears very briefly, does a good job and it’s always nice to see neo and morpheus just strolling around and talking. and ofcourse, i’m never going to get tired of seeing hiroyuki sanada in a film. he comes in, murders people left and right like a badass, and leaves like a king. the standouts to me though, are **donnie yen**, **bill skarsgård** and **shamier anderson**. all of these have never been introduced to the audience before this film and now that they have been, they completely steal the show. donnie yen essentially plays the chinese version of daredevil who isn’t a lawyer but a hitman and doesn’t think twice before a kill. loved him in the film and the ways chad stahelski (the director) uses his blindness throughout the film to show us some really interesting kills. bill skarsgård rises up as this franchise’s most menacing antagonist to date who will stop at nothing to get the job done. he plays a french billionaire and my god his accent is just the sexiest. the pronunciation of certain words in the french accent and his control over the table’s resources literally turned the city of love into the city of merciless bloodshed. shamier anderson essentially plays what john wick would’ve been in the younger days. a hitman who works for the highest payday and carries around an emotional support dog who does everything but.

now, the cinematography. this film was a visual spectacle. everything, and i mean everything looks perfect. there isn’t a single shot in this film that feels dimly lit or out of tone. the work on display is truly fantastic here and i was just amazed at seeing the various color palettes this film uses. this film manages to be the darkest john wick film without sacrificing visual clarity. every frame is lit up with just the perfect amount of colours suitable for setting the mood of the scene and when that transcends into a bloody action scene, the environment does nothing but enhance the hacking and slashing. i would be surprised if the academy doesn’t nominate this film for best production design or best cinematography because _**this is art mr. white!**_ (who am i kidding, this film is just going to get ignored because it’s a huge summer blockbuster).

where do i even begin with the action in this film. i was a bit worried as to how are they going to show me anything new after i’ve seen literally every possible fight scenario from the previous three films. i was so wrong. there isn’t much new substance here persay but the action here is so well-defined, so well-choreographed, so meticulously detailed, that you just forget that you’ve seen something like this before; and that is what great action films are supposed to do. make you completely get immersed in the action and john wick chapter 4 doesn’t skip a beat.

the ending. ughhhhhhh. the ending for this film might just be a masterpiece. i am not gonna spoil it for you but trust me, when you see that ending sequence begin, you will be experiencing the greatest moments of cinematic history being unfolded. it isn’t a huge cgi bombastic action set-piece, instead, it subverts your expectations and becomes something completely different yet something very familiar. a perfect end to a perfect film.

go watch this film, you will not be disappointed.",high

8328,"a fun one!

i had a terrific time watching <em>'ant-man and the wasp: quantumania'</em>, despite hearing 'meh' things about it here and there online. it surpassed my expectations, to be honest. great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the mcu for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.

star of the show in my opinion is michelle pfeiffer. i don't recall her standing out in <em>'ant-man and the wasp'</em>, but here she's excellent from beginning to end. elsewhere, jonathan majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. paul rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of michael douglas and kathryn newton are positives too.

love the quantum realm setting. i'm nothing like an mcu nut, i'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the enviroment to the creatures; shoutout veb. like pfeiffer, corey stoll didn't really register on my radar in prior films, but him as m.o.d.o.k. is a lot of fun.

looking at my personal mcu ranking, this goes in at no. 8 - i didn't anticipate that! a literal quick glance at the average rating on here suggests i'm in the minority but i truly found much enjoyment from this. quite the improvement on ant-man 2, which is at the bottom of my aforementioned ranking.",high
8329,worst movie. even that much money - too much btw - for special effects cant hide reed's lacking effort to build a believable world. it's a poor and passionless visual copy of something like star wars mini... with minimal humor and zero originality. rip marvel.,low
8330,"when it comes to their marvel properties, there’s this slightly morbid insistence by disney to tie every teeny tiny detail of previous movies, television shows, and character arcs together in obsessive fashion. it’s becoming such an uncontrollable urge by the studio to engage in this behavior that the cause-and-effect is resulting in disasters like “eternals,” “thor: love and thunder,” and now, “ant-man and the wasp: quantumania.”

trying too hard to force a non-story into the already lame ant-man mythology, the film reunites superhero partners scott lang (paul rudd) and hope van dyne (evangeline lilly) as ant-man and the wasp. the pair find themselves thrust into the dangerous quantum realm along with hope’s parents hank pym (michael douglas) and janet van dyne (michelle pfeiffer), along with scott’s teenage daughter, cassie (kathryn newton). as they explore the unusual terrain and alien society filled with strange creatures, janet reveals that she didn’t quite tell the group everything about the three decades she spent trapped in the realm. facing new dangers from supervillan kang the conquerer (jonathan majors), the family must unite to stop a worldwide disaster.

very little about this project feels like a satisfying superhero movie and instead, it’s more like an assemblage of other (and far better) science fiction films. if not for the titanic budget and big-name stars, it could almost be mistaken for a redbox “mockbuster” of “star wars,” “mad max,” “avatar,” and “godzilla” combined.

the film takes place extensively in the quantum realm, which provides an unsightly setting of muted, dark brown, washed-out visuals. it’s an ugly place, so who why would audiences want to spend time there? the realm is a melting pot of exotic creatures and peculiar inhabitants that appear to have waltzed right out of the mos eisley cantina on tatooine. they’re cool to look at i guess, but was the point to make the film more appealing to children, or was it disney’s way of appeasing the animators by letting them have some fun?

the first third of the film seems like it’s janet’s show, as she keeps bringing up the fact that she has all these secrets that she won’t spill to hope and hank (even though they’re all stuck in the realm together). there’s no compelling mystery nor reveal. screenwriter jeff loveness is grasping at straws to craft a somewhat cohesive story while also struggling to make it fit into the mcu mythology. at some point, i wish someone would just make a damn standalone marvel superhero movie and quit worrying about who and what goes where and how.

the story is frequently erratic. there’s plenty of energetic cgi action, but there also some moments that play like a touching family drama, some that create an anti-climatic post-apocalyptic narrative, and lots of failed attempts at comic relief. the film also has recurring (and awkward) socially conscious messaging that doesn’t entirely feel out of place, but it is aggressive (there’s even a direct mention of socialism by one of the characters, which will really aggravate already-angry conservatives).

the screenplay is peppered with dreadful one-liners like “it’s never too late to stop being a dick!” and “ants don’t give up!” i really, really wish i was joking about this.

the remainder of the movie features a lot of talk about time, the desire to get home, and — marvel fans, you know what’s coming — the multiverse! it’s that one little word that means endless movies, endless stories, and endless money. it’s also the easy way to guarantee that all of these films in the canon always have a cop-out to lazily excuse away any inconsistencies (not that many of us could keep up or remember anyway).

another major problem with the film is that it can only chug along on rudd’s likeability (and the cast’s talent) for so long. it’s barely tolerable until kang shows up, but he’s a wickedly delicious character portrayed by a terrific actor (it’s a real shame that this had to be the film for majors’ mcu debut). in fact, the entire cast deserves better. despite all of them turning in strong performances, they still feel mostly wasted here.

“ant-man and the wasp: quantumania” lacks the memorable spectacle that most superhero films need in order to succeed. there’s no massively rousing, crowd-pleasing moment, and it’s one of the more unremarkable entries in the mcu.

8334,"while creed iii may not be the best in the franchise, it brings enough creativity and passion to the table to keep the series fresh.

the rocky/creed franchise is at its best when the villain is just as, if not more, interesting than our protagonist, and that is not more evident than in creed iii. damien anderson (expertly played by jonathan majors) is a very sympathetic antagonist that has a direct connection with adonis creed’s past. this connection is at the forefront of the conflict as creed tries to reconcile with his past mistakes while also being true to his present self. this back and forth is excellently done and evolves creed further as a boxer and a man. i really enjoyed this story overall, and while it may not be the most unique script to hit the silver screen, it does enough to differentiate itself from the rest of the rocky universe, and i can respect that.

the acting in this film is excellent, as it has been in previous creed films. i thought that there might be a hole left by the absence of sylvester stallone, but i really did not notice it at all. michael b. jordan is able to get the best out of the entire cast, and everyone is better than ever. tessa thompson is fantastic; her chemistry with jordan is incredible. the addition of their daughter creates a very wholesome family dynamic. jonathan majors is superb; he is intimidating, tragic, and full of emotion that the audience can genuinely resonate with. his anger is justified, and his portrayal of this angry kid who had his life taken from him is incredibly genuine. he was one of the best parts of the film.

with michael b. jordan behind the camera, this film has the most unique cinematography in the entire series. jordan takes some liberties with the material that came before to deliver a modern spin on the boxing genre. where previous films tried to have a broadcast experience grounded in grit and realism, creed iii turns that on its head, delivering the most stunning action scenes i have ever seen. the anime inspiration is apparent, with slow motion used sparingly but effectively. the finale fight has some very creative choices that create an intimate connection between our two leads that is a great backdrop to not only the fight but the story as a whole.

overall, i had an excellent time watching creed iii. michael b. jordan had a wonderful directorial debut, creating a film that left me with a huge smile on my face.

8343,"if not for a trademark over-the-top nicolas cage performance and a truly inspired fight scene in an apartment complex, “renfield” would be a total disaster of a movie. it’s certainly not any good and i wouldn’t recommend it to anyone, and the real horror of it all is the way director chris mckay blows what should have been a slam-dunk premise.

set in present day, renfield (nicholas hoult) is the tortured, loyal assistant to dracula (cage). he’s served his master for decades, taking care of everything from getting his cape dry cleaned to procuring fresh prey for dinner. after centuries of servitude, renfield is finally ready to move on and create a life of his own.

although it is mostly dead in the water, the film’s pacing never feels slow. there’s plenty of entertainment, it’s just not fun enough, outrageous enough, nor twisted enough. the tone is both tongue-in-cheek and sincere, which is not cohesive as a whole. there’s a lot of action that means nothing, and characters like awkwafina‘s police officer that are bland and forgettable.

the side plots about a crime family with a ruthless boss (shohreh aghdashloo) and her son (ben schwartz) that wants renfield dead is half-baked, and the funny group therapy bits where dracula’s assistant seeks help for co-dependency and dealing with his raging narcissist of a boss falls flat. the ideas all sound so good on paper, but are poorly executed across the board. that’s why the movie feels so underwhelming.

cage is by far the best part of this mess, and he is an actor who is born to play dracula. he hams it up in every scene, and his unhinged take is genuinely scary but also goofy. his manic line delivery and unhinged inflection of such dialogue gems like “hail satan” is absolute bliss.

the blood and gore is over-the-top and mostly used in a humorous manner, but this isn’t for the squeamish. there is graphic throat ripping, spurting blood, and abdomens slit open with internal organs visibly spilling out. mckay doesn’t shy away from the violence (and the makeup and effects are really great), which should at least delight horror fans.

with such a great idea for story, it’s a bummer that “renfield” is disappointing in nearly every way imaginable. you’ll find yourself mourning what it could have been.

8346,"i was not expecting much from renfield and it pretty much gave me exactly what i was expecting: a mediocre film that was nothing offensive but all too forgettable.

the screenplay is really all over the place. there are too many subplots and not enough time spent on the actual draw to the film, dracula. awkwafina's subplot was half baked and really did not go anywhere. i felt as though her character could have entirely been written out of the film to spend more time on renfield and dracula. the comedy is pretty bad. i do not remember laughing one time during the hour-thirty-minute runtime. there were clear jokes that they were trying to set up, but they just did not land for me.

performances were fine. nicholas cage was great as dracula, but unfortunately did not have enough screen time or material to really make a huge impact on the film. nicholas holt was good in his role, but again i do not think he had much to work with. everyone else gave really average performances. awkwafina plays literally the same style of character as she did in shang chi, and it was fine, but nothing that really blew me away.

the direction was pretty poor. so many action scenes had a tremendous amount of shaky cam and some weird motion blur type effect that made it really hard to see what was happening. it was brutal, don't get me wrong, and i loved what they attempted to go for, but it really just landed flat. coming off from john wick just a few weeks ago, the action direction was apparently bad. the gore was at an extreme, but for the love of god, why did they choose to use cgi blood? the graphics literally looked like something out of a ps2 mortal kombat; absolutely terrible. which is a shame because that mixed with the poor action direction really took me out of every scene when i should have been locked in having a bloody good time.

overall, this film is a misstep in what could have been a fun, campy, cult classic. the jumbled screenplay, poor stunt choreography, and terrible effects really hold this movie back from its true potential. there is nothing truly awful that make this a bad movie, just enough there to make it an extremely average experience.

in a sense then this film could be said to be set in any of the battlefields, in any asian country, the us has invaded. the fact it has a futuristic overlay, does not detract from powerful and often moving, anti-war, pro peace message, it compellingly conveys. it could not be more timely either, given the us's attempts, to light wars across the world.

such a disappointing movie. adam driver is a great actor but this movie is so incredible boring. 90% of the movie are encounters to another and then another and then another dangerous blood seeking dino. just when you think the story might get anywhere there is another dino to shoot.  slowly you are realizing there is no more extra story. it is just a short journey to a top of a hill fighting dino's. and adam is a father of a 9 year old but then on this journey he has to do the journey with another 9 year old (which looks too old) and suddenly  becomes like the dumbest not able to communicate person in the world.  such a waist of actor talent and special effects money. my guess is that the makers have cgi or vision art backgrounds because the only thing well done in this movie are the special effects.",low
8367,"the best way i can describe this effort is a contemporised, misinterpretation, of dumas novel. 

if, like me, you have read the three musketeers novel, more than once, you'll find this film largely divorced, from that work. the inconsistencies are glaring. 

the most obvious is steering this tale away from its focus on the male leads, in favour of not necessarily peripheral but definitely secondary or tertiary, female characters. yes, in my opinion, its yet another clumsy chance to hoist the flag of feminism. making female characters relevant to the story, in the modern woke context. of course, this predictably, unbalances the story. the musketeers, are, nudged into the background, in the own tale. 

the second point of failure is the age of d'artagnan, who in past films is typically played by a young male actor because this tale, in a sense, is a coming of age story. that's all swept aside too, quite possibly in service to the feminisation of the story.instead, he's portrayed by a 33 year old man, incongruously called, ""a boy"". suffice to say, it all feels rather awkward.

are there any redeeming elements to the production? obviously, the acting is sound, its a strong cast. money has been spent on sets, settings, fight choreography and more, to try to bring this period in french history, to life.

regrettably, so much else is wrong that this film simply feels ""openly fake"", to this reviewer. i do not see it as a loyal expression, of dumas sterling work. nor the period, in which it is set.

in summary,feminises an essentially masculine tale. don't believe me, just look at the poster, not to mention the film itself. in my view  there are numerous superior and more accurate, cinematic expressions of dumas work, on offer.",low

seriously, the pope's exorcist was better and everyone knew that was going to flop.  i'm going to tell you right now that you should go back and watch the prequel movies because they were better... both of them.

you have two little girls, a strong anti-catholic message, a strong anti-patriarchy message, you know... the usual hollywood meh messaging (except the anti-catholic part, that is a dead horse that hasn't been beaten nearly as much) and, most importantly, the same sequel/reboot/franchise killer that seems to go out of it's way to insult all the fans of the original film...

... and everyone that helped make it.  which, honestly, is also a dead horse that's been beaten too much these days.  in fact, insulting the original is sort of a trope these days.

people that actually like terminator: dark fate are going to rave about this one... but everyone else is going to roll their eyes because at the end of the day, it has the exact same boring message as everything else.

8371,"as the son of parents who were childhood sweethearts/soul mates, i tend to be a sucker for movie romances that address this subject. in this case, however, the only “sucker” aspect applies to the money i plunked down to watch this two-hour snoozefest. writer-director celine song’s debut feature has been praised as a masterful piece of filmmaking and one of the best pictures of 2023, but i heartily beg to disagree. when a pair of young, tightly knit korean friends, nora (greta lee) and hae sung (teo yoo), part ways from their native seoul and are later reunited in new york after a 24-year separation, the reunion of these childhood pals provides them with an opportunity to reflect on what might have been. however, their time together consists mostly of a series of overly bloated pregnant pauses, inane dialogue and missed chances to discuss much of anything meaningful, the kinds of scenes that make even the most patient viewers want to yell “get on with it already!” these “conversations” come nowhere close to matching their joy of their spirited youthful interactions or the heartfelt, substantive talks that later take place between nora and her husband, arthur (john magaro). the result is, quite frankly, a big fat bore that’s trying to be more than it is but never achieves that outcome. perhaps the biggest problem with this is the film’s truly sincere but decidedly paper thin narrative that doesn’t have the writing support to bring it all into beautiful full bloom, despite some fine performances, exquisite cinematography and an emotive background score. from this, the director would appear to have a hefty reserve of potential stashed away, at least based on this offering’s stylistic elements, but the substance could use some definite shoring up. let’s hope her next effort lives up to that.",low
8372,"wow. for a director, celine song, just coming out of the gate, this is quite an impressive film. the lead actress, greta lee, fit the role like a soft leather glove, which speaks volumes, both for her talent, and for song's casting. lee's hollywood critics association best actress award is well-deserved.

song wrote an excellent screenplay, and her direction turned it into a stunning film. kudos to a24 for taking a chance on her. i presume they are happy with the outcome. it's rather interestingly paced in a buddhist or asian kind of way - slow, meditative, and more is shown than is said. overall, it's not a perfect film, but it's close.

this isn't precisely a coming-of-age movie, but the plot revolves around that (perhaps even more difficult,) developing period between the ages of 20 and mid-30s. i've held a long-standing belief that our life chapters change every seven years. you know: there are seven chakras, seven days in a week, the seven sisters (pleiades), or whichever mystical seven you'd like. over the course of three of these ""theoretical"" chapters, this movie focuses on two relationships in the protagonist's life, from roughly twenty-one (7*3) to approximately forty-two (7*6). she was married at about the time of a chapter shift (7*5), as if to validate my weird belief. in my world, it all makes sense.


this movie is certainly somewhat autobiographical, even by song's own admission. it will be added to my directors about themselves list. i can't wait to see celine's next project!",high

8383,"beau is afraid certainly boasts an incredibly rich and intricate narrative, filled with a plethora of allegories, symbolisms, and thematic elements. however, one may question whether the complexity of the film is worth sacrificing entertainment value. in attempting to weave together these complex themes, ari aster has created a narrative that was very difficult for me to fully process.

during the first hour of the movie, i found myself engrossed in the story, with tense scenes that blurred the lines between what is real and what is fake. however, as the film progressed, these surreal scenes became increasingly wild and disjointed, leaving me feeling disconnected from the narrative. i found myself constantly asking questions about what was happening, how we got there, and why things were unfolding the way they were. this detachment ultimately detracted from my overall enjoyment of the film.

at three hours in length, beau is afraid can be a daunting task for audiences to undertake. while a well-paced film can fly by (avatar: the way of water and babylon for instance), this one felt like a slog at times, and i found myself frequently checking the clock to see how much time was left. however, despite these shortcomings, the technical execution of the film was truly exceptional. aster's direction was brilliant, with stunning camera work and beautiful cinematography. the acting was also top-notch, with joaquin phoenix delivering what was arguably the best performance of the year so far. the supporting cast, including amy ryan, patti lupone, and nathan lane, also gave standout performances.

all in all, beau is afraid was quite a letdown for me. while aster undoubtedly has a brilliant mind and a talent for storytelling, this film may have suffered from a lack of restraint. nonetheless, the technical prowess and stellar performances are certainly noteworthy and should not be overlooked.

absolutely wonderful. i can't do a big braining on what everything means in this crazy topsy-turvy roller-coaster of a movie, but it's one hell of an entertaining ride if you just sit back and enjoy it. for me, this movie needed to be watched the same way i watched lost highway - don't try to understand it, just be open to being frightened and entertained. 

suffering from generalized anxiety myself, the first part of the movie is absolutely brilliant, showing the world through the lens of someone with a severe case of anxiety. everything is over the top, and the attention to detail is stunning.

the movie devolves further and further into madness, somewhat akin to the way it did in mother, except not in a frustrating way, but rather an action-packed and crazy, sometimes touching way. oh, and hilarious. there are such funny moments in this movie, often absurdly so.

i didn't read up on anything before watching this movie, and i had no idea it was going to be three hours. i didn't know ari aster made it, and frankly i didn't know who he was. looking it up afterwards, i see he made midsommar, which i found tedious and boring, and hereditary, which i absolutely loved.

i can definitely see how someone could hate this movie. i can also sympathize with being frustrated with it if trying to understand everything. i think the best way to watch this is popcorn. watch this like you'd watch a popcorn flick, except expect absurdities instead of explosions (though we do get explosions here, too). that's how you'll be entertained by this amazing movie. i'll be watching this again.

admittedly, the fish-out-of-water premise is a good one. the story outline is fine, but the execution is a debacle. although they are working within a very broad parameter of mass appeal, the screenwriting trio’s (amanda sthers, j. michael feldman, and debbie jhoon) script feels like a struggle to stay above water. the writing talks down to the audience and narrative includes dumb scenarios that feel like a sad sack’s fantasy (the worst being a hunky local guy (giulio corso) who is instantly smitten by kristin the second she lands in rome, and the eventual “twist” that anyone with half a brain can see coming from a mile away). it’s also filled with tired italian stereotypes and has such a strong desire to be a “cool and different kind of comedy” that it earns an r rating with bloody violence and a bunch of cursing.

even worse is collette’s performance, which is an overblown exercise in desperation and overacting. her take on the timeworn goofy, gullible american shtick feels like a huge stretch, to the point where her character becomes a weak caricature of a real woman. kristin is a complete clown, even in a film that is trying (but not exactly succeeding) to tell a story of female empowerment. it’s a tragic waste of collette’s talent. she is so much better than this.

i can’t think of anything positive to say about “mafia mamma.” even your worst enemy deserves better.

8399,"there’s a bear high on mass quantities of illegal drugs that is going on a murderous rampage in a tennessee state park in “cocaine bear,” an absolutely awful action / horror movie from director elizabeth banks. i understand with a premise like that, it’s supposed to be stupid. the problem is that the movie isn’t just dumb, it’s actually bad, with poor direction, acting, cgi, writing, and storytelling.

loosely based on true events (yes, really), the film is inspired by the 1985 story of a drug runner’s plane crash. in order to save a large quantity of cocaine, the man threw out several duffel bags full of the stuff over tennessee and then jumped to his death when his parachute didn’t open. a black bear got into the drugs, consumed most of it and, according to experts, immediately died. this movie imagines what could have happened if the bear didn’t die from ingesting all that booger sugar. in this bloody and gory version, the 500 pound apex predator goes bananas and kills everyone in sight.

it’s a fictional story that is stretched too thin, especially with the meager subplots about a single mom (keri russell), her missing daughter (brooklynn prince) and friend (christian convery), a group of criminals (ray liotta, o’shea jackson jr., alden ehrenreich), two park rangers (margo martindale, jesse tyler ferguson), a police detective (isiah whitlock jr.), and random tourists and teenagers that must think on their toes in order to avoid being the bear’s next victim. jimmy warden‘s script is atrocious because he’s trying to force a story that’s not at all compelling nor complex. the actors give clunky performances and character-wise, there just isn’t a whole lot to root for.

banks isn’t the most skilled director, and a film like this certainly doesn’t demand a whole lot of talent behind the camera. but there’s something that consistently feels “off” with her style and tone, especially in the random, mostly unsuccessful jokes. the humor didn’t work for me at all, and when i did muster a laugh, i wasn’t doing so because the movie was good — i was laughing because the movie was so dumb. i understand that a movie about a huge bear ingesting a bounty of blow is supposed to be dumb, but it also has to be good in order to work, and this movie is not.

to become a cult classic, a movie must be one that you’d want to watch on repeat. “cocaine bear” is simply not funny enough, not campy enough, and not kooky enough to succeed. it’s nothing but a one-joke trainwreck.

8400,"**_not funny enough as a comedy and too silly to take serious_**
 
in 1985, several bags of cocaine fall from a drug smuggling plane in the mountainous area of northern georgia and eastern tennessee. near blood mountain, a mother black bear eats a lot of the cocaine and goes on a bloody spree as it menaces hikers, rangers, thugs, emts and cops.

“cocaine bear” (2023) is a campy creature feature inspired by the true story directed by, of all people, elizabeth banks. it was ray liotta’s second to last movie before his death on may 26, 2022. keri russell is on hand as the concerned mother of a tween hiker. in real-life the black bear weighed 175 lbs, but this was changed to almost 400 lbs for the movie.

the production unbelievably cost $35 million. i say “unbelievably” because this is a decidedly throwaway creature feature of the semi-goofy syfy variety. the cgi is a little superior, but not enough to make any appreciable difference. i’m speaking as someone who enjoys some of the better syfy flicks on occasion. a good example is “sasquatch mountain” (2006), aka “devil on the mountain,” which only cost $800,000.

except for the lush scenery (shot in ireland, locations listed below), this is decent but generally meh. it’s not humorous enough as a comedy, but you can’t take it serious either because it’s too goofy. it doesn’t help that keri is the only female worth mentioning (as a footnote at that).

how this garnered as much attention as it did is a great mystery. “grizzly park” (2008) treaded similar terrain and, while far from a great movie, is more entertaining than this (at a fraction of the budget). 

the film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot south of dublin, ireland, in barnaslingan, powerscourt and, further south, avoca.

grade: c-",low
8401,"i got excited for this one, i mean it's 2023 and cocaine bear had the promise of not being political.  it had the promise of not having meh message.  it had the promise of not being serious.

i mean, the bear was obviously the star.  people were going to see it because they wanted to see a giant bear high on coke killing people in a mindless and humorous way...

... but.... something happened with the direction.  the humor was clearly there on paper.  that was evident enough, but the delivery was... meh.  the jokes didn't land because they ran too long, the timing was off, everything was there for it to be funny and fun... it just feels like it was made by a director that can't tell a joke.

8404,"writer-director wes anderson has lost his way, and this film proves it. i realize that the auteur’s signature style of filmmaking is an acquired taste, and, to his credit, he’s made some fine pictures over the years. but this one is not among them. in fact, contrary to many of the inexplicable claims that this is his finest release, i’d contend just the opposite. it’s arguably his worst, a meandering, cryptic, unfocused piece that’s so muddled you’ll need the assistance of a search party to find your way out of it (that is, if you even care by the time the end of this overlong mess rolls around). the director appears to have become so enamored with his own eccentricity that it doesn’t even seem to matter to him whether or not viewers are on the same page as he is. admittedly, this offering once again captures anderson’s singularly stylish look with a stunning production design and gorgeous cinematography. but that’s all it has going for it, and that’s unfortunate given the phenomenal cast he has available to him. what’s more, despite his proficiency in creating superb visual style, he’s forgotten about pairing it with meaningful (or even interesting) substance. its incomprehensibility and inclusion of bits that are there just for the sake of their own whimsy seriously undercut any effort to make this an intelligible work. in short, “asteroid city” is yet another major disappointment in what is turning out to be a dreadfully dismal summer movie season. it’s likely to appeal only to diehard fans of the director (and maybe not even a lot of them this time out). if you’re on the fence about this one, consider the following two telling tipoffs: (1) when no one in the theater is laughing at what’s been billed as a comedy, that should speak volumes about it (as happened at the screening i attended); and (2) when you consider how aggressively and ubiquitously the distributors have been promoting this film in ads on tv and the internet, it’s obvious they’re trying awfully hard to peddle shabby, substandard merchandise. this is a huge waste of time and money; don’t squander yours.",low
8407,"most critics have their personal favorite directors, and it’s sometimes a challenge to keep strict objectivity when reviewing one of their projects. that’s why it pains me to write about “asteroid city,” the sluggish, smug, exasperating new film from co-writer and director wes anderson. in what is unquestionably his worst film by a mile, anderson leans too heavily on his ordered, signature visual symmetry, saturated color palate, and a-list cast while completely forgetting how to make an entertaining movie.

the film takes place in a tiny desert town (famous for their giant crater) where the junior stargazers and space cadets are holding their awards convention. the event brings together students and their parents, all oddballs in their own right, from all over the country. when a ufo is spotted, the visitors are quarantined until the government deems it safe for them to return to the real world.

the plot is thin yet confusing, as the film simultaneously depicts the events of the convention in the form of a stage play, the creation of the play, and the actual events in a retro version of 1955. with so much going on, you’d think it would be at least mildly interesting, but the movie is sluggish and packed with conversational and head-scratching filler that lends nothing to the story.

there is a wacky cast of (too many) characters, and only a handful turn out to be memorable. the expected roster of anderson regulars make an appearance (jason schwartzman, edward norton, adrien brody, tilda swinton, jeffrey wright, scarlett johansson) as well as big names that are new to working with the director (bryan cranston, tom hanks, maya hawke, matt dillon, steve carell, liev schreiber, hong chau, jake ryan). it’s a dream of a cast list, but this film goes to show that a talented roster doesn’t always result in a gem. there’s nothing wrong with any of the performances, but it’s the source material that needs a lot of work.

“asteroid city” may be visually delightful, but it is filled with a detached, hipster indifference that’s off-putting. this is one of the biggest failures of the year, and it’s not because the film is “too wes anderson-y,” nor is it because of the general anderson fatigue: this movie is a series of flagrant missteps that cause the project to flounder and fall.",low

8411,"**not sure if it's a good christian movie, but it's a great horror movie**

great movie, even though in a way it sets itself up for failure, because a christian audience doesn't usually appreciate a good psychological horror movie and horror fans usually don't like a movie made by christians promoting christian values.

so there is no big demographic that really appreciates a movie like this and it's obvious that the makers of this movie knew that too and were doing it to simply make a good movie for those who can appreciate it (no matter how few there might be).

so i am not sure if it even really wants to be a good christian movie or a good psychological horror movie, but either way it does succeed at being both.

for a movie about demonic possession it's also surprisingly realistic. and i say that as someone who has worked as a guard in prisons and mental institutions. there are a few extremely minor inaccuracies but these are necessary for the plot or are for safety reasons (after all, not everyone needs to know what exactly the actual safety measures in a prison actually look like in detail).

there actually already is an almost identical german movie called ""der totmacher"" (the deathmaker). though i am sure no one involved in this movie saw it, even though it's essentially the same movie and that's because that german movie's entire script simply consists entirely of the actual transcripts of an actual psychological evaluation of an actual serial killer. but that's how close to reality this all actually is.",high
8412,"ext. indiana jones and the temple of the lost dials skull – day

indiana jones and the dial of destiny is more closely related to its recent sequel than its distant cousins of the original trilogy. it attempts to take the franchise's formula and shake it up; it throws in cameos, call-backs and references but suffers the same issue every recent lucasfilm movie has. 

it's another modern disney reboot sequel with legacy characters left in the dirt, and a 'quirky & quippy' new character is presented to us. you know this character type when in the face of fear, they will make fun of the villain's lactose intolerance or something random because this character is flawlessly confident. they are knowledgeable on every subject relevant to the plot, smartasses because they are always correct, sassy when held hostage and always have an escape plan. this is helena (phoebe waller-bridges), and she might be the only consistent character in the film. for the rest of the ensemble, boyd holbrooks klaber speaks once in the movie and then chases after jones in each scene; mads mikkelsens jürgen voller is the most forgettable antagonist of the franchise, antonio banderas is out of the film faster than he's in it and finally, harrison ford as dr jones is unfortunately back for what seems like a pretty good paycheck.

i have nothing against the performances themselves. the cast is incredibly talented, but this skilled team cannot hide the terrible dialogue reinforcing the rather forgettable story. ultimately, indiana jones has one of the greatest trilogies of films with a distance spin-off universe of sequels. lucasfilm, post-2008, has not been your era.

and now... thank you doomcock, without your intervention this movie would have been even worse.  it shows, the plot is messy, the re-shoots are a little obvious story-wise as disney did their best to attempt to avoid the fan backlash promised for when their plans were to kill indy off and have phoebe replace him....

... and then when when they re-shoot it again because the fans didn't want to see indiana jones be ridiculed constantly by his female replacement in an effort to make the kk stand-in come across as better in every way... and a lot of that is still there in the final product.

like star wars did to skywalker, indiana jones is constantly shamed by the younger more diverse version... who can't seem to decide what character she wants to be.  rogue?  scholar?  conman? her personality changes as the script dictates, but indiana remains pathetic... so that strong female lead can look better.

in the end it's a mess, and the result is that disney killed another fan favorite franchise.  star wars, willow, and now indy.  they paid out the nose for all of them and then made them worthless.

an incredibly well-written and extremely well-acted piece of dramatic cinema about the very eventful and complicated life of j. robert oppenheimer and it is beautiful. i'm actually surprised this is a huge summer blockbuster.

anytime christopher nolan releases a film, it's obviously an event all around the world because he's made tons of great films and he's one of the very few film-makers working today who really cares about cinema and values that cinematic experience. he's also one of the very few people who's actually given a budget to support his love for cinema. he shoots on film, does everything practically, he wants as little cgi as possible and he has apparently claimed that there isn't a single cgi shot in this film. if that's actually the case, like if he hasn't even included cleanup shots in the film, then my spirit just left my body. it's astounding.

went into this film with very limited knowledge about the life of oppenheimer. like most people, i only knew him as the father of the atomic bomb and the famous lines he quoted from the bhagavad gita which are now i am become death, the destroyer of worlds where he's talking about the atomic bomb realising the gravity of his creation and having to live with the sin of his achievement. i had no other knowledge about him as a person, his life outside of the invention, and the events that followed before or after it. so, if you're going into this film expecting an explosion porn, you're most likely to get disappointed having to sit through 3 hours' worth of heavy dramatic dialogue involving moments of genuinely terrifying character development. the film is about the person whose most pivotal moment in life was the success of the manhattan project. getting to experience being inside that person's mind as he's trying to visualize all these things combined with an incredible score by ludwig göransson and watching all of these rated-r, 3-hour, dialogue-heavy, beautifully shot on film by the master himself hoyte van hoytema with black and white sequences in a fucking theatre made me feel like i wasn't in 2023.

the performances are excellent. there really is no other word for it. from the top all the way down to the bottom of the incredibly huge cast list, there isn't a single weak link. robert downey jr. is simply terrific. i haven't seen him like this since kiss kiss bang bang which came all the way back in 2005. i love him as iron man but that's more about the character rather than him as an actor. i wouldn't be shocked if he's nominated for a best supporting actor performance. emily blunt is also just really really great. there is a sequence early on in the film where oppenheimer is being questioned and she's just sitting back there in the scene, out of focus. we're not even shown a close-up of her during this entire sequence until it becomes relevant later on in the film and we go back to that sequence when we finally realise the significance of her being there. nolan has done quite a lot of that in this film actually. major a-list actors are in the film for like 2 scenes and then they never appear again. that's not just a testament to the actors who'd give anything to be in a nolan-directed film but a testament to nolan himself, as a film-maker. if we go back to the same sequence i mentioned earlier with blunt, that's not just anyone sitting there, it's emily blunt. a phenomenal actress. but that's what gives the film a sense of groundedness. that the people on-screen are actual people, they behave like people. and for a certain amount of time, allows those celebrities to feel like normal people. florence pugh, matt damon, rami malek, jason clarke, dane dehaan, i can go on and on but literally everyone is fucking phenomenal. the real star of the show though, is cillian murphy. in his first lead role for a nolan film after having worked with him for almost 20 years, murphy shines brighter than the atomic bomb itself and walks with suave leaving not just two, but a multitude of shockwaves. his work is beyond phenomenal here. he not only looks like oppenheimer but every scene he's in, he's just instantly captivating. it's not just his incredible eyes (which go so deep that i just wanna sink myself in them) but, he's just always in character. never did i once see the guy from red eye or from peaky blinders. it was always oppie.

i'm actually putting this review as i listen to the absolutely bonkers score that has been provided for the film. göransson's work is truly, awesome-tacularly, riveting. my heart was beating so fast in some sequences that have this heavy, beating sounds that i could almost have a seizure. the work here is truly remarkable.

another aspect of this film that shines brighter than ever is its editing. this is a 3-hour film that feels like 2 and a half. a half-an-hour of time just evaporated for me. every scene ends perfectly. there is no room for baggage. several big moments of history fly away in an instant. this gives the film a really focused feel. it gives the audience a cue that this is not the story of the world but it is the story of oppenheimer. nolan really knows how to edit his films such that they have just the right runtime and i really appreciate when a film-maker does that. it very much also gives this film that documentary-esque aspect and gets you convinced that these events actually did happen and this is not just some made-up story about a man's life.

this film is truly a marvelous achievement not just for christopher nolan himself as a filmmaker but for cinema as a whole. peak dramatic cinema. watch this on the biggest screen possible and the loudest speakers you can find.",high

8455,"there’s a sweet life lesson at the heart of “no hard feelings,” the supposed “raunchy comedy” from co-writer and director gene stupnitsky. what a shame that it’s buried under a heap of dreadfully unfunny attempts at humor, dumb pratfalls,and tired sex jokes that fall flat one hundred percent of the time. no bones about it: this is not just a really terrible comedy, it’s an awful movie all around.

bartender maddie (jennifer lawrence) just watched her car get towed from the driveway, and needs wheels, fast. while browsing the want ads, she stumbles upon an intriguing job listing: wealthy helicopter parents (laura benanti, matthew broderick) are searching for someone to “date” their introverted 19-year-old son, percy (andrew barth feldman), before he leaves for college. the pay for sleeping with their son? a used buick. maddie decides to take the job but in the process, she gets far more than she bargains for.

it’s a decent premise for a movie, but lawrence is horribly miscast in the role. she’s too old to play the part of maddie, which makes her relationship with a teenager feel a little icky. lawrence is also called on to do a lot of comedy work and as talented as she is, she simply lacks the knack for comedic timing (she’s especially awful at physical comedy).

it’s also a problematic message to send to young men: if you haven’t slept with a woman before venturing away from home and off into adulthood, then you aren’t much of a “man.” just think if the roles were reversed here, and it was a 32 year old man trying to force himself on a 19 year old woman so she could get “experience” before heading to college. the standard needs to be the same regardless of the sex of the main characters.

the majority of the story consists of ridiculous situations where maddie is aggressively trying to seduce percy, none of them funny and all of them growing old, quickly. stupnitsky (and co-writer john phillips) go for the lowest hanging fruit every time, and the only laughter i could muster while watching this dreck came from forced chuckles.

and that’s the major problem with the movie: everyone is trying so hard to turn it into a wacky, racy comedy that they miss the actual heart of the story.

the relationship between maddie and percy is somewhat charming, and the way they grow individually while together is actually heartwarming. all of that is overshadowed by the lame attempts to make it a raunchy, sexy, adult comedy. in struggling to be both, it succeeds at neither.

unfortunately it doesn't work, jennifer lawrence is just a horrible person in this.  from pretty much start-to-finish she is a horrible human being, and in order for this story to work she needs to be likeable.  she needs to be relatable.  she needs to be someone that the male protagonist would actually fall for...

... and instead she's the type of person that you don't want to know.  she's not even a rougish charmer.  she's not a lovable con artist.  she's just completely unappealing.  and that is why the film doesn't work.

andrew barth feldman comes across as legitimately socially awkward, but he also comes across as someone that doesn't want to be around her, and doesn't like her because of her completely toxic qualities.  

the script is at least aware enough to include that... but then does a 180 where he has to pretend that, after dealing with her, he actually wants to be around her... because the plot requires it.

for some reason he doesn't want to have sex with her because he is awkward, not because she is awful. which makes it a little unbelievable.  

i suppose in their effort to show that jennifer don't need no man, they forget that they were making her into someone no one would want to be around long enough to bang.  if they wrote her as someone that at least hesitated to ruin the fun of little kids.... they could have had a win.  instead they went for completely charmless.",low

""elemental"" stands out as one of the most visually colourful movies with excellent music, including a memorable end credits song. while children may not fully grasp the film's deep concepts, it leaves a lasting impact on their lives, and when they revisit it as adults, they will come to understand its profound message.",high
8474,"slightly forced 1980s aesthetic/nostalgia trip aside, <em>'air'</em> is quality!

the 80s was before my time, so i guess i'm not best placed to talk about it, but the constant shots of 80s things with 80s music with extremely 80s enviroments did get a tiny bit tiresome to me. i recall people saying similar-ish with <em>'stranger things'</em> season 3, though i found the mix of it there to more befitting. i'm nit-picking, i know, but it just was super noticeable to me here.

anyway, enough of that unimportant stuff. the film is great. the whole cast do terrific work, particularly matt damon, viola davis (the phone call scene between those two is excellent), jason bateman and ben affleck. i'd say the secondary portion of the almost 2hrs is the stronger, prior to that i was intrigued but not invested... by the end i was both. it's a predictable story, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.

the decision to practically not have a michael jordan character in a movie about michael jordan is an interesting one. it feels a tad awkward when he is in a scene and they intentionally 'hide' him. i get why, and it mostly works, but it does feel dorky at a point or two.

8489,"i hate to admit it, but i allowed myself to be suckered in to this one as a result of its rambunctiously funny trailer only to be grossly disappointed at what i saw. this is a positively dreadful film, and i’m at a complete loss to understand how viewers have found it funny. when a pair of lesbian high school students (rachel sennott, ayo edebiri) establish a fight club (i.e., a euphemistically labeled “self-defense program”) as a means to surreptitiously bed down their cheerleader classmates (a story line that’s more than a little dubious in itself), they subsequently launch into a meandering narrative that makes little sense and plays like it was made up by a group of stoners who’ll laugh at anything when suitably smoked up. the film starts out trying way too hard and then proceeds to quickly go downhill from there. much of the material is in questionable taste, too, such as sequences that feature unrestrained physical abuse against women, as well as other forms of sanctioned violence. how is this stuff supposed to be funny? “bottoms” has been described by viewers and critics as a go-for-broke/anything-for-a-laugh comedy, but i found its distasteful stabs at humor cringeworthy at best. what’s more, the picture’s feeble attempts at trying to inject the narrative with a message related to women’s empowerment are completely betrayed by its many wrong-headed plot devices. to the film’s credit, it does feature some passable performances by its supporting cast (most notably punkie johnson, dagmara dominczyk and former nfl star marshawn lynch). but, sadly, this effort is a big step down for director emma seligman and writer-actor rachel sennott, both of whom turned in brilliant work in their raucous collaboration, “shiva, baby” (2020) (not to mention that sennott’s casting represents a laughable choice for someone who’s nearly 28 attempting to portray an 18-year-old character). it’s also quite a comedown for producer elizabeth banks, who scored big earlier this year with the utterly hilarious “cocaine bear.” it occurred to me after watching this debacle that maybe i’m just getting old and losing my sense of humor, but, after thinking it over, i realized that’s genuinely not the case. this may indeed represent a case of changing movie tastes, but, if that’s so, i’m seriously troubled about the direction in which those tastes are headed.",low

at the start, the main character walks up to some guy and says 'i'm gonna taze you in the balls', and does so. instead of spending the rest of the movie in a jail cell on sexual assault charges, and then getting sued into the ground, the film just goes on. (the victim was a white male, so modern hollywood wants you to think it's 'funny' rather than disgusting.) from that point on, the main character is in no way an innocent victim, so it's hard to care that she's being pursued by a killer. the plot is mediocre, there are no funny or cool characters that the viewer might actually care about, and the killer's identity has reached the level of 'roommate's friend's brother's dogwalker', aka 'who cares'. very forgetable.",low

8507,"the first question i asked myself after leaving the theater after screening “book club: the next chapter” was “wait a minute, did this movie even have a script?” the story is so paper-thin that it seems like a long improv session between four of the most charming actresses over 70. the sad (or great?) thing about this is that it doesn’t really matter, because co-writer and director bill holderman unapologetically made this movie for a target audience that will gobble it up and leave wanting more.

all facing different milestones in their lives, four best friends diane (diane keaton), vivian (jane fonda), sharon (candice bergen), and carol (mary steenburgen) decide to take their book club to italy for the fun girls trip they never had. with the news that one of their own has recently gotten engaged, the gals use it as an excuse to have a whirlwind bachelorette party. the relaxing vacation turns into a cross country journey that takes them from rome to tuscany and beyond on an adventure of a lifetime.

there isn’t much substance to this senior citizen fluff, and just because it’s watchable does not mean it’s entertaining. there are a lot of vapid scenes that do nothing to further the narrative, and the film has close to zero story or plot. astute viewers (to be honest, even those who have only seen a handful of hallmark movies) will figure out the big surprise long before its overlong reveal, leaving most of the audience bored, trying to savor the lovely scenery of the italian countryside.

the cast is terrific, but i wouldn’t call what they’re doing “acting.” it’s more like a camera has been turned on a group of old friends having fun together. they’re drinking wine and eating mountains of pasta, spinning yarns and puttering around italy. co-screenwriters holderman and erin simms pander to their demographic with plenty of old lady one-liners and slightly raunchy wordplay that’ll make grandma blush.

it’s so nice to see older actors getting work, and craig t. nelson, don johnson, andy garcia are well cast and provide a little testosterone to the story (although all of the men are portrayed as hopelessly romantic, and their grand gestures are laughable). this one is all about the ladies, though, and each one is irresistible in their own way. their chemistry is believable and authentic, which makes these characters part of group to which we’d all love to belong. if not for the charisma of the cast, this film would sink even harder and faster.

“book club: the next chapter” is not a good movie. it’s dumb, predictable, and lacks sophistication. despite it all, the film reaches its ultimate goal of being a sweetly enchanting fairy tale for moms and grandmas everywhere.",low
8516,"the one thing a good whodunnit should not do is put its audience to sleep. unfortunately, this latest cinematic adaptation of an agatha christie novel fails miserably on this score. director kenneth branagh’s third outing as belgian sleuth hercule poirot is a protracted snooze that leaves viewers caring little about the characters and even less about the story in which they’re trapped. when the famed detective (branagh) – now in retirement in venice – is called upon by a friend and author of murder mysteries (tina fey) to help her verify or discredit the psychic powers of a medium (michelle yeoh) at a séance at an allegedly haunted venetian palazzo, he’s drawn into yet another of his famous investigations. the problem here is that what should be an engaging story is interminably dull, one that, regrettably, prompts frequent checking of one’s watch. moreover, virtually the entire film is shot with excessively dark camera work (so much for showing off the glories of venice). and then there are the performances, which feature good turns by yeoh and jude hill but a positively wooden portrayal by branagh (compared to his previous depictions of the protagonist) and an absolutely dreadful performance by a woefully miscast fey. to its credit, like its recent predecessors, the production values of this christie offering are top shelf, but that’s about all this release has going for it, a far cry from the much better overall work found in “murder on the orient express” (2017) and “death on the nile” (2023). indeed, even fans of the famed mystery writer are likely to find “a haunting in venice” tiresome and tedious. pack a lunch for this one.",low

8525,"""down with the white male patriarchy"" literally that is almost every other sentence, coupled with the ""anti-colonialism"" ethos that is currently seeing people support the execution of children and call for holocaust 2.0...

... the meh messaging didn't exactly age well now that we know how violent it is in practice did it?  and it took less than a year.

otherwise, it has a plot, a kraken trying to pass as human turns into a kraken and meh-essaging.  

ultimately, it's another cartoon that cares more about pushing a political message than it does entertaining the audience.

our faith in the marvel cinematic universe waned throughout phase 4 with films that felt hollow, rushed, and insincere. guardians of the galaxy vol. 3 rekindled my hope as james gunn and the cast’s love and passion for these characters shined in every moment of this beautiful, heartfelt send-off. gunn reminded us of the magic of comic book movies when the storyteller cares more about the characters than the box office. chris pratt, bradley cooper, karen gillan, dave bautista, and the rest of the cast pour themselves into entertaining and genuine performances. this film is surprisingly emotional and had me wondering how they convinced me to care so deeply about such a zany group of goofballs, but that they did. vol. 3 is one of the best conclusions to a film trilogy that had me leave the theater full of satisfaction and nostalgia. while guardians of the galaxy vol. 3 is wonderful in nearly every way, if i had a complaint, it would be the soundtrack felt forced at times rather than complimenting strong moments in the first film. the villain wasn’t exceptional but was better than the average marvel villain, and honestly, vol. 3 wasn’t about the villain or battles as much as it was a farewell to a family of heroes we have all come to love. this movie is well worth your time, and the fantastic effects and cinematography warrant a trip to the cinema to enjoy it to its fullest! mcu doubters need to set aside their skepticism and enjoy saying goodbye to these beloved characters with this outstanding film.",high

i have to admit that it's a bit difficult for me to agree with the mainstream media's warning about this movie, but they really are correct for once - sometimes they throw you curve balls like that. i mean after all, there was a time when i trusted the mainstream media and i lost trust in them not because they were mainstream, but because they just started to get a lot of things wrong. but that also means that if they get things right for once, i can't just categorically disagree with them.

and it's really not like they are just smearing this movie for no good reason. they do (for the most part) have a valid point. this movie does nothing to actually stop this crime or to help the victims or to help people recognize this crime when they see it. on the contrary, because it claims to be based on true events, it causes people to have a completely wrong impression about this and therefore makes it harder for people to detect it when it's happening, because this movie is less accurate in its depiction of the real world than a liam neeson action thriller. actually, liam neeson's recent film ""memory"" was pretty good and actually much more accurate in it's depiction of child trafficking than this movie.

because this movie really does nothing but reinforce outdated and completely wrong stereotypes. this type of thing isn't something that mainly happens in south america or in ""other"" countries and children don't just get kidnapped out of the blue by complete strangers and against their will. the sad truth is that most cases don't involve a stranger at all, but someone the child trusts and the child isn't gonna come running to you begging for help, cause the truth is they are victims of years of extremely systematic and sophisticated psychological manipulation.

and the perpetrators aren't all tough guys either. actually a lot of them are quite educated, sophisticated and female because they don't raise suspicion. and also it's not just about forcing the kids to make movies - that only plays a very, very small part, but this movie would have you believe that that's the main part - that's the smallest part by far! most of the aspects involved are much worse than ""just"" that. 

and as much as i would love to think that there are plenty of officers (official or rogue) of government security agencies who are incorruptible and ceaselessly fight the ""bad guys"" in relentless sting operations, the reality sadly isn't as clear cut. yes, sometimes some children do get rescued, but actually very rarely by police, much less government security agencies. well, there was that one case in bosnia where a policewoman and member of an international agency uncovered a human trafficking operation - but then again the people running it were her colleagues...",low
8611,"one of the greatest surprises of the year has to be “teenage mutant ninja turtles,” a film that i never would’ve expected to be as terrific as it is. co-directed by jeff rowe and kyler spears and co-written by rowe, seth rogen, and evan goldberg, this animated feature is confident, action packed, funny, and is a visual delight. it’s a crowning achievement in animation, and the perfect summer movie to boot.

the film tells the origin story of four turtle brothers, raphael (brady noon), leonardo (nicolas cantu), donatello (micah abbey), and michelangelo (shamon brown jr.), who were mutated after a dangerous laboratory explosion left them covered in radioactive ooze. their adopted father splinter (jackie chan), a kind and elderly new york city sewer rat, has sheltered his teenage sons from the harsh, dangerous, and judgmental human world for over a decade. deciding that they want to be accepted as normal teenagers, the brothers head out into the city on their own, crossing paths with young reporter april o’neil (ayo edebiri). a fast friendship develops, and the turtles find themselves taking on a mysterious crime syndicate that’s run by fellow mutants.

it’s a good story that’s elevated by across-the-board talent. spears and rowe’s crackerjack direction is on point, especially when it comes to orchestrating thrilling action scenes. this is easily one of the most well-directed animated features i’ve ever seen. energetic and bursting with enthusiasm, it’s nearly impossible not to have a blast watching this movie.

the characters are great, too. the turtles may be mutants, but they still act like regular, dumb teenage boys, finding humor in the silliness of everyday experiences. the voice performances are outstanding too, with a talented cast and a diversity that feels natural and appropriate. everyone (including paul rudd, ice cube, john cena, rose byrne, and giancarlo esposito) gives top-tier turns, and it makes the movie even better.

it’s worth noting that this animated film isn’t made for little kids, and youngsters will likely be very bored and fidgety. this is more of a movie that’s geared towards ‘tweens, teens, and their parents (especially dads over 35 who grew up with the ninja turtles in various iterations). i would think longtime fans would be enamored with what the film does to their classic heroes, because a person like me who had very limited knowledge of the characters was quickly won over.

films like “teenage mutant ninja turtles: mutant mayhem” and “spider-man: across the spider-verse” are exciting because not only are they breathing exciting life into the animation genre, they are setting the highest standards for quality, edgy animated films for adults. we should all hope for more projects of this caliber.",high

they really missed an opportunity for if not a great pop culture reference, but at least an in-joke for the punk community.  i mean, throw us a bone here.  he spent half his time mocking us anyway (in a pretty hysterical way) at least give us the laugh when they do the face reveal.

anyway, it's not bad.  miles is less... boring in this cartoon than he is in the comics where he's developed the moniker ""mild morales.""  he actually has more depth of character here and is forced to face some serious choices and turning points (hey marvel, you could learn a lesson here).  

but he also took a bit of a back seat to stacey, who seemed to be the star of the show until there was an abrupt switch... which irritated me.  it sort of screamed ensemble cast, but really it just shifter from one lead to the other a bit abruptly.  as far as complaints go, that's pretty bare bones.

it also gave spidey 2099 a sort of bad spin despite being the most beloved of the 2099 line and the coolest costume design of any spider.  so for us gen-xers, it sort of burned.  at least i'm old enough to have been looking forward to his inclusion only to be a little disappointed.

miles morales (voice of shameik moore) is back for part two, and he’s happily fulfilling his duties as brooklyn’s friendly neighborhood superhero. miles finds himself joining forces with gwen stacy (voice of hailee steinfeld) and a new team of elite spider heroes (featuring the voices of jake johnson, karan soni, issa rae, and others) from across the multiverse as they work together to fight off a powerful villain.

the plot is complex, but the story is terrific. the parallel universes at play don’t feel like a gimmick, and there are real stakes for every character. there are strong messages about teamwork, friendship, power, and responsibility, and it’s nice to see more female representation in a film that prides itself on diversity and inclusion. the story is a little slow at the start, but things pick up ones miles enters the picture. his relationship with gwen is developed extensively here, and they’re a great onscreen duo.

the film is computer-animated, and the visuals are nothing short of masterful. the animation is vibrant, skillfully executed, and absolutely stunning. this is the type of visual art that leaves your eyes begging for more. from the attention to detail to the choice of hues, there isn’t one misstep to be found.

the story, however, has a few stumbles, and most of that stems from the overly long run time (2 hours, 20 minutes), the too-insider easter egg references for diehard comic fans, and the irritating cliffhanger ending that is so obnoxious that it almost ruins everything that came before. thank goodness the rest of the movie is so much fun.

“spider-man: across the spider-verse” is the type of film that proves animation isn’t just for kids, and it’s certainly not a throwaway medium that deserves to be dismissed. it’s an action-packed, visually dazzling, frentic, and outrageously fun piece of cinema. go see it.

8639,"i mean, it's not bad.  it has the message, but it isn't screamed at you at the top of it's lungs like most movies are these days.  in fact, it's so subtle that it's not even much of a distraction.  

not that it doesn't have it's distractions.  it has the same ""because the plot needs it"" occurrences that make you roll your eyes that seem to plague just about every movie these days... but even that is sort of muted.

the themes are fun and decent enough where you would actually want your kids to see it... and in the end it doesn't try to do anything new, it just attempts to make itself into a fun and enjoyable film.  that's really all i ask for in movies, especially these days.  i want to have fun at the box office again, and this movie delivers that.

it's just... you forgot it was even released didn't you?
and you hardly ever heard of the character.  there was next to no publicity.  it wasn't really advertised, it came at a time when people were burned out from all the political super hero movies, and let's face it, everyone is sick of the huge cgi fight with the huge cgi villain/army.

so, at the end you had a bit of a flop, and an undeserving one at that, because the movie is fun, it does entertain, and it deserved more than it got.",high
8647,"the tom cruise “mission impossible” franchise is one of reliable quality and equally dependable “forgettable-ness.” i’ve seen every film, yet my memory is fuzzy when i try to recall what happened in any of them. and while it’s almost a given that “mission: impossible – dead reckoning part one” will somehow sadly meet a similar fate, it’s still one of the best of the bunch. not one thing disappointed me about this seventh installment in the series, an exciting and entertaining ride that gets almost everything right. this is an absolutely terrific action movie that overdelivers, and i loved every minute of it.

world class field agent ethan hunt (tom cruise) works as a field agent for an elite, top-secret branch of the cia called the imf (impossible mission force). his team, including associates luther (ving rhames), benji (simon pegg), and ilsa (rebecca ferguson) have become close friends, and they’re a well-oiled machine when working together. they regroup to embark on a dangerous mission to track down a new weapon that threatens all of humanity. the entire world is at stake, and ethan must find a device before it falls into the wrong hands while dealing with some dark skeletons of his own past.

in order to get the most enjoyment out of the film, it’s best not to read too much about the plot. what works so well about the story is that it has a modern angle, and the motivations of the villains are extremely strong. the stakes are high and there’s a very real danger, which adds to the overall excitement. as one character puts it, they’re fighting “an enemy that’s everywhere and nowhere.” it’s smart, sophisticated, and polished in a way that tends to evade your typical summer blockbuster.

there are a few high tech, double cross, master of disguise elements, but they aren’t used as a distracting gimmick (as they sometimes have been in previous mi films). the high-concept action scenes are energetic and absolutely thrilling, making for some very clever and inventive spectacles. from a dramatic footrace through the canals of venice to motorcycle jumps in the austrian alps to an epic car chase through the streets of rome, there’s never a dull moment. there’s an inspired, extended sequence on a runaway train that will go down in history as one of the most creative and fun action scenes of the year, if not ever.

there are plenty of strong female characters in the story, including the new addition of grace (hayley atwell), a crackerjack larcenist, and paris (pom klementieff), a fierce bodyguard who gives off strong harley quinn vibes. this movie, simply put, is packed with badass women. seeing the gang reunited is always fun, and pegg and rhames have created characters that feel like old friends. there’s excellent work from the supporting cast too (vanessa kirby, esai morales, and shea whigham). cruise is starting to show his age, but he’s still one of hollywood’s greatest working superstars. his performance is reliable, charismatic, and believable, which is exactly what it needs to be.

it’s clear that this is a movie that’s older and wiser and in turn, it’s made with more mature audiences in mind. nothing is dumbed down, the emotional meter runs high, and the level of style and poise is unexpected and welcome (and to be commended). this is a classic espionage thriller that achieves a balance between artistry and pleasure, which is no easy feat.

“mission: impossible – dead reckoning” is the first part of a two part saga, but the finale isn’t so open-ended that it leads to frustration. instead, it’s more of an excitement-based cliffhanger that’ll leave you salivating for the second half. this is a movie that could stand alone, but i’m awfully glad it doesn’t.",high
